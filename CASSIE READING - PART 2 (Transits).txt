Oh a couple other things that may help to know, because I looked at what's happening in the sky right now and how it's hitting your chart specifically.

**Neptune just entered your 6th house** (work zone) at 0° Aries. Neptune is fog, confusion, illusion, unclear boundaries, deception. So if work feels like you literally can't tell what's real vs. what's in your head, or if people are being sneaky, playing victim, or gaslighting you, that's Neptune. It makes everything blurry. You can't see clearly who's actually against you vs. who you're just picking up weird energy from. That's why the "attack" feeling at work is so strong but also so hard to pinpoint. Neptune makes it impossible to see the full picture.

**Uranus is directly opposite your moon right now.** Like within 4 degrees, so it's exact. Your moon is your emotions, your sense of safety, your baseline feelings. Uranus is chaos, sudden change, unpredictability, disruption. So your emotions are all over the place right now. One day you're fine, next day you're spiraling. One moment you feel safe, next moment everything feels unstable. That's not you being crazy or overreacting. That's Uranus shaking up your emotional foundation. You literally can't rely on how you feel day to day because Uranus keeps flipping the script.

**Big picture though, you're about to hit your Saturn Return.** You're 28 years old, and Saturn Return happens between 28 and 30. It's basically Saturn coming back to the exact spot it was when you were born, and it's like a final exam on "did you learn the lesson?" For you, Saturn is in your 6th house (work), so the lesson is around work boundaries, not being a doormat, not overworking, not letting people treat you like shit, and learning how to structure your work life in a way that actually works for you long-term. So all this drama at work? It's forcing you to learn that lesson NOW. Saturn is testing you. Once you set the boundaries, cut off what's not working, and get serious about what you will and won't tolerate, Saturn will reward you with stability and respect. But you have to pass the test first.

**Also, you have 5 planets transiting your 4th house (home/family) right now.** Sun, Mercury, Venus, Mars, and Pluto are all in Aquarius in your 4th house. That's a lot of energy hitting your home life, your private life, your family, your sense of safety at home. So if there's family drama, roommate issues, or just stress at home bleeding into work stress, that's why. Home is not your safe zone right now. It's also part of the chaos. Mars and Pluto together in that zone can create power struggles, intense emotions, or feeling like you have to defend yourself even at home.

**And Neptune is also opposing your Venus right now.** Venus is in your 11th house (friends), and Neptune is in your 6th house (work). Opposition means they're in direct conflict. Neptune is illusion, deception, confusion. Venus is who you value, who you're attracted to as friends, what you think is beautiful or worthy. So when Neptune opposes Venus, you can't tell who's real and who's fake in your friendships. You might be idealizing people who aren't actually safe, or you might be overthinking and seeing betrayal where there isn't any. Either way, Neptune is messing with your ability to see friendships clearly.

**So basically, this whole "feeling attacked" thing is:**

**At work:** Neptune in your 6th house (can't see clearly, people being sneaky or deceptive) + Saturn in your 6th house natally (work is hard, tests, restrictions) + Mars in your 12th house (conflict is hidden, passive-aggressive, behind the scenes).

**With friends:** Neptune opposing Venus (can't tell who's real vs. fake) + Mercury and Venus in your 11th house in Virgo (you're hyper-aware of every detail, overanalyzing) + Uranus in your 7th house (close friendships feel unstable, people are unpredictable).

**Emotionally:** Uranus opposing your moon (emotions are unstable, unpredictable, all over the place) + Moon and Chiron both in your 1st house (you FEEL everything intensely and it shows on your face, plus you have a core wound about being seen and accepted).

**At home:** 5 planets transiting your 4th house (home life is intense, possibly family drama or roommate stress adding to everything else).

**Bottom line: This isn't permanent. It's a clearing and testing season.**

Neptune wants you to see clearly (but first it makes everything foggy so you learn to trust your gut instead of what people say).

Uranus wants you to stand on your own emotionally (by making relationships and emotions unstable so you stop relying on external validation).

Saturn wants you to be strong and set boundaries (by testing your limits at work until you learn to say no and mean it).

You're not going crazy. The universe is just doing a hard reset on your work, friendships, sense of safety, and home life all at once. It sucks right now, but once you pass the tests and clear out what's not working, you'll be way stronger and way more stable than before.

The key is: **Don't chase it. Don't try to fix everyone. Don't prove yourself. Just protect your peace, set your boundaries, and let the people who are showing their true colors remove themselves.** Saturn is forcing you to get strict about what you tolerate. Neptune is forcing you to trust your intuition over what people say. Uranus is forcing you to stop needing everyone to stay the same. 

This is all preparation for a stronger version of you.
