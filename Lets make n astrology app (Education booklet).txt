🌟 ASPECT SPECTRUM SYSTEM
CORE FRAMEWORK
The Key Concepts:
PERCEPTION vs REALITY
* Perception: How energy plays out naturally (the problem)
* Reality: What’s actually going on (the solution = “Aspect Resolution”)
Two-Planet Dynamic:
* Planet One: Thinks they’re right, but needs to recalibrate
* Planet Two: Seems like the problem, but needs to be aligned WITH

THE 7 MAJOR ASPECTS - Complete Journey
Structure:
* Sun anchored at Conjunction (0°)
* Moon travels through 180° arc
* At 180°: Roles REVERSE (Moon becomes Planet One)
* Moon returns to Conjunction (completes 360° cycle)
________________


🔵 1. CONJUNCTION (0°)
Three Phases:
A. Point of Exactitude (Exact 0°)
Perception: Both forced to share space (inhibiting)
Reality: Energies mesh EVENLY - resolve as ONE
Support: BOTH planets EQUALLY SUPPORTED
Leader: HANDOFF POINT (switch leader position)


B. Passing 0° (Moon ahead)
Perception: Sun feels out-of-sync/misdirected
Reality: MOON is now leader (even if slightly ahead)
         Sun must direct shine INTO Moon's needs
Support: Sun SUPPORTED, Moon leads


C. Approaching 0° (Moon returning - after Opposition)
Perception: Sun feels pressured, out-of-sync
Reality: Moon must blend without discord
         Sun must give way, not be only energy
Support: Sun SUPPORTED (by Moon approaching)
Leader: Preparing for RESET to exact 0°


________________


🟢 2. SEMI-SEXTILE (30°)
Outbound (Sun→Moon):
Perception: Sun feels STAGNATED ("oil & water won't mix")
           Hard stop, unseen challenge
Reality: Moon reached area Sun doesn't understand
         "Here vs There" conflict
         Moon's needs = NEXT STEP for Sun
         Blind spot = lack of understanding Moon
Support: Sun SUPPORTED, Moon leads


Inbound (Moon→Sun):
Perception: Sun feels overbearing pressure from Moon
           Doesn't feel understood/supported
Reality: Moon approaching to close cycle
         Must understand where energy lends
         Sun must utilize Moon's influence
Support: Sun SUPPORTED, Moon approaching


________________


🔵 3. SEXTILE (60°)
Outbound:
Perception: Sun sees Moon but doesn't know how much Moon matters
           Missing context, feels left out

Support: Sun SUPPORTED (for Moon's purposes)


________________


🔴 4. SQUARE (90°) - THREE CRITICAL PHASES
A. Approaching 90° (Outbound)
Perception: Sun CONFLICTS with Moon, wants to dominate
           Frustration, requires attention
Reality: Cross-point angle creates conflict
         Focus on SUN's expression
         While ALIGNING with Moon's needs
Support: Sun SUPPORTED
Turnover: NOT YET - still Sun's domain


B. Point of Exactitude (Exact 90°)
Perception: SAME conflict/domination desire
Reality: EQUAL CONSIDERATION required
         BOTH planets support each other's intentions

________________


SQUARE INBOUND (After Opposition):
D. Approaching 90° (Inbound)
Perception: Sun challenged/overshadowed by Moon
           Moon = aggressor, distorts Sun's energy
Reality: Moon serves Sun (even in conflict)
         Must equally express BOTH for Sun's purposes
Support: Moon SUPPORTED


E. Point of Exactitude (2nd time)

________________


🟢 5. TRINE (120°)
Outbound:
Perception: Sun directly contributes to Moon
           Comes naturally, goes UNNOTICED
Reality: Moon is RECEIVER for Sun
         Sun CAN distort/disrupt flow if not intentional
         Sun must know what it's sending
         Must understand how Moon receives

           Separation, compartmentalization
Reality: Moon is natural receiver (like Trine)
         BUT not meant to MERGE
         Sun "AIMS" influence toward Moon
         Extended but DETACHED support
Support: Moon SUPPORTED


Inbound:
Perception: Sun receives input but can't process it
           Doesn't gel, tries to reject
Reality: Moon SENDING energy toward Sun
         Should be directed to do so
         Lends to Sun's scenarios
         Sun must use it to fuel own purposes
Support: Moon SUPPORTED


________________


🔴 7. OPPOSITION (180°) - THE RESET
A. Approaching 180° (Outbound)

Support: BOTH EQUALLY SUPPORTED
Handoff: 2nd HANDOFF POINT - switch leadership


C. Passing 180° (Inbound - Moon now leads)
Perception: Sun feels uneasy, unwanted force from Moon
           Natural instinct to repel
Reality: Moon lends energies in OPPOSITIONAL SUPPORT
         Moon naturally opposes BUT feeds into Sun
         Brings additional context
         Moon stays where it is
Support: Moon SUPPORTED (now as Planet One)


________________


🔄 THE 180° RULE
Key Principles:
Journey Structure:
1. 0°→180°: Sun = Planet One (leader), Moon = Planet Two (advancing)
2. At 180° exact: ROLES SWITCH
3. 180°→0°: Moon = Planet One (leader), Sun = Planet Two (receiving)
Aspect Types:
* Separating (0°→180°): Faster planet leaving toward what’s next
* Applying (180°→0°): Faster planet closing in on pressure
Energy Flow:
* Follows zodiacal directional order (Aries→Pisces)
* Planet One = “the problem”
* Planet Two = “the solution”
* Neither can be neglected
________________


🌙 MINOR ASPECTS (Mentioned)
15° Divisions:
* Form as undercurrent between major aspects
* Rules of energetic harmonics apply
* Levels of consciousness assigned
Quintile Family:
* Quintile: 72° (between major aspects)
* Bi-Quintile: 144° (between major aspects)
* Follow same progression framework
Guidance:
 “If ever unsure, revert back to this framework.”

🎯 FOR YOUR APP
Critical Implementation:
1. Aspect Calculator Must Include:
function analyzeAspect(planet1, planet2, degreeDiff) {
  const aspectType = determineAspectType(degreeDiff); // 0°, 30°, 60°, 90°, 120°, 150°, 180°
  const exactness = calculateExactness(degreeDiff); // exact, applying, separating
  const leader = determineLeader(planet1, planet2, exactness);
  
  return {
    type: aspectType,
    phase: exactness, // "approaching", "exact", "passing"
    planetOne: leader === 'planet1' ? planet1 : planet2,
    planetTwo: leader === 'planet1' ? planet2 : planet1,
    perception: getPerception(aspectType, phase),
    reality: getReality(aspectType, phase),
    support: getSupportStructure(aspectType, phase)
  }
}


2. Interpretation Engine:
User sees: "Sun square Moon"
App displays:
├─ Perception: "You feel conflict between happiness and emotions"
├─ Reality: "Both need equal expression for growth"
├─ Resolution: "Blend energies - don't let one dominate"
└─ Current Phase: "Approaching exact (Sun supported)"


3. Educational Mode:
* Show visual wheel with Sun/Moon journey
* Highlight current phase
* Explain perception vs reality
* Provide alchemy suggestions
________________


🔥 THIS CHANGES YOUR APP DRAMATICALLY
Instead of:
❌ “Sun square Moon means conflict and tension”
You Can Provide:
✅ Dynamic Interpretation Based on Exactness:
* “Your Sun at 10° and Moon at 12° = Approaching Square”
* “Sun currently supported - focus on your happiness”
* “Moon’s needs provide growth opportunity”
* “When exact at same degree = equal expression required”
✅ Alchemy Path:
* “Perception: Feeling torn between self and emotions”
* “Reality: Both are building blocks for purpose”
* “Action: Give equal weight to both - don’t suppress either”
________________


💡 KEY INSIGHTS FOR YOUR APP:
1. Aspects have PHASES (approaching, exact, passing) - changes interpretation
2. Support structure shifts - who’s favored changes throughout aspect
3. Perception ≠ Reality - users experience perception, must learn reality
4. Resolution framework - how to alchemize the energy
5. No aspect is purely “good” or “bad” - all have perception problem + reality solution

TRANSCRIPT #2
🔥 PERFECT! Now I have COMPLETE extractions of Transcripts 2 & 3! Let me create comprehensive extraction documents for both:
________________


📚 TRANSCRIPT 2: “FOUNDATIONS OF INTERPRETATION”
ANGLES, RETROGRADES, RULERSHIPS, & ORBS
________________


I. THE FOUR ANGLES (Expanded from Basics)
A. Ascendant (ASC) - DETAILED
Location: Always in 1st house (Whole Signs)
What It Is:
* “The exact point in a constellation that was coming up on the eastern horizon the moment you took your first breath”
* Your sunrise
* Physical body, appearance, how you dress
* Soul’s earthly expression
* Self-awareness, first impressions
Whole Signs vs Placidus:
* Whole Signs: ASC “floats” anywhere within 1st house (0°-29°)

   * Example: ASC at 13° Leo = still in 1st house (Leo)
   * Allows ASC to sit at various degrees without house shift
   * Placidus: ASC = CUSP of 1st house (always 0°)

      * Half of rising sign can fall in 12th house
      * Creates confusion about self-identity
Why This Matters:
      * Person with 13° Leo ASC in Whole Signs = full Leo rising energy
      * Same person in Placidus = Leo split between 12th/1st houses (inaccurate)
________________


B. Descendant (DESC) - DETAILED
Location: Always in 7th house (exactly 180° from ASC)
What It Is:
      * “How you handle direct one-to-one influence”
      * Relationship approach
      * How others see you when you’re NOT engaged
      * Types of people you attract
Key Insight:
“For me, people see me as an Aquarius [DESC]… When you are not engaging with people, this is what people see you as.”
Shadow Qualities:
      * Traits you don’t see in yourself
      * Unrealized aspects of personality
      * Often projected onto partners
Example:
      * Leo Rising → Aquarius Descendant
      * Shadow: Doesn’t see own detachment OR own capacity for deep friendship
________________


C. IC (Imum Coeli / Nadir) - DETAILED
Location: Can be in 3rd, 4th, OR 5th house (Whole Signs only)
Placidus vs Whole Signs:
      * Placidus: IC always = start of 4th house (cusp at 0°)
      * Whole Signs: IC floats, can be in adjacent houses
What It Is:
“The point that anything that’s on it will describe the most influential, impactful types of energies that surrounded how you grew up, especially in your first five to six-ish years of your life.”
Key Themes:
      1. Childhood environment (especially ages 0-6)
      2. Innermost feelings & privacy
      3. Things you don’t share (unless people REALLY know you)
      4. Deep emotional self
      5. Repressed memories
      6. Ancestry, lineage, familial roots
      7. “Literally where you came from”
Why Ages 0-6 Matter:
      * Brain synapses not fully formed
      * Memory not solidified
      * Cognition not “full blast”
      * IC shows what shaped you before conscious memory
House Variations:
IC in 3rd House:
      * Communications in early childhood
      * Relationships with siblings/cousins
      * Mental foundation
IC in 4th House:
      * Family relationships
      * Mother specifically
      * Physical home environment
      * Traditional childhood interpretation
IC in 5th House:
      * Creativity as child
      * Recreation, fun, self-expression
      * How you played
Spiritual Uses:
      * Akashic records readings
      * Past life work
      * Uses: IC + Moon + South Node

D. MC (Midheaven / Medium Coeli) - DETAILED
Location: Can be in 9th, 10th, OR 11th house (Whole Signs only)
Placidus vs Whole Signs:
      * Placidus: MC always = start of 10th house

         * MC always = career (limited interpretation)
         * Whole Signs: MC floats across houses

            * MC = life purpose themes, NOT just career
            * 10th house = actual jobs/fields
            * MC = HOW you do them, essence you embody
Critical Distinction:
Component:
	What It Means:
	10th House
	Type of career, specific field, actual job
	Midheaven
	THEMES of how you achieve, essence to embody
	Example:
“Your 10th house rules your career, the type of jobs that you have, but the Midheaven is the essence of who you have to be in that career.”
What It Represents:
            * “Soul’s outward projection”
            * Public reputation (how world sees you)
            * Life purpose direction (not specific calling)
            * Career approach (not career itself)
House Variations:
MC in 9th House:
            * Philosophy matters
            * Opinion, seeing differently
            * Your viewpoint is your purpose
            * Teaching, travel, higher education themes
MC in 10th House:
            * Traditional career focus
            * Fame, notoriety possible
            * Public image crucial
            * Most common interpretation (but not only one)


MC in 11th House:
“Your outward purpose may have to do with just networking and doing humanitarian efforts, or working with groups”
            * Community work
            * Technology, online presence
            * Humanitarian causes
            * Group leadership
________________


E. Angles in Chart Reading
Blue Lines (Astro.com):
            * ASC & MC: Labeled with text + degree
            * DESC & IC: Only blue lines (NO TEXT)
            * DESC: 7th house blue line
            * IC: 4th house blue line (or 3rd/5th in Whole Signs)
Finding Angles Without Labels:
            * DESC = exact opposite degree of ASC
            * ASC at 13°06’ Leo → DESC at 13°06’ Aquarius
            * IC = exact opposite degree of MC
            * MC at 3° Taurus → IC at 3° Scorpio

II. RETROGRADE PLANETS IN NATAL CHART (Complete Guide)
CRITICAL DISTINCTION:
Transit Retrogrades vs Natal Retrogrades:
            * Transit: Planets going retrograde NOW (Mercury Rx = review contracts)
            * Natal: Born with planet retrograde (COMPLETELY DIFFERENT meaning)
“Natal retrogrades are different than transit retrogrades”
Sun & Moon: CANNOT be retrograde
            * Only planets can retrograde
            * Luminaries always direct
________________


🟡 MERCURY RETROGRADE (Natal)
Core Theme: Internalized mental processing
How Learning Works:
“You absorb thoughts and ideas through repetition and osmosis rather than deliberate study… if I read it in a textbook, it was terrible… I had to learn by doing charts. Do a chart, do a chart, do a chart.”
Characteristics:
1. Non-Linear Thinking:
            * “Think out of the box”
            * Abstract, quantum leaps to answers
            * Non-linear patterns
            * Arrive at correct answer via unusual routes
2. School Struggles:
“Difficult…to show their work in school, especially in math class, because they’re not doing it the way they learned it that way, but then in their mind, they’re like, there’s an easier way.”
            * Can’t show work (found own method)
            * May get right answer but “wrong” process
            * Teachers don’t understand their logic
3. Learning Style:
            * Repetition & osmosis (not study)
            * Must DO it to learn it
            * Hands-on, experiential learning
            * After doing it multiple times, “they’ve got it”


4. Mental Patterns:
            * Constantly editing, reviewing, rethinking
            * Information cycles until it “clicks”
            * Replay scenarios mentally
            * Critical thinkers (question everything - defense mechanism)
Real Example (Instructor):
            * Mercury Rx in chart
            * Terrible in Advanced Placement classes (more reading = worse)
            * Learned astrology by doing hundreds of charts
            * Teaching style reflects non-linear processing
________________


💗 VENUS RETROGRADE (Natal)
Core Theme: Internalized love, beauty, pleasure

            * Beauty standards differ from mainstream
            * Apply beauty/love differently
            * Personal aesthetics unique
2. Partnership Needs:
“The type of partnerships you have and what you need from a partnership isn’t as obvious on the outside. It’s a very internalized thing.”
            * Must communicate needs (not surface-obvious)
            * Partners may not “get it” without explanation
            * Value inward qualities over surface beauty
3. Unconventional Choices:
“Seek unconventional…styles, friends, partners…not just surface, pretty…looking for something more.”
            * Less concerned with social norms

            * Value depth over appearance
________________


♂️ MARS RETROGRADE (Natal)
Core Theme: Internalized action & anger

            * Self-improvement focus
            * Constantly one-upping self
2. Anger Issues:
“With this Retrograde, you tend to internalize your anger, and it leaks out. Instead of expressing what’s wrong, you’ll hold it in; you’ll bottle it up, and it comes out when you least expect it.”
            * Bottles anger (doesn’t express)
            * Leaks out unexpectedly
            * Must consciously work on expression
3. Where It Manifests:
“You have to look where Mars is and what house…”
            * Mars in 7th house: Takes out on partner

            * Blame others to protect self
            * Fear rejection/loss
            * Can’t admit mistakes (at first)
4. Late Bloomer:

            * Mature later than peers
            * Self-imposed restrictions
            * Growth happens slowly

            * Needs extra encouragement
            * Requires consistent validation
            * Build self-esteem early
________________


♅ URANUS RETROGRADE (Natal)

________________


♆ NEPTUNE RETROGRADE (Natal)
Core Theme: Internal confusion about virtue
“You can be confused inwardly as to whether they’re virtuous or not; you might not know if you’re a good person or not with a Neptune retrograde.”
Characteristics:
1. Virtue Confusion:
            * Don’t know if they’re “good”
            * Question morality internally

            * Champion underdogs
            * Help others constantly
3. Easily Taken Advantage Of:
“More susceptible, more easily taken advantage of by others.”
            * Can’t see manipulation
            * Trust too easily
            * Get used by others

♇ PLUTO RETROGRADE (Natal)
Core Theme: Internal transformation resistance
“Difficult time accepting transformation or fully accepting death…these are people who have issues with mortality on one rung or another.”


Characteristics:
1. Mortality Issues:
            * Can’t accept death
            * Fear transformation
            * Resist endings
2. Power Blindness:
“Question their own personal power and unaware of their effect on others.”
            * Don’t see own power
            * Unaware of impact on people
            * Underestimate influence

III. RULER SHIFTS (Bi-Directional & Layered Rulership)
A. The Two Methods
“People look, astrologers, textbooks, and whatnot; we’ll look at rulerships one way, and I do two things. One is I do what’s called a bi-directional rulership, and the other thing is I do layered rulership. And I think both of those are extremely important.”
1. Bi-Directional:
            * Forward: House sign → ruler planet
            * Reverse: Planet → houses it rules
2. Layered:
            * Follow chains multiple levels deep
            * Each layer adds context
________________


B. Forward Rulership (Standard)
Process:
            1. Find sign on house cusp
            2. Find that sign’s ruler
            3. See where ruler sits in chart
Example:
2nd house in Pisces
→ Pisces ruled by Neptune
→ Neptune in 11th house
= Make money (2nd) through groups/networking (11th)


________________


C. Reverse Rulership (Bi-Directional)
Process:
            1. Find planet in house
            2. See what house(s) that planet rules
            3. That house feeds energy INTO current placement
Example:
Mars in 2nd house
→ Mars rules Aries
→ Aries on 3rd house cusp
= Action toward money (Mars in 2nd) comes FROM communication (3rd house)
= Salesperson, writer who earns from communication


Key Quote:
“Mars is sitting in the second house of money… Mars rulership goes the other way. What is Mars the ruler of? Well, it’s the ruler of Aries… it’s in the third house. So I know that all of this energy… What are they doing? Because it’s Mars doing action. Well, it comes from the third house. Their third house always feeds into the second house themes because of the rulership.”
________________


D. Layered Rulership (Deep Chains)
Process:
            1. Do forward rulership (level 1)
            2. From where ruler lands, find THAT sign’s ruler (level 2)
            3. Repeat for multiple layers
Example:
LAYER 1:
2nd house (money) in Pisces → Neptune in 11th house


LAYER 2:
11th house in Sagittarius → Jupiter in 4th house


INTERPRETATION:
Make money (2nd) through spiritual/creative work (Pisces/Neptune)
In group settings or online (11th house)
Rooted in home/family business (Jupiter in 4th, Sag)




Quote:
“Now, when I do a second layer, I will then say, I wanna know the condition of the 11th house. So we know that the second house is sitting up here in the 11th house. How they make money is through this, but what is this? So then I go say, Sagittarius’ ruler is Jupiter, and this is the second layer, so that is sitting down here. I found it in the fourth house.”
________________


E. Ruler in Own House
What It Means:
“The ruler of the house sitting in the same house means that the focus is put back on the theme.”
Characteristics:
            * Compartmentalization (until aspects added)
            * No other life area brought into focus
            * Pure expression of that house
Example:
7th house in Capricorn, Saturn in 7th house
= Life goals (Saturn) focused on relationships (7th)
= Authority over one-to-one interactions
= Relationships ARE the career/structure


________________


F. Empty House Rulership
What To Do:
“Empty second house means I’ve got nothing to work with here. It means that money is not a main focus of life.”
Process:
            1. Find sign on empty house
            2. Find ruler
            3. Read ruler’s placement + aspects
Example:
Empty 2nd house in Aquarius
→ Uranus rules Aquarius
→ Uranus in 11th house (with MC & Juno)
= Makes money through networking, online work, partnerships
= Not main life focus, but happens through groups/tech


________________


G. Reading Order (Important!)
Zodiacal Order Matters:
“It works in order, right? So Mars comes before the sun, not the sun to Mars, even though it’s the rulership.”
Example:
            * Mars in 2nd house (Aries energy)
            * Sun in 5th house (Leo energy)
            * Mars → Sun flow (NOT Sun → Mars)
            * Action toward money (Mars 2nd) informs creative expression (Sun 5th)
________________


IV. ORBS OF INFLUENCE (Exact Values)
A. Why Orbs Matter
“Orbs of influence is one of the most important things, in my opinion, when it comes to actually reading a chart.”
What They Do:
            * Determine if planets actually aspect
            * Define reach of energy
            * Distinguish stellium from satellitium
________________


B. Exact Orb Values
Natal & Transit (Same Values):

________________


C. How Orbs Work (Visual)
Overlapping Orbs:
Planet A: ●━━━━━━━━► (orb reaches this far)
Planet B:     ◄━━━━━━━━● (orb reaches this far)
         [MUTUAL INFLUENCE ZONE]


Quote:
“If Saturn’s orb of influence is here and it’s reaching Mercury, and Mercury’s is here, then this is Saturn without Mercury. And then this is Saturn with Mercury. Both of them are influenced in this area.”
Key Insight:
            * Saturn may influence Mercury before Mercury influences Saturn
            * Depends on who’s applying (moving toward aspect)
            * Faster planet catches up to slower planet
________________


D. Degree & Minute Notation
Critical for Accuracy:
“This is basically six degrees, not five. If you read it as five, you could be a little off in some of your calculations, but it’s six degrees. 15°32’ is basically 15 and a half degrees.”
Rounding Rules:
            * 0°-29’ = round down (e.g., 5°29’ = 5°)
            * 30’-59’ = round up (e.g., 5°30’ = 6°)
Why It Matters:
            * 1° difference can mean aspect exists or doesn’t
            * Minutes determine exactness
            * Applying vs separating determined by minutes
________________


E. Stellium vs Satellitium
STELLIUM:
            * 3+ planets in same sign
            * ALL within mutual orb of influence
            * Planets affect each other
            * Energies blend/fuse
SATELLITIUM:
“A satellitium is a cluster of planets within the same sign that do not impact each other.”
            * 3+ planets in same sign
            * OUTSIDE mutual orb influence
            * Act independently
            * Same house, separate functions
Real Example (Instructor’s Chart):
3rd House: Mars (4°), Saturn (15°), Pluto (24°)


Check orbs:
- Mars orb: 3-4° → reaches 7-8°
- Saturn orb: 7-8° → reaches 7-23°
- Pluto orb: 2-3° → reaches 21-27°


Result: NONE reach each other = SATELLITIUM


Quote:
“You’ll notice none of these planets are within an orb of influence… These are called a satellitium because Mars is four degrees, we’ll put it at nine; Saturn’s 15 plus seven or minus seven…Pluto, being two to three degrees, definitely doesn’t reach any of them.”
________________


V. DECANS (Subdivisions)
A. Structure
“Every zodiac sign is comprised of 30 degrees…each decan is a 10 degree subdivision within a sign.”


Three Decans per Sign:
            * 1st Decan: 0°-9° (ruled by sign itself)
            * 2nd Decan: 10°-19° (next sign of same element)
            * 3rd Decan: 20°-29° (third sign of same element)
________________


B. Example - Pisces
Pisces 1st Decan (0°-9°): Pisces-Pisces (Neptune flavor)
Pisces 2nd Decan (10°-19°): Pisces-Cancer (Moon flavor)
Pisces 3rd Decan (20°-29°): Pisces-Scorpio (Pluto flavor)


Sequence: Water signs in order (Pisces → Cancer → Scorpio)
________________


C. Purpose
“If you have a planet in Aries, you’re still reading Aries energy. But if you want more detail, then you go into the Deccan just to highlight what flavor of Aries are we talking about.”
What Decans Do:
            * Add flavor/nuance
            * Don’t change core sign
            * Explain differences between same-sign placements
What Decans DON’T Do:
“Does the rulership Deccan planets, Sun and Mars have more weight? No, the Deccans don’t add weight. The Deccans are only a flavor here.”
            * Don’t override house ruler
            * Don’t add “extra” ruling planet
            * Only for interpretation depth
________________


D. Traditional vs Chaldean
Use: Traditional Decans (astro.com setting)
            * Based on element sequences
            * Supported by this system
Don’t Use: Chaldean Decans
            * Different calculation
            * “Don’t play out” according to instructor
________________


VI. APPLYING & SEPARATING
A. Definitions
Applying:
“As transits are coming up, as it’s coming up here, it’s called applying, meaning this planet is applying its energy onto Saturn, or I’m sorry, onto Jupiter.”
            * Faster planet approaching aspect
            * Energy building
            * Effect strengthening
Separating:
“And as it passes forward, it is separating, meaning it’s losing its influence.”
            * Faster planet moving past aspect
            * Energy waning
            * Effect weakening
Exact/Direct:
            * Planets at exact degree
            * Peak energy
            * Strongest effect
________________


B. In Aspect Grids
How to Read:
“Negative five, and then separating. So the faster planet is leaving, is already past the slower planet.”
            * Number = orb (degrees apart)
            * Positive number = applying
            * Negative number = separating
            * “Separating” text confirms
________________


VII. CALCULATION METHODS
A. Software Usage
Recommended: Astro.com with specific settings
            * Whole Sign houses (mandatory)
            * Traditional Decans activated
            * Geocentric (Earth-based)
            * Tropical zodiac
________________


B. Reading Degrees
Notation:
            * First number(s) = degrees
            * Last two digits = minutes (out of 60)
            * Examples:
            * 13°06’ = 13 degrees, 6 minutes
            * 25°57’ = 25 degrees, 57 minutes
________________


C. Calculating Orbs
Process:
            1. Find planet A degree
            2. Find planet B degree
            3. Calculate difference: |A - B|
            4. Check both planets’ orbs
            5. If BOTH orbs reach, aspect exists
Example:
Mercury at 6°41'
Saturn at 15°32'
Difference: 15.53 - 6.68 = ~9°


Mercury orb: 2-3° (reaches to ~9°)
Saturn orb: 7-8° (reaches to ~8°)


Result: NO ASPECT (Saturn can't reach Mercury)

VIII. INTERPRETATION FRAMEWORKS
A. Systematic Approach
Order:
            1. Understand basics (houses, signs, planets)
            2. Use Whole Signs
            3. Identify angles (ASC, DESC, IC, MC)
            4. Find house rulers (forward)
            5. Trace reverse rulers (bi-directional)
            6. Add layers (deep chains)
            7. Check planets in houses
            8. Evaluate orbs (stellium vs satellitium)
            9. Analyze aspects
            10. Add decans for flavor
            11. Consider retrogrades
            12. Synthesize answer
________________


B. The Lens Concept
“A lens is the topic that we’re talking about. So when I’m looking at Mars, I’m not talking about romance, so I don’t need to know that Mars has to do with sex. I need to know that it has to do with passion and drive, not romantic passion, because we’re talking about money.”
Key Principle:
            * Don’t read ALL keywords for planet
            * Filter by topic (lens)
            * Mars in 2nd house:
            * ✓ Action, drive, passion toward money
            * ✗ Sex, aggression (wrong lens)
________________


C. Avoiding Overwhelm
“When you guys are doing these charts, do not get overwhelmed by all of this information. This is everything, and you never look at everything to do things. You don’t look at every single aspect, every single placement, everything. You have to look at what’s the question…”
Strategy:
            * Start with client’s question
            * Find relevant houses
            * Trace rulers/aspects only for that area
            * Don’t analyze entire chart at once
________________


D. Apps & Horoscopes
“Those are thematic. They’re not specific to you. So, while if they’re done properly, they’re not wrong. They’re not bad. They’re just not personalized. And this is why you wanna learn astrology for yourself.”
Why Generic Readings Fail:
            * No aspects factored in
            * No house rulers
            * No orbs checked
            * Assumes planets act alone

Whole Signs vs Placidus:
Planet
	Whole Signs
	Placidus
	Reality Check
	Mercury
	11th house
	10th house
	Humanitarian tech (11th) ✓ vs Career focus (10th) ✗
	Uranus
	5th house
	4th house
	Video games (5th fun) ✓ vs Childhood home (4th) ✗
	Jupiter
	4th house
	3rd house
	Both work (orb spills into 3rd)
	Video Game Example:
“Childhood had a lot of video games… video games were a staple; I’m not joking about that. It’s not just like I played video games. No, that was my life.”
Whole Signs:
            * 5th house (fun/recreation) ✓
            * Sagittarius (exploration) ✓
            * Neptune (media) ✓
            * Uranus (electronics/technology) ✓
= Perfect match
Placidus:
               * Uranus in 4th (childhood/home)
               * Far from 5th house cusp
               * Would need 2 house stretch
= Doesn’t match
________________


B. Random Chart Examples
Example 1: Aquarius Rising (Money)
Setup:
                  * 2nd house: Pisces (Mars inside)
                  * Neptune (Pisces ruler): 11th house Sagittarius
                  * Jupiter (Sag ruler): 4th house
Forward Rulership:
2nd house → Pisces → Neptune in 11th
= Makes money through groups, networking, online


Layered Rulership:
11th house → Sagittarius → Jupiter in 4th
= Group work rooted in home/family business


Reverse Rulership:
Mars in 2nd → rules Aries → Aries on 3rd house
= Action toward money comes from communication
= Sales, marketing, writing


Synthesis:
                  * Spiritual or creative work (Pisces)
                  * Through groups or online (11th)
                  * Based from home (Jupiter 4th)
                  * Using communication skills (Mars rules 3rd)
                  * Possibly: Online spiritual teacher, group therapy from home, food blog
________________


Example 2: Empty 2nd House
Setup:
                  * Empty 2nd house in Aquarius
                  * Uranus (ruler): 11th house
                  * MC & Juno also in 11th
Interpretation:
“Empty second house means I’ve got nothing to work with here. It means that money is not a main focus of life… So this person makes money through networking, through friends, through online tech and humanitarian efforts. Its ruler is Uranus…Midheaven is there, Juno’s there; so they work with a partner.”
Result:
                  * Money not main focus
                  * Earns through: networking, tech, groups
                  * Partners in work (Juno conjunct MC)
                  * Possible fields: Group therapy, online collaboration
________________


C. Client Q&A Example
Question: “How do you know they like spicy food but can’t have it?”
Method:
                  1. Find food houses (2nd, 6th)
                  2. Check signs (Aries = spicy)
                  3. Check aspects (Chiron = can’t have)
                  4. Trace rulers
                  5. Use decans for flavor
Result:
                  * Aries on food axis = spicy preference
                  * Chiron aspect = health restriction
                  * Can’t eat what they love
________________


X. TERMINOLOGY GLOSSARY
Angles: ASC, DESC, IC, MC (4 major chart points)
Applying Aspect: Faster planet approaching exact aspect (energy building)
Bi-Directional Rulership: Forward (sign→ruler) + Reverse (planet→houses it rules)
Compartmentalization: Ruler in own house (focused, not spreading)
Decan: 10° subdivision of sign (3 per sign for flavor)
Exact/Direct Aspect: Planets at same degree (peak energy)
Layered Rulership: Following ruler chains multiple levels deep
Lens: Topic/question filtering interpretation (don’t read all keywords)
Orb of Influence: How far planet’s energy reaches (varies by planet)
Satellitium: 3+ planets same sign, OUTSIDE mutual orbs (act independently)
Separating Aspect: Faster planet moving past exact aspect (energy waning)
Stellium: 3+ planets same sign, WITHIN mutual orbs (blend energies)

XII. KEY QUOTES FOR APP UI
On Orbs:
“Orbs of influence is one of the most important things, in my opinion, when it comes to actually reading a chart.”
On Bi-Directional Rulership:
“I do two things. One is I do what’s called a bi-directional rulership, and the other thing is I do layered rulership. And I think both of those are extremely important.”
On Not Overwhelming:
“Do not get overwhelmed by all of this information… You have to look at what’s the question.”
On Apps/Horoscopes:
“They’re just not personalized. And this is why you wanna learn astrology for yourself.”

📚 TRANSCRIPT 3: “CORE COMPONENTS - ASPECTS & TRANSITS”
THE GLUE OF ASTROLOGY
________________


I. ASPECTS - FOUNDATIONAL CONCEPTS
A. What Are Aspects?
Definition:
“Aspects are the glue to astrology… aspects are the relationships between planets.”
Why They Matter:
“If you’re looking at somebody’s sun sign, and you read the definition of the sun sign, for me, it’s the sun in Gemini… by definition and by most websites, we would be the same person in terms of our personality, our creative expression, and how we view children and how they manifest in our life. But my sun is aspecting all kinds of other planets.”
Core Principle:
                  * Same planet + same sign ≠ same person
                  * Aspects create uniqueness
                  * Must factor in ALL relationships to understand true nature
________________


B. How to Identify Aspects
Visual Method (Chart Wheel):
“Now I don’t tend to look too much at these lines because they start becoming this ball of yarn, and it just becomes too much for me.”
                  * Lines in chart = potential aspects
                  * WARNING: Lines can be inaccurate (software uses wrong orbs)
                  * Must verify with degrees
Degree Method (Preferred):
“I personally pay attention to the numbers here. And this is where the degrees… matter so much.”
Quick Check:
                  * Same degree number = likely aspect
                  * Example: 13° and 13° = exactly 30° apart (one house = 30°)
                  * Example: 14° and 13° = close, check orbs
________________


C. Reading the Aspect Grid
Structure:
“The way that this one is laid out is that the planets kind of go diagonally down. And this is when you look at the boxes. Anywhere there is a glyph in here… that means there is a relationship or an aspect to the other planet.”
What Grid Shows:
                  * Glyph symbol = aspect type
                  * Number = orb (degrees apart)
                  * Positive = applying
                  * Negative = separating
                  * Text = “applying” or “separating”
Example from Instructor’s Chart:
“My sun and my moon have a relationship, and the other information here talks about applying versus separating… it tells you up here, negative five, and then separating. So the faster planet is leaving, is already past the slower planet.”
________________


D. Order of Aspect Reading
Instructor’s Method:
“I always look at [aspects] in that order because I want to know what I’m dealing with. And I don’t make any snap judgments until I’ve looked at all of them.”
Priority Order:
                  1. Conjunctions (0°) - “first thing I look for”
                  2. Oppositions (180°)
                  3. Squares (90°)
                  4. Trines (120°)
                  5. Minor aspects (sextile, semi-sextile, etc.)
Why This Order:
                  * Conjunctions = power/fusion (starting point)
                  * Oppositions = awareness (easiest to balance)
                  * Squares = conflict/growth (hardest to master)
                  * Trines = harmony (can create laziness)
                  * Minor = nuance (add after understanding major)
________________


E. Zodiacal Directional Order
CRITICAL RULE:
“It always goes in the direction of the chronological succession of the signs, meaning if I’m looking at the moon and the sun… I look at the moon first, and it informs the sun.”
How It Works:
Aries → Taurus → Gemini → Cancer → Leo → Virgo 
→ Libra → Scorpio → Sagittarius → Capricorn → Aquarius → Pisces


Example:
Moon in Aquarius (25°) 
Sun in Gemini (21°)


Reading order: Moon → Sun
(Aquarius comes BEFORE Gemini in zodiac wheel when going forward)


Interpretation: Moon INFORMS Sun (emotions shape creative expression)


Why It Matters:
                  * Shows energy flow direction
                  * First planet = influences second
                  * NOT bidirectional (one-way street)
                  * Changes interpretation significantly
Counterexample:
If Sun were in Aquarius and Moon in Gemini:
Sun → Moon
Creative expression shapes emotional reactions
(Completely different dynamic)


________________


II. MAJOR ASPECTS (The Big 4)
🔵 1. CONJUNCTION (0°)
Definition:
“Conjunction is full orb of influence; it’s zero degrees apart, is direct. So a planet at 14 degrees, another planet at 14 degrees, that is a direct conjunction or an exact conjunction.”
________________


A. Orb Range
Uses FULL orb of each planet:
                  * Sun conjunct Moon: Use Sun’s orb (8-10°) + Moon’s orb (2-3°)
                  * Saturn conjunct Mercury: Saturn (7-8°) + Mercury (2-3°)
                  * Widest orb of any aspect
Example:
Planet A at 5°
Planet B at 12° (7° apart)


If Planet A orb = 7-8° (Saturn)
And Planet B orb = 2-3° (Moon)


Result: Conjunction EXISTS (Saturn reaches, Moon barely within)


________________


B. Key Meanings
Keyword: POWER
“The key word for conjunction is power, because you’re adding two planets together at the same space at the same time. So, it’s power, it’s focus, it’s a lot of harnessed energy in one point.”
Characteristics:
                  * Fusion of energies
                  * Concentrated force
                  * Both planets operate AS ONE
                  * Cannot separate them in interpretation
________________


C. Positive vs Negative
Not Always Positive:
“A lot of people think that conjunctions are easy, that they’re always positive, and that’s not true. Sometimes, you can have a planet, and it will oscillate; it’ll go back and forth. Sometimes one planet will be stronger than the other planet and try to take over in certain situations.”
Challenge:
                  * Planets compete for dominance
                  * One can overshadow other
                  * Must consciously balance both
When It Works:
                  * Intentional blending
                  * Recognizing both energies
                  * Using as unified force
________________


D. Examples
Instructor’s Chart:
“Vesta is an asteroid… It’s at 23 degrees, 50 minutes, two degrees away from my moon, 25:57. Literally, my eternal flame and my emotions have to go together. I’m a very highly sensitive, highly emotional person, and I utilize this energy and this energy. When I’m good, it lights up. I light up. When I’m not in a good place, I can kick myself back into it if I remember my passions, my drive.”
Vesta ☌ Moon (Aquarius, 7th house):
                  * Eternal flame (Vesta) + emotions (Moon) = ONE thing
                  * Can’t separate passion from feelings
                  * When down, access passion to lift emotions
                  * In relationships (7th), emotional devotion inseparable
________________


E. Special Case: New Moon
Astrological Definition:
“A new moon is a conjunction. So when people ask me about the new moon and new moon energies, I always go back to the astrological definition of what a new moon is… a new moon is the sun conjunct the moon; the moon and the sun are working together.”
Why New Moons = Manifestation:
“This is why there’s manifestation, because your emotions and the phase of the moon specifically, and the sun are working together. The sun is not reflecting off of the moon at that point… the moon is not as powerful as it is in a full moon. So this is why you can manifest, because you’re emotionally clear at that point and you’re aligning your emotions with your personality, your drive, the things that you want for the future and sparking that interest.”
New Moon Mechanics:
                  * Sun ☌ Moon = unified purpose
                  * Emotions (Moon) + will (Sun) aligned
                  * No reflection = no distraction
                  * Clear emotional slate
                  * Perfect for setting intentions
________________


F. Stellium (Conjunction Clusters)
Definition:
“When people talk about stelliums, that’s a cluster of conjunctions basically. It’s three or more planets in the same sign within the orb of influence of each other.”
Requirements:
                  * 3+ planets minimum
                  * Same sign
                  * All within mutual orbs
vs Satellitium (covered later)
________________


🔴 2. OPPOSITION (180°)
Definition: Two planets exactly opposite (across the chart)
________________


A. Key Meanings
Keyword: AWARENESS
“Oppositions have to do with awareness. They have to do with when one is… one planet is playing tug of war with another planet.”
Characteristics:
                  * Tug of war between energies
                  * Must balance both sides
                  * Pendulum effect (swing too far either way)
                  * Compromise required
________________


B. How It Works
The Pendulum:
“If you go too far one way, the other planet feels left out… if you go the other way, it’s like the pendulum swinging; you become too involved in extremes.”
The Balance:
“Sometimes, you can even try really hard to justify or work with one planet, and if you use it positively, you can pull energy from the other planet fairly easily by creating a compromise.”
Pattern:
Planet A ←───[compromise zone]───→ Planet B
   ↓                                    ↓
Extreme A                           Extreme B
   ↓                                    ↓
Neglect B                           Neglect A


Solution: Stay in compromise zone, honor BOTH


________________


C. Reading Oppositions
Direction Matters:
“Remember, we were talking about the sun… the sun in Gemini is all about… creative expression through writing, creative expression through communication… But then you have to bring in Neptune, and Neptune will always be a part of this.”
Order (Zodiacal):
                  * Identify which planet comes first in zodiac order
                  * That planet INFORMS the other
                  * Both active, but flow is directional
Example from Instructor:
Sun in Gemini (21°) ☍ Neptune in Sagittarius (25°)


Zodiac order: Gemini → Sagittarius
Flow: Sun → Neptune


Interpretation:
Creative expression (Sun Gemini) is INFORMED BY spirituality/illusion (Neptune Sag)
Must express (Sun) WITH awareness of spiritual/emotional depth (Neptune)


________________


D. Examples
Instructor’s Sun ☍ Neptune:
“This is what makes me a compassionate person; it is what makes me a kind person; it’s what makes me a spiritual person and very intuitive, but it also can work in the negative ways.”
Positive Manifestations:
                  * Compassionate
                  * Kind
                  * Spiritual
                  * Intuitive
                  * Creative (music, media)
Negative Manifestations:
“Sometimes, this becomes massive depression, and that has played out in my life quite a bit, because what ends up happening is, when my fire, my sun, my light is dim, let’s say, in the last couple of years when everything was closed down… it ends up dimming this down, and then I revert over to here, which is illusion, loss, feeling like everything’s gone, disappeared… I start losing purpose.”
The Tug of War:
                  * Sun side: Creative expression, social interaction (11th house)
                  * Neptune side: Spiritual isolation, illusion, loss
                  * When Sun dims → Neptune takes over (depression)
                  * When Neptune overwhelms → can’t express Sun (stagnation)
Resolution:
“I had to find a way to connect with 11th house friends and communicate with friends, especially with Mercury also in there, and focus on my hopes and dreams, and ignore the rest. I had to physically choose what energies I wanted to use and in what way.”
________________


E. Opposites Attract
Relationship Principle:
“This is marriage; this is opposites attract. When I was talking in the first class about the houses, and how the first house and the seventh house, the first house is the house of self, the seventh house is the house of you and others, or partnership. If you spend too much time on you, you lose out on partners; if you spend too much time on partners, you lose out on you. Compromise is you being able to be independent within your partnership.”
Synastry Application:
                  * People attract opposite energies
                  * Example: Mars in Taurus ← attracted to → Mars/Venus/Pluto in Scorpio
                  * “Grass is greener” effect
                  * Can’t live in neighbor’s yard (must balance)
________________


F. Working With Opposition
Student Question:
“And your Neptune affects your sun, so when balancing this tug of war, you assess how Neptune can influence your sun more positively, correct?”
Answer:
“What are the positive aspects of Neptune? How can I not feel illusion, depression, the loss of everything? What are the higher vibrations? Spirituality.”
Process:
                  1. Identify lower vibration of challenging planet
                  2. Find higher vibration alternatives
                  3. Consciously choose higher expression
                  4. Honor BOTH planets (don’t suppress either)
Instructor’s Example:
                  * Lower Neptune: Depression, illusion, loss
                  * Higher Neptune: Spirituality, intuition, compassion
                  * Solution: Dive into astrology, tarot (spiritual pursuits)
                  * Used Neptune positively while maintaining Sun expression

🟥 3. SQUARE (90°)
Definition: Two planets at 90° angle (3 houses apart)
________________


A. Key Meanings
Keyword: CONFLICT
“Squares have such a bad rap… Squares represent conflict. And you know the thing about conflict is there’s usually resolution, or there can be resolution.”
Characteristics:
                  * Friction between energies
                  * Internal challenge
                  * Both planets want dominance
                  * Requires active resolution
________________


B. Why Squares Get Bad Reputation
The Problem:
“The difficulty can be very high because it can be very difficult to take these two energies and find a way to fuse them together in a way that both planets are appeased. And that’s the key, is that in a square you cannot leave one out.”
vs Opposition:
                  * Opposition: Can focus on one, pull from other (compromise)
                  * Square: MUST appease BOTH equally (no compromise option)
The Challenge:
“In a square you can’t [leave one out]. One planet needs to be appeased with the other, and there’s very little compromise when you do this.”
________________


C. The Power of Squares
Achievement Through Conflict:
“It’s always considered negative by almost every single astrologer and astrology resource, yet without squares, progress through action would not exist… You need squares. Somebody without squares in their chart may never accomplish anything in their life.”
Why Squares Create Success:
                  * Friction = motivation
                  * Conflict = forced resolution
                  * Challenge = growth
                  * Mastery = power
The Paradox:
“People who do amazing things in this world tend to have a lot of squares in their chart or specifically within powerful planets.”
________________


D. Trines vs Squares
Trines (Easy):
“The ones that seem good tends to make a lazy person, like trines tend to make a lazy person… that’s harmonious flow.”
                  * Natural flow
                  * No effort needed
                  * Can lead to complacency
                  * “Good enough” syndrome
Squares (Hard):
“The ones that conflict, once you master them, tend to really elevate you, and like you skip steps and you level up and level up and level up.”
                  * Requires effort
                  * Forces mastery
                  * Skip growth stages
                  * Rapid elevation
Sports Metaphor:
“Could you imagine what sports would be without conflict, without competition? There would be no sport; there would be no winner; there’d be no loser; there’d be nothing. There would just be a bunch of people just passing the ball around; that’d be practice.”
________________


E. How to Work With Squares
Bending Energy:
“It requires compromise only in the sense of blending, I’m sorry, bending the energy to create a situation which both energies are happy.”
NOT Compromise:
                  * Don’t meet in middle
                  * Don’t sacrifice one for other
                  * Don’t alternate focus
IS Bending:
                  * Find expression that satisfies BOTH
                  * Creative solutions
                  * Higher vibrations of each planet
                  * Simultaneous expression
________________


F. Examples
Instructor’s Saturn ☐ Sun:
“Saturn is father time; Saturn does create opportunity when you slow down. And when it’s square your Sun, often you want it now. The Sun wants to shine; the Sun wants to have fun. Saturn says, I want structure, and I want to be serious and have responsibility.”
The Conflict:
                  * Sun: Shine NOW, have fun, be creative
                  * Saturn: Structure, responsibility, wait
Lower Manifestation:
                  * Oscillation (sometimes responsible, sometimes not)
                  * Guilt when having fun
                  * Resentment when working
                  * Never satisfied
Higher Manifestation:
                  * Find work that’s fun (creative structure)
                  * Responsibility in creative expression
                  * Structured fun (scheduled creative time)
                  * Both energies honored simultaneously
Warning on Oscillation:
“Oscillation you have to do very carefully because you have to bring the other one back in pretty quickly.”
                  * Can’t ignore one for long
                  * Must return to balance rapidly
                  * Otherwise builds pressure
________________


G. Instructor’s Ascendant ☐ Venus
Setup:
                  * ASC at 13°06’ Leo
                  * Venus at 14°47’ Taurus
                  * Square by degree (same number)
Interpretation:
                  * How I present (ASC Leo) squares what I value (Venus Taurus)
                  * Appearance vs values in conflict
                  * Must show beauty while being grounded
                  * Leadership (Leo) vs stability (Taurus)
________________


H. Modality vs Degree
Traditional Teaching:
“When you read up on definitions, you’ll constantly see that a square is that a trine is the same element. Trines do not have to be the same element… They could be two completely different elements.”
Example Debunking Traditional:
Sun at 28° Gemini (Air)
North Node at 1° Libra (Air)


Traditional: "Same element = trine"
Reality: 28° to 1° = 3° difference = 1 house apart = SQUARE


Why? Count houses:
Gemini → Cancer (1) → Leo (2) → Virgo (3) → Libra
3 houses = 90° = SQUARE (not trine)


Instructor’s Point:
“This is why the degrees matter; the elements do not. When you factor in and really kind of get into breaking down the square itself, you will use the modality; you will use the element to describe how to move forward with something. But telling you that it has to be, like I said, the same modality and different element is just simply not true.”
Rule: Aspects determined by DEGREES, not elements
________________


🟢 4. TRINE (120°)
Definition: Two planets at 120° angle (4 houses apart)
________________


A. Key Meanings
Keyword: HARMONIOUS FLOW / GIFT
“The trine, this is one that people go gaga over, right? Everyone’s like, oh, it’s beautiful. It’s harmonious.”
Characteristics:
                  * Natural flow
                  * Effortless connection
                  * Gift/talent
                  * Automatic inclusion (no choice)
________________


B. The Problem With Trines
Taken for Granted:
“Grand trines or trines in general are often taken for granted.”
Why Trines Can Be Negative:
                  * So easy you don’t develop skill
                  * No effort = no mastery
                  * Complacency
                  * “Good enough” plateau
The Trap:
                  * Have talent but never practice
                  * Natural ability but no discipline
                  * Potential without achievement
________________


C. Automatic Inclusion
Can’t Turn Off:
“Automatic inclusion: […] These two planets are linked. And yes, it’s a harmonious flow, but it is unrestricted, and there’s nothing you can do about it.”
What This Means:
                  * Trine ALWAYS active
                  * Can’t choose when it operates
                  * Affects connected planets without permission
                  * Must be aware of ripple effects
________________


D. Examples
Instructor’s Grand Trine:
“My Sun and Moon are also trine, and so is Pluto and my Sun.”
Configuration:
                  * Sun in Gemini (21°) △ Moon in Aquarius (25°) △ Pluto in Libra (24°)
                  * All Air signs
                  * Forms Grand Trine (triangle)
How It Works:
“If you have Saturn over your moon, right? So Saturn is transiting my moon and it’s direct right now… But it also impacted, without my say, my son. When I felt down, I felt really down. My son was down as well, meaning I felt like I was, my light had been dimmed. And then on top of that, it’s also with Pluto, so I have this grand trine here.”
Automatic Inclusion Example:
                  * Transit hits Moon
                  * Automatically affects Sun (via trine)
                  * Automatically affects Pluto (via trine)
                  * All three activated whether you want it or not
Real Impact:
                  * Moon down → Sun dims (creative expression suffers)
                  * Sun dims → Pluto activated (transformation/depth/depression)
                  * Can’t isolate just Moon
                  * Entire grand trine participates
________________


E. Trine Flow Direction
Still Has Order:
                  * Earlier planet → Later planet (zodiacal order)
                  * But flow is effortless (unlike square’s friction)
Example:
Moon in Aquarius △ Sun in Gemini


Flow: Moon → Sun (Aquarius before Gemini)
Emotional state naturally informs creative expression
No effort needed, happens automatically


________________


F. When Trine Helps
Positive Scenarios:
                  * Need natural talent
                  * Want ease in area
                  * Connecting related themes
                  * Support between planets
When To Be Cautious:
                  * Relying on talent alone
                  * Not developing skill
                  * Taking for granted
                  * Expecting it to “just work”

III. MINOR ASPECTS
A. Why “Minor” Is Misleading
“And now I’m gonna get into what they call minor aspects. Minor aspects, I don’t like the term minor aspects, just because it kind of diminishes what they mean. It feels like they’re unimportant. They are important; they’re just not as influential, imminently influential, as the other four.”
Characteristics:
                  * Tight orbs (1-2°, max 3°)
                  * More subtle than major aspects
                  * Often overlooked
                  * Critically important for nuance
________________


🔵 5. SEXTILE (60°)
Definition: Two planets at 60° angle (2 houses apart)
________________


A. The Misconception
“When you read sextile in most sources, they always say it’s a minor version of the trine, and it is not. It is not a minor version of the trine.”
Traditional (Wrong):
                  * “Minor trine”
                  * Always positive
                  * Harmonious like trine
Reality (Correct):
                  * Opportunity (not automatic)
                  * Choice required
                  * Can be positive OR negative
________________


B. Key Difference from Trine
Trine:
“The trine is an always on connection.”
                  * Automatic
                  * No choice
                  * Always active
Sextile:
“The sextile is not; the sextile is up to you… When it’s direct at 60 degrees apart, it’s an opportunity; you can use it, which is why I like it so much.”
                  * Must activate
                  * Your choice
                  * Potential energy
________________


C. How Sextile Works
Potential vs Kinetic:
“It’s potential energy without kinetic sometimes… It’s a hidden talent. It gives you the opportunity to evolve something you’re doing.”
Metaphor:
                  * Light switch on wall
                  * Power available
                  * Must flip switch to activate
                  * Won’t turn on by itself
________________


D. Why Instructor Loves Sextiles
“I think this one is very interesting because sextiles are extremely underrated.”
Benefits:
                  * Full control (unlike trine)
                  * Can activate when needed
                  * Hidden talents
                  * Evolutionary opportunities
                  * Not forced (unlike square)
________________


E. Examples
Instructor’s Mars ⚹ Uranus:
“Mars and Uranus, that’s a sextile. I can choose to use Uranus; my Mars is in my third house. When it comes to communication, I can choose to speak faster, and sometimes I do.”
Setup:
                  * Mars in 3rd house (communication)
                  * Uranus = speed, innovation, technology
                  * Sextile = opportunity
Activation:
                  * When activated: Speaks faster, innovative communication
                  * When not activated: Normal communication pace
                  * Choice: Can turn on/off as needed
Application:
                  * Teaching: Can speed up when needed
                  * Explaining: Can slow down for clarity
                  * Full control over expression
________________


F. Sextile Can Be Negative
“It is harmonious… but it is sometimes a negative. And that’s important to know as well that sextiles, just because they’re harmonious, are different from trines. Trines are always on; that can create negativity.”
When Negative:
                  * Don’t recognize opportunity
                  * Fail to activate talent
                  * Miss potential
                  * Ignore available resource
vs Trine Negative:
                  * Trine = forced participation (no choice)
                  * Sextile = missed opportunity (had choice, didn’t use)
________________


G. Orb
Tight Orb:
“The minor aspects, which are like the 30 degrees, 60 degrees, 150 degrees, they’re one to two degree orbs of influence.”
                  * 1-2° orb (sometimes 3°)
                  * Must be close to degree
                  * Exact = strongest
________________


🟡 6. SEMI-SEXTILE (30°)
Definition: Two planets at 30° angle (1 house apart)
________________


A. Key Meanings
Keyword: AGITATION
“A semi-sextile at 30 degrees, one house over is an agitation. It’s very rarely, although sometimes mildly positive; it is almost always an agitation. It is minor discord.”
Characteristics:
                  * Irritation between energies
                  * “Oil and water won’t mix”
                  * Minor discord
                  * Friction (less than square)
________________


B. Tight Orb
“It’s a very tight orb of influence on this one, within a degree to two degrees.”
                  * 1-2° maximum
                  * Must be exact
                  * Easy to miss
________________


C. Directional Reading
Critical Rule:
“The second one is usually the issue; when you do the first one, it affects the second one.”
Process:
                  1. Identify which planet comes first (zodiacal order)
                  2. First planet = what you’re doing
                  3. Second planet = what’s being agitated
                  4. Work backwards: Appease second planet FIRST
________________


D. Example
Instructor’s North Node ⚺ Ascendant:
Setup:
                  * North Node: 13°28’ Cancer (12th house)
                  * Ascendant: 13°06’ Leo (1st house)
                  * Semi-sextile (1° orb - exact!)
Order:
                  * Cancer (North Node) comes before Leo (ASC) in zodiac
                  * North Node = first planet
                  * Ascendant = second planet (being agitated)
Interpretation:
“When I go for my North Node, which again is like life purpose in the 12th house, it’s like spiritual empathy for older people, empathy for families, spiritual nurturing, things like that, especially through transformation and the occult, and things like that… And realizing that sometimes, things that are very close to my heart have to die off in order for me to evolve. That’s been very difficult for me, and it creates an agitation because it affects my Ascendant.”
The Agitation:
                  * North Node (soul purpose): Spiritual nurturing, letting go
                  * Ascendant (self-presentation): How I show up
                  * Problem: Pursuing soul purpose agitates how I present myself
                  * Must transform self (ASC) to fulfill purpose (North Node)
                  * Creates friction in identity
Resolution Method:
“I work first with the second one to know what needs to be appeased so that when I work with the first one, I can then factor that in.”
Process:
                  1. Understand Ascendant needs (Leo = shine, be seen)
                  2. Then pursue North Node (spiritual depth)
                  3. Do North Node work IN A WAY that doesn’t agitate ASC
                  4. Example: Teach spirituality publicly (satisfies both)
________________


E. Application
Student Note:
“You’re a trailblazer teacher. I have to be, and I hope that it comes out that way.”
                  * Must blaze trail (North Node)
                  * While maintaining presence (ASC)
                  * Semi-sextile creates tension
                  * Resolution = teaching (satisfies both)
________________


🟠 7. SEMI-SQUARE (45°)
Definition: Two planets at 45° angle (1.5 houses apart)
________________


A. Instructor’s Usage
“Semi-square, I don’t use this one as much. I look at it; this is not included on this little diagram here, I look at it, I don’t pay too much mind to it.”
Why Less Focus:
                  * Less common
                  * Subtler than other aspects
                  * Still notes it but doesn’t prioritize
________________


B. Key Meanings
Keyword: MINOR CONFLICT / FRUSTRATION
“Minor conflict, 45 degrees. When it’s actively utilized, you can make severe progress and alleviate the agitation or the frustration that’s going on and creates external events as a result of the inability to naturally fuse these energies together.”
Characteristics:
                  * Frustration (internal AND external)
                  * Minor conflict
                  * Can lead to progress when worked with
                  * Creates external events if not resolved
________________


C. Semi-Square vs Square
Key Difference:
“The semi-square can be internal, like frustrating other people, but also internal, like having personal frustration. So it is personal. This is where the square and the semi-square are very different: the square is internal. It is you; it’s within you… The semi-square creates that same frustration, agitation, but it’s external; it’s outwardly presented.”
Aspect
	Location
	Nature
	Square
	Internal
	You vs You (must blend both inside)
	Semi-Square
	External
	You vs Others (frustration shows outwardly)
	________________


D. Example
Instructor’s Saturn ⚼ Uranus:
“I have a semi-square here between, in my chart, between Saturn and Uranus; it has to do with my career and online. There’s agitation, trying to have authority because my Saturn’s in the third house. Authority through my communication can be very agitating to my online presence, and I’ve seen that play out.”
Setup:
                  * Saturn in 3rd house (authority in communication)
                  * Uranus in 5th house (innovation, online, rebellion)
                  * Semi-square = external frustration
Manifestation:
                  * Trying to have authority (Saturn 3rd)
                  * Agitates online presence (Uranus)
                  * Creates friction with audience
                  * External reaction (others push back)
vs Square:
                  * If square: Internal struggle (authority vs innovation inside)
                  * As semi-square: External friction (authority projected outward causes pushback)

E. Orb
Tight orb (like other minors): 1-2°, sometimes 3°
________________


🟣 8. QUINCUNX / INCONJUNCT (150°)
Definition: Two planets at 150° angle (5 houses apart)
________________


A. Key Meanings
Keyword: MISUNDERSTANDING / COMPARTMENTALIZATION
“A quincunx, if you have your first planet here and the second one five houses away, is the house on either side of an opposition… it is a misunderstanding. It is a compartmentalization because one energy is so different from the other one that they literally do not understand each other.”
Characteristics:
                  * Blind spot between energies
                  * Can’t see how they relate
                  * Forced separation
                  * “Oil and water” (but worse than semi-sextile)
________________


B. The Challenge
Two Incompatible Truths:
“If you focus on one area of life, the other one has to suffer or feels like it can’t be involved. This is different from an opposition because you’re not feeling out of balance; you have two incompatible truths within you.”
vs Opposition:
                  * Opposition: Can balance, compromise, see both
                  * Quincunx: Can’t integrate, don’t understand connection
________________


C. Resolution
Requires Creativity:
“Key is to make them work together because once you make them work together, you unlock new doors to all kinds of things you never thought were possible.”
Methods:
                  * Compassion
                  * Creative solutions
                  * Blind faith (trust they CAN work together even when you can’t see how)
________________


D. Examples
Instructor’s Venus ⚻ Saturn:
“I have Venus, and it is quincunx my Saturn… I’ve had a very difficult time finding value in any career that I’ve ever had. I’ve always been able to make money because Venus is in my 10th house, but at the same time, I’ve also not really understood how to make money. I just do it. It’s really weird. I know how to make money, but it’s like I simultaneously somehow don’t really understand the systems of how everything’s calculated at all times.”
Setup:
                  * Venus in 10th house (career, money, value)
                  * Saturn in 3rd house (structure, authority, communication)
                  * Quincunx = can’t integrate
Manifestation:
                  * CAN make money (Venus 10th)
                  * CAN’T understand how (Saturn 3rd incompatible)
                  * Knows it works but not why
                  * Simultaneous success and confusion
The Blind Spot:
                  * Value (Venus) doesn’t connect to structure (Saturn)
                  * Make money without understanding systems
                  * Success despite lack of comprehension
________________


Instructor’s Chiron ⚻ Pluto & Neptune:
“I have Chiron, which is quincunx my Pluto. Chiron is quincunx my Neptune.”
Chiron in 10th house:
                  * Wounding/healing in career
                  * Quincunx transformation (Pluto)
                  * Quincunx spirituality (Neptune)
                  * Can’t integrate healing with transformation
                  * Work separately, not together
________________


E. Unlocking Potential
When Resolved:
“Once you make them work together, you unlock new doors to all kinds of things you never thought were possible.”
Process:
                  1. Accept they don’t naturally connect
                  2. Find creative bridge
                  3. Use blind faith (trust it’s possible)
                  4. Don’t force logical connection
                  5. Allow intuitive integration
________________


🟢 9. QUINTILE (72°) & BIQUINTILE (144°)
Definition: 72° and 144° angles (creative aspects)
________________


A. Nature
“I made you guys a slide so that you could look into it, but this is a good place to find creative talents and hidden natural abilities; they’re hidden. You don’t realize you can do them until you do them.”
Characteristics:
                  * Creative innovation
                  * Hidden talents
                  * Natural abilities (unconscious)
                  * Discover through doing
________________


B. Quintile (72°)
Keyword: CREATIVE INNOVATION (Outward)
“The quintile, when you see the quintile, it shows where you are creatively innovative and purposefully manifest things; this is intentional.”
Characteristics:
                  * Outward expression
                  * Intentional creativity
                  * Purposeful manifestation
                  * Conscious innovation
________________


C. Biquintile (144°)
Keyword: ARTISTIC TALENT (Inward)
“The bi-quintile shows you where you have access to creative and artistic talents; it’s less obvious and harder to grab onto. And it works inwardly.”
Characteristics:
                  * Inward talent
                  * Less obvious
                  * Harder to access
                  * Must discover through experience
________________


D. Examples
Instructor’s Mercury ⚕ Jupiter (Biquintile):
“The biquintile that I have here is between Mercury and Jupiter. So when it comes to like online, I’m very good at this; this is actually a perfect example. The whole reason that I was able to create my own system in astrology… is because I obsessed and I dove deep through hundreds and hundreds of online resources. That is because my Mercury is biquintile my Jupiter, and Jupiter is on my IC, so something that I was passionate about.”
Setup:
                  * Mercury (communication, learning)
                  * Jupiter (expansion, philosophy)
                  * Biquintile = hidden inward talent
Manifestation:
                  * Natural ability to synthesize information
                  * Obsessive research capability
                  * Didn’t know he had this talent until he did it
                  * Created unique system through this hidden gift
________________


Instructor’s Saturn ⚕ Neptune (Quintile):
“Saturn is quintile my Neptune, so Saturn here in the third house, and then Neptune in the fifth house. This is more outwardly on how you can express things. So when it came to my career in music, I was obsessive over that; that was the compulsion.”
Setup:
                  * Saturn (structure, career)
                  * Neptune (music, spirituality, media)
                  * Quintile = creative innovation outwardly
Manifestation:
                  * Music career obsession
                  * Structured creativity
                  * Intentional artistic expression
                  * Combined discipline with artistry
________________


IV. APPLYING VS SEPARATING
A. Definitions
Applying:
“When it’s applying, an aspect is stronger.”
                  * Faster planet approaching exact aspect
                  * Energy building
                  * Effect intensifying
                  * Peak: Exact aspect
Separating:
“When it is separating, an aspect is weaker.”
                  * Faster planet moving past exact aspect
                  * Energy waning
                  * Effect diminishing
                  * Fading influence
________________


B. How to Identify
In Chart:
                  * Check degrees
                  * Lower degree → higher degree = applying (if faster planet)
                  * Higher degree → lower degree = separating (if faster planet)
In Aspect Grid:
                  * Positive number = applying
                  * Negative number = separating
                  * Text states: “applying” or “separating”
________________


C. Example
Instructor’s Sun ☍ Moon:
“My sun and my moon have a relationship… it tells you up here, negative five, and then separating. So the faster planet is leaving, is already past the slower planet. In this case, the moon is the faster planet, the sun is the slower planet. So therefore, it’s separating, meaning the moon has already passed the sun in terms of the actual direct, the exact or direct aspect, that’s the other word they use, and is already on its way leaving.”
Analysis:
                  * Sun at 21° Gemini (slower)
                  * Moon at 25°57’ Aquarius (faster)
                  * Moon has passed Sun (was 21°, now at 26°)
                  * Separating opposition
                  * Energy waning
________________


D. In Transits
Jupiter-Saturn Example:
“The faster planet is Jupiter; the slower planet is Saturn. Saturn’s restriction, Jupiter’s expansion. The planet in the lead always takes control. That’s extremely important when you’re talking about these energies as they move forward, and you’re talking about applying versus separating. As Jupiter was applying to Saturn, it was much stronger than when Jupiter was leaving, because Jupiter was leaving the grasp of Saturn as opposed to the energies coming full force at each other.”
Pattern:
APPLYING (Jupiter → Saturn)
Jupiter building toward restriction
Saturn's influence growing
Peak at exact conjunction


SEPARATING (Jupiter past Saturn)
Jupiter escaped restriction
Saturn's hold weakening
Jupiter's expansion takes lead


Who’s in Control:
                  * Applying: Both equally strong (meeting)
                  * Exact: Peak intensity (battle)
                  * Separating: Faster planet takes lead (winner)
________________


V. TRANSITS
A. What Are Transits?
Definition:
“Transits are the energy of those planets, not inside our body, not impacting us on a personality basis, but how are they impacting us outwardly, inwardly? There’s a better way to say that: how are they pressuring us, basically? How is the external force impacting us and coming in on our lives?”
Key Concept:
                  * Natal chart: Fixed imprint (birth moment)
                  * Transits: Current planetary positions
                  * Interaction: Transits activate natal placements
________________


B. Natal vs Transit
Natal Chart:
“Your natal chart’s an imprint of the energies of the exact moment and location of your birth.”
                  * Permanent blueprint
                  * Your cosmic DNA
                  * Never changes
Transits:
“The planets continue to move, right? So your natal chart is imprint of the energies when you were born. Transits are where they are now; transits are the position of the planets.”
                  * Current sky
                  * Always moving
                  * Activating natal points
________________


C. Predictive Astrology
Using Ephemeris:
“When you’re doing predictive astrology, you can use an ephemeris or software. Every software, like astro.com, uses an ephemeris to power it… You can determine where they are now; you can determine where they were in the past, or you can determine where they will be in the future.”
Applications:
                  * Now: Current influences
                  * Past: Understanding what happened
                  * Future: Planning ahead
________________


D. How to Read Transits
On Astro.com:
                  1. Cast natal chart
                  2. Click “Add Transits”
                  3. Green glyphs appear (transits)
                  4. Black glyphs = natal
                  5. Compare positions
Interpretation:
“And the way you read this is, transit Saturn is conjunct transit sun, and that is conjunct my natal moon and natal Vesta. That’s how you would read that. You can read it however you want, but that’s the easiest way: transit to natal.”
Format:
Transit [Planet] [Aspect] Natal [Planet]


Examples:
- Transit Saturn conjunct Natal Moon
- Transit Mars square Natal Sun
- Transit Jupiter trine Natal Venus

E. Transit Orbs
Same as Natal:
“Same orbs of influence apply.”
                  * Use planet’s natal orb
                  * Example: Transit Saturn = 7-8° orb
                  * Example: Transit Moon = 2-3° orb
Special Note - Saturn Return:
“Saturn returns a 15-degree orb of influence. So mine started basically when Saturn entered Libra.”
                  * Saturn Return: When Saturn returns to natal position
                  * Larger orb for this specific event (15°)
                  * Begins when Saturn enters natal Saturn’s sign

VI. PLANETARY TRANSIT MEANINGS
☀️ Sun Transits
“When the sun transits through either a house or hits something, you feel energized; it brings creative expression. Children could be a focus. You just have to be very careful of overconfidence in this arena, or being egotistical, or having too much pride.”
Keywords:
                  * Energized
                  * Creative expression
                  * Children focus
                  * Watch for: Overconfidence, ego, pride
________________


🌙 Moon Transits
“Triggers emotional reactions to people or situations. Moon transits are extremely important to not allow it to make you reactionary; you will, you’ll naturally wanna react to it, and you have to be like, no, I know this is the moon, that’s the key.”
Keywords:
                  * Emotional reactions
                  * Triggers (unconscious)
                  * Reactionary behavior
Critical Warning:
                  * Fastest planet (2-3 days per sign)
                  * Most frequent transits
                  * Easiest to be controlled by
                  * Must recognize: “This is the Moon”
Strategy:
                  * Pause before reacting
                  * Recognize emotional trigger
                  * Choose response consciously
                  * Don’t let Moon control you

VII. ASPECT ORBS BY TYPE
A. Major Aspects
Wide Orbs:
Aspect
	Orb Range
	Notes
	Conjunction
	Full planet orbs
	Widest; Saturn 7-8° + Moon 2-3° = both apply
	Opposition
	~6-8°
	Slightly narrower than conjunction
	Square
	~6-8°
	Similar to opposition
	Trine
	~6-8°
	Same as square/opposition
	Instructor Note:
“It’s wider for trines, wider for oppositions, wider for squares because those are considered major aspects.”
________________


B. Minor Aspects
Tight Orbs:
Aspect
	Orb Range
	Notes
	Sextile
	1-2° (max 3°)
	Tight; must be close
	Semi-sextile
	1-2°
	Very tight
	Semi-square
	1-2° (max 3°)
	Tight
	Quincunx
	1-2° (max 3°)
	Tight
	Quintile
	Not specified
	Likely 1-2°
	Biquintile
	Not specified
	Likely 1-2°
	General Rule:
“The minor aspects, which are like the 30 degrees, 60 degrees, 150 degrees, they’re one to two degree orbs of influence.”
________________


C. Moon Exception
“The moon tends to have a two to three degree orb of influence always, but that’s because it matches.”
                  * Moon always 2-3° orb
                  * Applies to all aspect types
                  * Doesn’t expand for major aspects
________________


VIII. INTERPRETATION METHODS
A. Synthesis Approach
Don’t Read in Isolation:
“If I were to stop there, that would be very little information, which can happen. If my sun is not impacting anything else in the chart, then there’s nothing else to look at. The sun acts independently; it is not connected to anything else. Now, it’s very rare that you will ever come across any celestial body that doesn’t have some sort of aspect to something else in the chart.”
Process:
                  1. Find planet
                  2. Note sign & house (basic)
                  3. Find ALL aspects
                  4. Read each aspect’s meaning
                  5. Synthesize all aspects together
                  6. Factor in rulers
                  7. Check transits
                  8. Give holistic interpretation
________________


B. Reading Order (Review)
Priority:
                  1. Conjunctions (fusion/power)
                  2. Oppositions (awareness/balance)
                  3. Squares (conflict/growth)
                  4. Trines (flow/gift)
                  5. Minor aspects (nuance)
Within Each:
                  * Check zodiacal order (which planet first)
                  * Identify applying/separating
                  * Note exactness
                  * Factor both planets’ meanings

C. Instructor’s Full Example
Sun in Gemini (21°), 11th house:
Aspects Found:
                  1. ☍ Neptune (Sagittarius, 5th) - Separating
                  2. △ Moon (Aquarius, 7th)
                  3. △ Pluto (Libra, 3rd)
                  4. [Others not detailed]
Reading Process:
Step 1: Conjunction (None to Sun)
Step 2: Opposition
                  * Sun ☍ Neptune
                  * Order: Gemini → Sagittarius (Sun first)
                  * Sun informs Neptune
                  * Perception: Creative expression vs spiritual isolation (tug of war)
                  * Reality: Must express creatively (Sun) WITH spiritual depth (Neptune)
                  * Risk: Depression when Sun dims, Neptune takes over (illusion/loss)
Step 3: Trines (Grand Trine)
                  * Sun △ Moon △ Pluto (all Air)
                  * Automatic flow between creative expression, emotions, transformation
                  * Benefit: Natural compassion, intuition, depth
                  * Risk: Automatic inclusion means all three affected when one triggered
                  * Example: Saturn transit Moon → automatically affects Sun & Pluto
Synthesis:
“My sun in Gemini opposite Neptune in Sagittarius creates compassion and spirituality BUT also depression risk. The grand trine makes emotions, creativity, and transformation flow naturally, but I can’t separate them—when one’s down, all are down.”

________________


B. Patterns Identified
Grand Trine (Air):
                  * Sun (Gemini) △ Moon (Aquarius) △ Pluto (Libra)
                  * Creative expression + emotions + transformation
                  * Automatic flow (can’t separate)
Kite Pattern:
“My moon, my son, and my Pluto, and then Neptune, which sits over here. So, and then that brings in Jupiter; this brings in that, and then this brings in Mercury sitting in the same house.”
                  * Grand Trine + opposition point creates kite
                  * Sun/Moon/Pluto △△△ + Neptune ☍ Sun
                  * Pulls in Jupiter, Mercury through other aspects
                  * Complex interconnection

C. Real-Life Manifestations
Tech Issues (Class Recording):
“Just so you guys understand why this is happening, why aspects and transits are so frigging important to understand. Because once you understand… today’s 12… the moon is… at 16 degrees. In my chart, Saturn is at 15 degrees, meaning there’s an angle happening here, and Saturn is also semi-square my Uranus. So the whole tech issue thing that’s been going on has to do with all of this.”
Breakdown:
                  * Transit Moon at 16°
                  * Natal Saturn at 15° (conjunction)
                  * Saturn semi-square Uranus
                  * Result: Tech problems (Saturn restriction + Uranus electronics)

X. ADVANCED CONCEPTS
A. Stellium vs Satellitium (Review)
Stellium:
“Stelliums… is a cluster of conjunctions basically. It’s three or more planets in the same sign within the orb of influence of each other.”
                  * 3+ planets
                  * Same sign
                  * All within mutual orbs
                  * Energies blend
Satellitium:
“A satellitium is a cluster of planets within a sign that do not impact each other.”
                  * 3+ planets
                  * Same sign
                  * Outside mutual orbs
                  * Act independently
Instructor’s 3rd House Example:
Mars at 4°
Saturn at 15°
Pluto at 24°


Check orbs:
Mars (3-4°) → reaches ~8°
Saturn (7-8°) → reaches 7-23°
Pluto (2-3°) → reaches 21-27°


Result: NONE reach each other
= SATELLITIUM

B. Aspect Patterns
Grand Trine:
                  * 3 planets in trine
                  * Forms triangle
                  * Same element (usually)
                  * Automatic flow between all three
Kite:
                  * Grand trine + 1 opposition
                  * Creates kite shape
                  * Opposition point = focal point
                  * Harnesses trine energy toward goal
T-Square:
                  * 2 planets opposition + 1 square both
                  * Forms T shape
                  * High tension
                  * Drives achievement
Grand Cross:
                  * 4 planets, all square each other
                  * Forms + shape
                  * Maximum tension
                  * Extreme challenges OR achievements
(These patterns not detailed in transcript but mentioned for context)

XII. KEY QUOTES FOR APP
On Aspects:
“Aspects are the glue to astrology.”
“You have to fuse that energy in within the relationship to see how does your sun truly play out.”
On Conjunctions:
“The key word for conjunction is power, because you’re adding two planets together at the same space at the same time.”
On Oppositions:
“Oppositions have to do with awareness… you can pull energy from the other planet fairly easily by creating a compromise.”
On Squares:
“Without squares, progress through action would not exist… You need squares.”
“People who do amazing things in this world tend to have a lot of squares in their chart.”
On Trines:
“Grand trines or trines in general are often taken for granted.”
“These two planets are linked… it is unrestricted, and there’s nothing you can do about it.”
On Sextiles:
“The sextile is up to you… it’s an opportunity; you can use it.”
“It’s a hidden talent. It gives you the opportunity to evolve something you’re doing.”
On Semi-Sextiles:
“The second one is usually the issue; when you do the first one, it affects the second one.”
On Quincunx:
“Once you make them work together, you unlock new doors to all kinds of things you never thought were possible.”
On Moon Transits:
“Moon transits are extremely important to not allow it to make you reactionary… you have to be like, no, I know this is the moon, that’s the key.”
On Applying/Separating:
“The planet in the lead always takes control.”

ALCHEMISTIC ASTROLOGY - CLASS 4: TYING IT ALL TOGETHER
Complete Knowledge Extraction - Harvard-Level Documentation
________________


CLASS OVERVIEW & PEDAGOGICAL FRAMEWORK
Course Position & Prerequisites
This is Class 4 of a 5-7 class series designed to take students from “zero to 100” in Alchemistic Astrology. Critical prerequisite: Classes 1, 2, and 3 MUST be completed first, or this material will be incomprehensible. This is the first class with NO physical materials—pure application and synthesis.
Series Structure:
                  * Classes 1-3: Foundation (chart casting, interpretation basics, aspects/transits)
                  * Class 4 (THIS CLASS): Integration and application (“tying it all together”)
                  * Class 5: Manifestation techniques
                  * Classes 6-7: Advanced applications (money, etc.)
Pedagogical Approach
This class employs live chart analysis of three sample charts (later revealed as Britney Spears, Tony Robbins, and Halle Berry) to demonstrate the complete reading methodology. The instructor explicitly works through charts WITHOUT prior preparation, demonstrating real-time thinking processes.

CORE REVOLUTIONARY CONCEPT: THE LENS SYSTEM
Definition & Philosophy
Direct Quote:
“What’s most important about my system and what I’m teaching you here, and why I differ from almost every other astrologer out there, is in my system I devise something that I call lenses. Lenses are a filter that you put over, mentally, over the entire chart, that help you read a chart in a very specific manner and avoid all of the extraneous nonsense and the noise that has nothing to do with what answer you’re trying to achieve out of the chart.”
The Fundamental Problem:
 When people look at natal charts without a lens, one of two reactions occurs:
                  1. Insufficient Data Syndrome: “There’s not enough information here to tell me anything” (usually because they don’t layer deep enough)
                  2. Information Overload: “There are too many planets, too much math—how do I know what’s important?”
Both stem from the same error: attempting to read everything at once.
The Lens Solution
The Hardest Reading:
 Natal chart report readings (attempting to cover everything about a person) are explicitly described as:
                  * The hardest thing to do
                  * Nearly impossible to complete satisfactorily
                  * Can spend 45 minutes on first house alone and still not finish
                  * Always leaves clients with more questions
                  * Should be avoided or charged significantly more for
The Easiest & Most Effective Approach:
“The easiest way to do it, which is the way I prefer, is you ask me a question, and I’ll answer it. So when you’re doing your astrology readings, even if you’re doing them for yourself, ask the question. What is the question that we’re talking about? Is it love, is it money, career, finances, life purpose, friends, home, family, intimacy, travel?”
Core Questions Lenses Can Answer:
                  * Personality-based: “Why am I always having problems in love?”
                  * Career-based: “Why can’t I find my career? What type of career best suits me?”
                  * Financial: “How do I make money?”
                  * Psychological: “Why do I feel so down all the time?”

HOW LENSES TRANSFORM HOUSE MEANINGS
The Revolutionary Principle
Direct Quote:
“Every topic that you do, every single one is broken into sub parts. Everything in the world is broken down into further things that are broken down into further things. Your body is broken down into cells. Your cells are broken down into atoms. It keeps going down and down and down until you can’t break it down anymore. Once we get down to decans and dwads, there’s not much further we can go. Then we dive into rulerships, and we add in all the other pieces.”
Example: The LOVE Lens - All 12 Houses Redefined
Traditional (Wrong) Approach:
 Most astrologers: “Love is the 7th house” → End of discussion.
Result: Clients with empty 7th houses feel “lost and roadblocked.”
Alchemistic Approach:
“Love is an emotion. It is something you feel for something or someone. It can be difficult to describe, but if you break it down astrologically, every single one of these placements, every single one of these houses has to do with love.”
All 12 Houses Under the LOVE Lens:
                  1. 1st House: You as an individual—what you need to maintain your individuality within love; your solo endeavors within partnership context

                  2. 2nd House: Your values in love; what you value about relationships; financial resources within partnership

                  3. 3rd House: How you communicate in terms of love; love language; communication with partner; short trips together

                  4. 4th House: How you feel safe in love; emotional security needs; home life with partner; mother’s influence on your relationships

                  5. 5th House: ROMANCE (Leo trait)—“puppy love,” the first stage, taking risks, pride, feeling good, the fun stuff, baby love, courtship, the intro to love

                  6. 6th House: Your own health within relationships; how you serve your partner; daily routines with partner

                  7. 7th House: Your romantic partner; one-to-one interactions; the actual relationship and connection; first marriage

                  8. 8th House: INTIMACY (completely different from romance)—deep bonds, secrets, sexual intimacy, psychological merging; “you don’t get intimate with random romantic partners; you get intimate with people that you trust”

                  9. 9th House: Expansion, journeys, travel with partner; where you’re playful with your partner; the what-ifs; fantastical scenarios; how you explore within your love language

                  10. 10th House: How you like to be in public with your partner; how partnership affects your career/reputation

                  11. 11th House: Hopes and dreams within love context; friends’ influence on relationships; technology/internet in relationships; music, spirituality within love

                  12. 12th House: What goes on behind the scenes in love; spiritual connection; hidden aspects; things you keep private; potential abandonment or deception

Critical Teaching:
“When you’re looking at it in the context of love, all the themes of the houses stay exactly the same, but you have to dwindle them down into and chisel out, carve out your topic. And if it’s love, that’s what it is. When we get to career, it’s something completely different.”
Example: The CAREER Lens
Primary Career Houses:
                     * 2nd House: Money, earnings, financial resources
                     * 6th House: Daily work environment, what you do day-to-day, work routine
                     * 10th House: Career itself, public image, what you’re known for, structural role
                     * Midheaven (MC): Public projection, life purpose THEMES (not specific job)
Additional Career Considerations:
                     * 7th House: If self-employed or running own business (partnerships, contracts, public interaction)
                     * 5th House: Creative expression, entertainment work, working with children
                     * 8th House: Other people’s money, inheritance, taxes, legacy work
The MC vs. 10th House Distinction:
“The midheaven is not everybody aligns with it, which is surprising. If you align with your midheaven, which is the opposite of your IC, your IC being your deep personal self. If you can align with your midheaven, then you are doing the job that you want to do, that you should be doing, that you should be known for, and then you combine that with the 10th house and it creates your career.”

THE COMPLETE READING METHODOLOGY
Step-by-Step Workflow
STEP 1: Clarify the Lens/Question
 Always begin by determining the specific area of focus. Never attempt a general reading.
STEP 2: Identify Primary House for Lens
                     * Love → 7th house (then 5th for romance, 8th for intimacy)
                     * Career → 10th house (then 6th for work, 2nd for money)
                     * Children → 5th house (then additional houses for multiple children)
                     * Self/Identity → 1st house and Ascendant
STEP 3: Check for Planetary Occupants
 If planets occupy the house: Analyze each planet’s meaning in that context
If house is empty: GO TO RULERSHIP (this is critical)
STEP 4: Empty House Protocol
Direct Quote - Critical Correction:
“Empty houses are not really empty houses; empty houses just mean that your energy is not focused in that area of life. It does not mean that nothing happens in that area of life. In fact, this imaginary person could have an extremely active romantic life if its ruler is also aspecting other things because the rulership is far more important than the placements there, in my opinion.”
STEP 5: Layered Rulership Process
This is the CORE technical skill. Follow this chain:
Layer 1: Direct Rulership
                     1. Identify sign on house cusp
                     2. Find ruler planet of that sign
                     3. Note ruler’s house placement
                     4. Note ruler’s sign placement
Layer 2: Secondary Rulership
                     1. Find ruler of the SIGN your first ruler is in
                     2. Note that planet’s house and sign
                     3. Check aspects to both rulers
Layer 3: Tertiary Rulership (if needed)
 Continue the chain until you reach a natural stopping point
Example from Class (Sample 1 - Britney Spears):
Love Reading Chain:
                     * 7th house: Empty, Aries on cusp

                     * Aries ruler: Mars

                     * Mars location: 12th house, Virgo, 23 degrees

                     * Interpretation Layer 1: Relationships are “on the back burner,” hypercritical of partner, service to partner is behind-the-scenes or non-existent

                     * Virgo ruler: Mercury

                     * Mercury location: 3rd house, Sagittarius

                     * Interpretation Layer 2: Despite trying to keep relationships private (12th house), they WILL be talked about globally, published, broadcast—“it doesn’t matter how private they try to keep this relationship; it will never be private”

                     * Sagittarius ruler: Jupiter

                     * Jupiter location: 1st house (conjunct Pluto and Saturn)

                     * Interpretation Layer 3: Relationship issues tie back to self-worth, personal identity, career structures, and become explosive topics

STEP 6: Bi-Directional Rulership
Forward Direction: House → Sign → Ruler Planet → Ruler’s Location
Reverse Direction: Planet → Signs It Rules → Houses with Those Signs
Example:
 If Mars rules 7th house Aries, also check:
                        * Where is Aries? (7th house)
                        * Where is Scorpio (Mars’ other rulership)?
                        * How do both houses feed energy back to Mars?
STEP 7: Aspect Analysis
CRITICAL WARNING - Software Orb Errors:
Direct Quote:
“When you’re using astrological software… not every planet has the same orb of influence. So, when you’re looking at all of these glyphs down here—sextiles, conjunctions, semi-squares, quintiles, trines, inconjunctions—all of these, you have to look. Now, in conjunctions seem to be pretty consistent, so do semi-sextiles, but some of these I’ve noticed, especially squares, that they use a 10-degree orb of influence.”
Specific Warnings:
Moon & Pluto:
“The moon does not have a very large orb of influence, neither does Pluto. So when you’re using these two planets specifically and they’re going outside of a three-degree orb of influence… if it’s above 3 degrees, ignore it because it doesn’t apply. It’s not real.”
Example of False Aspect:
 Moon square Pluto at 7-degree orb = NOT A REAL ASPECT
“This can be very confusing when you’re reading charts because you may think that there’s like a moon square Pluto, and then you’re talking to this person like, oh, your moon square is Pluto… But positive or negative, if it’s above 3 degrees, it’s not there anyway, so you have to look into that.”
Mars to Midheaven:
“Mars conjunct the ascendant. So here it is, the ascendant and midheaven, right? 9 degrees? No, because Mars doesn’t have that much of an orb of influence, so these are not true. This person does not have a Mars square midheaven. This is nonsense.”
Aspect Reading Process:
                        1. Locate primary planet (e.g., Mars at 23 degrees)
                        2. Scan chart for planets within legitimate orb
                        3. Identify aspect type (trine, square, sextile, etc.)
                        4. Check if aspect is applying (approaching) or separating (leaving)
                        5. Interpret aspect meaning within the lens context
STEP 8: Stellium vs. Satellitium Analysis
Stellium (Official Definition):
“A stellium is a grouping of planets that are within the same house and sign, that are within an orb of influence of each other.”
Instructor’s Expanded Definition:
“Now, I take stelliums outside of the sign and house because I believe that those energies still work together and they still matter; you just have to then dive deeper into the signs and houses that you’re talking about when you start getting into the details of it.”
Satellitium:
“A satellitium is a bunch of planets that are in the same sign and house, but they are not within each other’s orb of influence, meaning they’re not close enough to actually influence each other. It is important to understand that a stellium creates its own set of energies, and a satellitium works within the same house and sign, affecting the same theme as opposed to affecting each other.”
STEP 9: Build the Narrative
Direct Quote:
“Break it apart, take it one thing at a time, add information, just keep adding information, and as you add, you have developed a narrative. If you’ve ever read a novel, you know you can’t just look at this thing about, oh yeah, you’re this and just walk away; no, you got to build it up. You’re building a character bio in a novel.”
Practical Advice:
“If you need to write it down like jot notes, jot it. Um, and that, you know, I mean, when you’re doing a reading, like if you can’t memorize everything you’ve just connected, write it down as you’re going, especially in the beginning, because it may help you remember how you connected things.”
STEP 10: Choose a Stopping Point
Critical Warning:
“In order to get dive into this, into everything here, especially personality, you’ve got to dive in layer by layer, structure by structure, piece by piece, and look at every single thing that has to do with this ruler, its placement, the aspects, and that’s how you get all your information, because the aspects will tell you, yes, this is good or there’s a conflict; no, this is bad, and that tells you, oh, okay, well, it can’t be a good thing, so how would that play out in a bad way? Well, conflict, struggle, strife, whatever.”
But also:
“If you don’t pick a stopping point, this will consume you and you’ll never get the reading done.”

COMPLETE SAMPLE CHART WALKTHROUGHS
SAMPLE CHART 1: BRITNEY SPEARS (Revealed at End)
Birth Data: December 2, 1981, 1:30 AM, Mississippi
Rising Sign: Libra
LOVE READING - Complete Analysis
Starting Point: 7th House
                        * Sign: Aries (Mars-ruled)
                        * Occupants: Empty
                        * Interpretation: Energy not focused on relationships themselves but expressed through ruler
Primary Ruler Chain:
Mars (7th House Ruler):
                        * Location: 12th house, Virgo, 23 degrees

                        * Lowest Vibration Interpretation:

                           * Relationships on “back burner”
                           * Hypercritical of partners
                           * Service to partner minimal or non-existent
                           * Don’t want to serve partner actively
                           * Highest Vibration Interpretation:

                              * Spiritual connection with partner
                              * Behind-the-scenes service (private, nobody knows)
                              * Very private partnership dynamics
                              * Reserved and shy about relationships
Decan Analysis:
 Mars at 23 degrees = Taurus decan
                              * Adds element of value and worth to the behind-the-scenes service
                              * Spiritual connection has material/sensual component
Secondary Ruler: Mercury
Mercury (Ruler of Virgo/12th House):
                              * Location: 3rd house, Sagittarius
                              * Forms satellitium with Sun, Neptune, Uranus
Critical Interpretation:
“this much energy here in the third house in Sagittarius tells me that it doesn’t matter how private they try to keep this relationship; it will never be private. It will be talked about, it will be communicated worldwide through cultures, published even.”
Stellium/Satellitium Breakdown in 3rd House:
Neptune (6th house ruler in 3rd):
                              * Work, health, daily routine will be talked about
                              * Neptune = illusions, not always truthful
                              * Stories become distorted
Sun (11th house ruler in 3rd):
                              * Leo energy = entertainment, publishing
                              * Hopes, dreams, networking, friends, internet, technology
                              * Creative expression, children—all discussed publicly
Mercury (double ruler - 9th & 12th):
                              * Travel (even short distances) discussed
                              * Philosophy and publications broadcast
                              * Behind-the-scenes aspects paradoxically made public
Uranus (5th house ruler in 3rd):
                              * Children discussed
                              * Romance discussed
                              * As mother with her children—major public topic
Tertiary Ruler: Jupiter
Jupiter (Ruler of Sagittarius/3rd House):
                              * Location: 1st house, conjunct Pluto and Saturn
                              * Expansive energy (Jupiter trait) = “little thing becomes big thing”
                              * Stories blown out of proportion
                              * Not always truthful (Neptune influence)
Aspect Analysis:
Mars at 23 degrees aspects:
Mars Trine Venus (4 degrees orb - legitimate):
                              * Venus: 4th house, Capricorn, 25 degrees
                              * Interpretation: Relationships harmonize with values and home
                              * Sensual appeal in relationships
                              * Values tied to father (Saturn-ruled Capricorn)
                              * Cooking together, food, eating—Venus rules food
                              * Specific Detail: “maybe they even like to go out to eat together, but they like to either have it ordered in or potentially cook at home… she likes to cook, and she does that behind the scenes”
Venus Semi-Sextile Neptune (1 degree orb):
                              * 25 degrees (Venus) to 24 degrees (Neptune)
                              * Agitation between values and illusion
                              * Relationships discussed but not always truthfully
                              * Stories told about relationships globally (Neptune in Sag/3rd)
Venus Square Pluto (legitimate orb):
                              * Transformation, volatility in relationships
                              * Death/rebirth cycles in partnerships
                              * Deep power dynamics
                              * Interpretation Shift: “this person expects their partner to cook for them at home; that’s how you would read that in terms of food, in terms of value, and father’s values”
                              * Role reversals expected
Mars Semi-Sextile Pluto:
                              * Pluto in 1st house
                              * Deep personal transformation through relationships
                              * Bottled emotions that eventually explode
Chiron Trine Mars (19 degrees to 23 degrees):
                              * Chiron: 10th house
                              * Relationships used to heal psychological wounds
                              * OR: Unresolved wounds immediately affect relationships
                              * Public career affected by relationship wounds
Summary Interpretation:
This person (Britney Spears) has relationships that are:
                              1. Meant to be private (Mars 12th house)
                              2. Paradoxically become global public knowledge (Mercury in Sag/3rd with stellium)
                              3. Critical and service-oriented but hidden from view
                              4. Tied to father’s values and home life
                              5. Volatile with transformation cycles (Pluto aspects)
                              6. Stories blown out of proportion and not always truthful (Neptune/Jupiter)
                              7. Affects her as a mother and her children publicly (Uranus connection)
                              8. Involves healing/wounds manifesting through public career (Chiron)
Instructor’s Summary:
“So, in order to analyze that even further… we talked about their love life always being on display, lots of issues within love, specifically in romance, and then we even talked a touch about their first child being a part of that and their romance, their intimacy issues.”

SAMPLE CHART 2: TONY ROBBINS (Revealed at End)
Lens: Family/Children
Starting with 5th House (Children)
5th House Occupants:
                              * Chiron: The wound, the psychological scar
                              * Other planets (details given during reading)
Instructor’s Approach:
“My first instinct, because I work with Chiron, Moon, and Pluto, is I wanna know… what’s going on with this Chiron.”
Why These Three?
“As an astrologer, I focus heavily on Pluto, the moon, and Chiron; those are my three points. I always hit them, or pretty much always hit them in almost every reading because I think that most answers lie there when there’s a roadblock or you can’t do something. Most questions revolve around why aren’t I this, why can’t I do this, why do I feel like this, which is a derivative of why do I, why can’t I? And it usually comes back to these three.”
Initial Analysis Chain:
Chiron in 5th House:
                              * Wound related to children/creativity/romance
                              * Sign: Aquarius (ruled by Uranus)
Uranus (Ruler of Aquarius):
                              * Location: 11th house
                              * “does bring some luck back into the situation”
Sun (Ruler of Leo/sign Uranus is in):
                              * Location: 6th house
                              * Health implications
                              * “this could be the death of a child, specifically speaking”
                              * OR “some sort of developmental issue within this child”
The Jupiter Factor:
                              * Jupiter expands everything it touches
                              * If Jupiter aspects this configuration, it expands the issue
Initial Interpretation (Later Corrected):
“I already know at this point that this is probably a heavy reading… this could be a heavy one… this could be, this could be… the death of a child, specifically speaking… If it is not the death of a child, then it is some sort of developmental issue within this child… or something that’s expanded out…”
Critical Revision After Aspect Re-Check:
Upon reviewing aspects more carefully:
“that’s not a loss. … So, this is an illusion; this is a loss, but it’s not a loss of life; this is a loss of connection.”
Explanation:
 If there was a direct trine (harmonious aspect) still connecting the relevant planets, this indicates survival and connection, just a difficult or distant one. The initial reading of “death” was corrected to “disconnection” or “developmental challenge.”
Multiple Children Analysis:
House System for Children:
                              * 5th house: First child
                              * 7th house: Second child (derived house: 3rd from 5th)
                              * 9th house: Third child (derived house: 3rd from 7th)
Instructor Notes:
“This is also the first child, this is the second child, and a third child would be up here. This is them as a father, this is them as a mother.”
Linking Houses for Child Analysis:
“Now, all of these houses mean something when it comes to the context of children when you link it in. … This is their health … This is their one-on-one relationships, which may have to do with children.”
Complexity Note:
 The instructor acknowledges this reading involves multiple layers of rulerships, aspects, and interconnections, requiring extensive jotting/note-taking during the analysis process.

SAMPLE CHART 3: HALLE BERRY (Revealed at End)
Lens: Career
Birth Data: [Specific data provided]
Rising Sign: Taurus
Instructor’s Disclaimer:
“And I’m telling you for real, I have not looked at this prior to starting this class.”
Career Analysis Framework
Primary Career Houses:
“So 10th house, usually they say 10th, 6th, and 2nd. Well, 2nd is money, 6th is your work and your work environment, what you do on a daily basis, and then the 10th house is your career. It’s your public image; it’s what you know, what you are known for, and what you kind of do structurally.”
2nd House Analysis (Money):
                              * Sign: Gemini
                              * Ruler: Mercury
                              * Mercury location: 4th house
                              * Interpretation: Makes money through communication, potentially entertainment
                              * Connection to home and family
6th House Analysis (Daily Work):
                              * Daily work environment
                              * Routine activities
                              * Health considerations in work
10th House Analysis (Career/Public Image):
                              * Career structure
                              * What person is known for
                              * Public reputation
Venus Analysis (Critical for Taurus Rising):
Venus as Ascendant Ruler:
                              * Represents the person’s overall energy
                              * How they present to the world
                              * Core values and self-worth
Venus Position:
                              * Opposes Midheaven (MC)
                              * At 29 degrees (critical degree)
                              * Sextile to 10th house ruler
Key Interpretation:
“What actually makes them known and known for being private is the fact that Venus is opposite the midheaven, so their stuff from internally is put into their career. Their career and their outward projection is actually bringing energy from their private life, so this is how you know they’re private, but people know them.”
The Privacy Paradox:
“Their daily life ties back into how they make their money; their work ties directly back into their, again, this is opposing Midheaven. It’s at 29 degrees, and there’s a sextile with the ruler of the 10th house… and you have Jupiter here. Jupiter’s the ruler of the 8th house that keeps this person also very intimate, very secretive, right?”
Career Themes Identified:
                              1. Communication and entertainment (Gemini/Mercury)
                              2. Private yet publicly known (Venus opposite MC)
                              3. Work involves home, family, children (4th house connections)
                              4. Intimate yet famous (Jupiter/8th house involvement)
                              5. Career brings private life into public view paradoxically
Empty House Protocol Demonstrated:
When asked about reliance on others’ money:
“Empty houses don’t mean that these things don’t happen in your life; in fact, a lot of stuff can happen career-wise. If you have a 7th house and it’s empty, it doesn’t mean you’re not going to get married. It just means that your focus is not on the interaction, one-to-one relationships, and the energy; that energy is pulled somewhere else.”
Summary for Halle Berry:
 Career involves communication/entertainment, with strong private-yet-public dynamic. Work connects to home and family. Known for being private despite fame. Likely works with or about children given connections shown.

ADVANCED TECHNIQUES TAUGHT
Lens Within a Lens
Definition:
 Analyzing a sub-topic within a broader topic lens.
Example Given:
“So now we’re a lens within a lens; we’re talking about the lens of her values within her father, within the lens of a relationship.”
Process:
                              1. Start with primary lens (e.g., Love)
                              2. Identify sub-question (e.g., “What role do father’s values play?”)
                              3. Apply secondary lens filter to same chart elements
                              4. Trace ruler chains specific to sub-question
                              5. Return to primary lens with enhanced understanding
Warning:
“Don’t get overwhelmed; pause, go back if you need to, take a look at everything that got us to this point. I promise you it gets easier over and over because it just becomes second nature as you’re going.”
The String Theory Approach
Instructor’s Description:
“When you have so many planets impacting each other, you have to do this like string theory. It feels like like this one links to this, then this happens to this, and then you’re doing the readings. You’re like, I gotta pull all this third house energy into this twelfth house energy, into the in the first house energy, with the fifth house, right? Or I’m sorry, with the fourth because we’re talking about Venus.”
Visualization:
 Imagine a detective’s evidence board with strings connecting different pieces of information—each planet, house, ruler, and aspect is a node, and you trace the connections relevant to your lens.
Decans and Further Subdivision
Reference:
“Everything in the world is broken down into further things that are broken down into further things. Your body is broken down into cells. Your cells are broken down into atoms. It keeps going down and down and down until you can’t break it down anymore. Once we get down to decans and dwads, there’s not much further we can go.”
Example Used:
 Mars at 23 degrees Virgo = Taurus decan
                              * Adds Taurus qualities (value, worth, sensuality) to the Mars placement
                              * Refines interpretation beyond just “Mars in Virgo”
Progressions for Timing
Mentioned for Career Changes:
 When doing career readings for specific individuals with actual ages, progressions must be checked:
                              * Have they moved? (Relocation charts)
                              * What’s their age? (Progression charts)
                              * Recent major life changes? (Check progressed Ascendant/Midheaven)
Progression Indicators:
 When progressed Ascendant or Midheaven flips signs, major life changes occur:
                              * Appearance changes
                              * Career shifts
                              * Identity transformations
                              * Public image alterations

INSTRUCTOR’S PERSONAL READING PRIORITIES
The Big Three: Chiron, Moon, Pluto
Direct Quote:
“If someone’s asking for a love reading, and you’re reading these charts. You’re like, okay, let’s go to your romance. Honestly, what I always start with is Chiron, but I’m not gonna do that for this because we’re not really talking about Chiron too much in this, so I’m gonna skip that. As an astrologer, I focus heavily on Pluto, the moon, and Chiron; those are my three points.”
Why These Three?
“I always hit them, or pretty much always hit them in almost every reading because I think that most answers lie there when there’s a roadblock or you can’t do something. Most questions revolve around why aren’t I this, why can’t I do this, why do I feel like this, which is a derivative of why do I, why can’t I? And it usually comes back to these three.”
Functional Interpretation:
                              * Chiron: The wound, psychological scars, healing journey
                              * Moon: Emotional needs, mother, instinctive reactions
                              * Pluto: Transformation, power, what’s buried, intensity
Love Reading Priorities
Instructor’s Focus Houses:
“For love readings, I do five, seven, eight. I read the entire chart, but five, seven, eight, excuse me, that’s what I focus on, right? Because for me, love is romance, the actual relationship and connection, how they interact, and then the intimacy. From there, I jump around because everything else is important and included, but those are the main three aspects.”
Breakdown:
                              * 5th House: Romance (courtship, risk, fun, Leo energy)
                              * 7th House: The relationship (partnership, marriage, one-on-one)
                              * 8th House: Intimacy (deep bonds, sex, psychological merging)

COGNITIVE PROCESSING NOTES
The Instructor’s Thinking Speed
Self-Awareness Statement:
“By the way, I think very fast. I’ve shown you guys my chart in previous classes. Uh, my mercury square, or a square, my mercury is trining my mars. My mercury is opposite uranus, so my brain moves very fast. So what ends up happening for me is I end up seeing these relationships before my brain processes it, or my brain processes it before I can put it into a thought. I don’t really know how to explain it, but it’s very quick.”
Teaching Adjustment:
“I want to make sure that you guys can do this as well.”
The instructor acknowledges processing information faster than they can verbalize it, and consciously slows down to ensure students can follow the linking process.
Building Neural Pathways
Encouragement:
“The more you do this, the more it’ll start clicking in your head because you won’t have to stop every five seconds to remind yourself of what each one of these planets means, even though I do hundreds of chart readings every month; I still have to stop for some of these, especially semi-sextiles, because they are more difficult to work with.”
Process Timeline:
                              * Initially: Must stop frequently, jot notes, look up meanings
                              * Intermediate: Recognize patterns faster, fewer lookups
                              * Advanced: See connections instantly, but still pause for complex configurations
________________


PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION GUIDELINES
For Beginners
Write Everything Down:
“If you need to write it down like jot notes, jot it. Um, and that, you know, I mean, when you’re doing a reading, like if you can’t memorize everything you’ve just connected, write it down as you’re going, especially in the beginning, because it may help you remember how you connected things.”
Start Simple:
                              1. Pick ONE lens
                              2. Follow ONE ruler chain completely
                              3. Check ONE set of aspects
                              4. Build the story incrementally
                              5. Stop when you have sufficient answer
Don’t Get Overwhelmed:
“This is the most important thing of what I’m saying: you have to break it down, or this will become extremely overwhelming, and that’s what we don’t want for anybody. You don’t have to go as far layered down as I’m going, but the further you go, the more details you’re going to get because energy that is linked to energy that is ruled by other energy that conflicts with other energy, all it’s doing is whittling away the possibilities.”
The Depth Trade-Off
More Layers = More Precision:
“You don’t have to go as far layered down as I’m going, but the further you go, the more details you’re going to get because energy that is linked to energy that is ruled by other energy that conflicts with other energy, all it’s doing is whittling away the possibilities.”
Choose Your Stopping Point:
“If you don’t pick a stopping point, this will consume you and you’ll never get the reading done.”
Balance Required:
                              * Deep enough for accuracy and satisfaction
                              * Not so deep you never finish
                              * Practical considerations (time limits, client needs)
Building Proficiency
The Language Learning Analogy:
“It’s kinda like when you’re in Spanish class if you if you learn the words and then kind of put together a phrase, and then… oh god, what are they called? Conjunctions, no, not conjunctions, what are they called, uh… I can’t remember the word right now, but it’s the tenses, past, present, future. I don’t know why I can’t remember the word right now, but yeah, I struggled with that. And then you have to learn the slang, and then you have to put it all together, and you have a sentence, and you’re speaking a language. It’s just like that.”
Stages:
                              1. Learn vocabulary (planets, signs, houses)
                              2. Learn grammar (aspects, rulers, orbs)
                              3. Learn phrases (common configurations)
                              4. Learn context (lenses, applications)
                              5. Speak fluently (instant pattern recognition)
________________


CRITICAL CORRECTIONS TO TRADITIONAL ASTROLOGY
1. Empty Houses Are NOT Empty
Traditional View: Empty house = nothing happens in that life area
Alchemistic View: Empty house = energy not focused there, but ruler still determines how it manifests
Example Given:
“Empty houses are not really empty houses; empty houses just mean that your energy is not focused in that area of life. It does not mean that nothing happens in that area of life. In fact, this imaginary person could have an extremely active romantic life if its ruler is also aspecting other things because the rulership is far more important than the placements there, in my opinion.”
2. Software Orbs Are Often Wrong
Problem: Most software uses 10-degree orbs for all aspects and all planets
Reality: Each planet has specific orb ranges, and some aspects need tighter orbs
Critical Planets with Tight Orbs:
                              * Moon: 2-3 degrees maximum
                              * Pluto: 2-3 degrees maximum
                              * Mercury: 2-3 degrees
                              * Venus: 5-6 degrees (slightly wider)
                              * Mars: 3-4 degrees
Wider Orbs:
                              * Sun: 8-10 degrees
                              * Jupiter: 7-8 degrees
                              * Saturn: 7-8 degrees
Action Required:
 Manually verify every aspect shown by software against these orb ranges. Ignore aspects outside legitimate orbs.
3. Stelliums Extend Across Cusps
Traditional Definition: Planets must be in same sign AND house, within orb
Alchemistic Expansion: If planets are within orb of each other, they form stellium energy even if crossing sign or house cusps
Reasoning:
 Energy doesn’t stop at arbitrary lines. If planets are close enough to aspect each other (within orbs), they function as a unit.
4. Love Is NOT Just 7th House
Traditional View: 7th house = love, end of story
Alchemistic View: All 12 houses relate to love in different ways when using the love lens
Revolutionary Impact:
 This single correction transforms how love readings are done, providing answers even for empty 7th houses.
5. Career Requires Multiple House Analysis
Traditional View: 10th house = career
Alchemistic View: 2nd (money) + 6th (daily work) + 10th (career structure) + MC (life purpose) + 7th (if self-employed) = complete career picture
________________


PREDICTIVE ASTROLOGY CONSIDERATIONS
The Manifestation Variable
Problem with Predictions:
“Until I teach you all how to do this and you’re actually manifesting with it, then it’s not as easy. I know it’ll stay within the scope because you can only use the energy that you have to use, but then you’ll be changing things. So I hope to get to that point; I hope it gets harder to read people.”
Current Reality:
 Most people don’t know astrology, so they live at the lowest vibration of their energy by default, making predictions easier and more accurate.
Future Vision:
 As more people learn to consciously work with their chart energies, they’ll manifest differently, making prediction harder but empowering individuals.
Lowest vs. Highest Vibration
Default State:
“Energy does resonate at its lowest vibration. This is why I can get so accurate with most people most of the time, is because energy will play out the way that it normally plays out at its lowest frequency setting 99% of the time, unless somebody is changing something.”
Examples from Sample 1:
Mars in 12th House Virgo (7th House Ruler):
                              * Lowest Vibration: Relationships on back burner, hypercritical, doesn’t serve partner
                              * Highest Vibration: Spiritual connection, private devotion, behind-the-scenes service with value
Reading Strategy:
 Start with lowest vibration assumption unless client demonstrates conscious work or higher-vibration manifestation.
The “Why” Questions
Most Common Client Questions:
                              * “Why aren’t I [achieving something]?”
                              * “Why can’t I [do something]?”
                              * “Why do I feel like [negative emotion]?”
The Pattern:
“Most questions revolve around why aren’t I this, why can’t I do this, why do I feel like this, which is a derivative of why do I, why can’t I? And it usually comes back to these three [Chiron, Moon, Pluto].”
Implication:
 Roadblocks typically trace back to:
                              * Chiron: Wounds that haven’t healed
                              * Moon: Emotional needs not met
                              * Pluto: Transformation resisted or power struggles

ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS & READING LIMITATIONS
Binary Predictions Are Problematic
Example: “Will I Have Children?”
 The instructor explains this cannot be answered with simple yes/no because:
                              1. Energy is malleable
                              2. Free will exists
                              3. Transits change circumstances
                              4. Conscious manifestation alters outcomes
Better Question:
 “If I have children, what will that experience be like?”
OR
“What does my chart say about my relationship with children/creativity?”
Natal Chart Limitations
What Natal Charts DON’T Show:
                              * Exact timing (need progressions and transits)
                              * Whether person has moved (need relocated charts)
                              * Current age-specific manifestations (need progression charts)
                              * Conscious spiritual work done (transcending lower vibrations)
Example Given:
 When doing Sample 1’s reading, the instructor notes:
“If I’m actually doing a report reading for you and you’re, let’s say you’re 33 years old, you know, I’ve got to, I got to look at progressions. Have you moved? I got to look at your relocations. Like it gets very, very in depth.”
The Complexity Acknowledgment
On Human Beings:
“We are complex individuals, so it makes sense.”
On Complete Readings:
“I could spend 45 minutes on your first house and still not get done.”
Professional Advice:
 The instructor recommends:
                              1. Charge significantly more for full natal chart readings
                              2. Prefer lens-focused readings (more satisfying for clients)
                              3. Set clear boundaries on reading scope
                              4. Accept that even thorough readings will leave questions

VALIDATION & VERIFICATION
The Plot Twist
At the end of the class, after completing all three readings without knowing the identities, the instructor reveals:
Sample 1: Britney Spears
Sample 2: Tony Robbins
Sample 3: Halle Berry
Verification Process
For Britney Spears:
 The instructor validates:
                              * Love life always on display ✓
                              * Lots of relationship issues ✓
                              * Romance problems ✓
                              * First child involved in public relationship drama ✓
                              * Intimacy issues ✓
For Tony Robbins:
 The instructor researches and corrects:
                              * Initial reading: potential child death
                              * Correction after aspect re-check: loss of connection, not loss of life
                              * Validation: Confirms developmental or relationship challenges with first child
                              * Updated interpretation aligns with biographical information
For Halle Berry:
 The instructor validates:
                              * Career in entertainment/communication ✓
                              * Known for being private despite fame ✓
                              * Private life tied to public career ✓
                              * Work involves family/children themes ✓
Teaching Point on Corrections
The Tony Robbins Correction:
 The instructor demonstrates professional integrity by:
                              1. Making initial interpretation based on first reading
                              2. Revisiting aspects when something doesn’t feel right
                              3. Correcting the interpretation when finding tighter harmonious aspects
                              4. Explaining the reasoning for the change
                              5. Researching to validate the corrected reading
Quote:
“that’s not a loss. … So, this is an illusion; this is a loss, but it’s not a loss of life; this is a loss of connection.”
Why This Matters:
 Shows students that:
                              * Readings require checking and re-checking
                              * Aspects can be initially missed
                              * Corrections are professional, not failures
                              * Accuracy improves with thoroughness

PEDAGOGICAL INSIGHTS
Learning Curve Acknowledgment
The Instructor’s Honesty:
“I’ve been doing astrology for like six or seven years now obsessively, and I’m still finding new things in my chart because it’s impossible to go through every single aspect in every area of life, in every situation that could occur based off of just one reading.”
Realistic Expectations:
                              * No one masters astrology quickly
                              * Even experienced astrologers discover new layers
                              * Continuous learning is part of the practice
                              * Depth is infinite; proficiency is gradual
Common Student Mindsets Addressed
Mindset 1: Not Enough Information
“The first mindset is there’s not a lot going on in this chart. Once I know what Chiron means, that’s all I need to know. Once I know what Jupiter means, that’s what I need to know. If you’re of that mindset, maybe you need to revisit classes one, two, and three again because it’s so much more complex and involved than just the simple placement here.”
Solution: Layer deeper with rulers and aspects.
Mindset 2: Too Much Information
“Or you’re of the other mentality of saying this is a lot of information. How do we possibly decipher this into any sort of question because there’s just always something going on in every area of the chart?”
Solution: Apply lenses to filter noise.
The Learning Language Analogy
Complete Comparison:
“It’s kinda like when you’re in Spanish class if you if you learn the words and then kind of put together a phrase, and then… you have to learn the tenses, past, present, future… And then you have to learn the slang, and then you have to put it all together, and you have a sentence, and you’re speaking a language. It’s just like that.”
Application to Astrology:
                              1. Vocabulary: Planet meanings, sign meanings, house meanings
                              2. Grammar: Rulerships, aspects, orbs
                              3. Phrases: Common configurations (stelliums, T-squares, grand trines)
                              4. Tenses: Progressions, transits, timing
                              5. Slang: Context-specific interpretations, lens applications
                              6. Fluency: Instant pattern recognition, narrative building

PROFESSIONAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES
Pricing Strategy
Lens-Focused Readings:
                              * More satisfying for clients
                              * Clearer scope
                              * Easier to complete
                              * Higher success rate
                              * Standard pricing
Full Natal Readings:
                              * Extremely time-intensive
                              * Often leave clients unsatisfied
                              * Impossible to complete fully
                              * Should charge significantly more
                              * Consider avoiding entirely
Quote:
“I don’t do those like hardly ever. And when I do, I charge a lot more, and I would advise the same for everybody else because you are diving so deep into so many areas, and you’re still not giving enough information that people are going to be satisfied. There’s always going to be questions at the end.”
Setting Client Expectations
Scope Definition:
 Always clarify at the start:
                              * What specific question are we answering?
                              * What area of life are we focusing on?
                              * What time period (natal only, or with transits)?
                              * What level of detail is appropriate?
Boundary Setting:
“You have to take a look at all of this, plus if I’m actually doing a report reading for you and you’re, let’s say you’re 33 years old, you know, I’ve got to, I got to look at progressions. Have you moved? I got to look at your relocations. Like it gets very, very in depth.”
Managing Depth:
 Choose stopping points deliberately to avoid:
                              * Endless reading sessions
                              * Client overwhelm
                              * Astrologer burnout
                              * Incomplete analysis due to time constraints
Note-Taking During Readings
For Astrologer:
“If you need to write it down like jot notes, jot it. Um, and that, you know, I mean, when you’re doing a reading, like if you can’t memorize everything you’ve just connected, write it down as you’re going, especially in the beginning, because it may help you remember how you connected things.”
Benefits:
                              1. Tracks complex ruler chains
                              2. Documents aspect webs
                              3. Ensures nothing forgotten
                              4. Provides reference for later
                              5. Helps organize narrative
For Client:
 Consider providing written notes or recording sessions so clients can review complex information later.
________________


PHILOSOPHICAL UNDERPINNINGS
Free Will vs. Determinism
Alchemistic Position:
 Energy is malleable; people can consciously work with their chart to manifest higher vibrations.
Current Reality:
“Energy does resonate at its lowest vibration. This is why I can get so accurate with most people most of the time, is because energy will play out the way that it normally plays out at its lowest frequency setting 99% of the time, unless somebody is changing something.”
Future Vision:
“But most people don’t know anything about astrology, and that’s what makes predictions a bit easier these days. Until I teach you all how to do this and you’re actually manifesting with it, then it’s not as easy. I know it’ll stay within the scope because you can only use the energy that you have to use, but then you’ll be changing things. So I hope to get to that point; I hope it gets harder to read people.”
Implication:
 The goal is empowerment, not fatalism. Astrology should help people understand their energies and consciously work with them, not trap them in predetermined outcomes.
Complexity as Truth
Recognition of Human Depth:
“We are complex individuals, so it makes sense.”
Against Oversimplification:
 The entire lens system, layering methodology, and multi-house approach all reject simplistic “this planet = this trait” astrology in favor of nuanced, interconnected interpretation.
The Infinity Problem:
“I’ve been doing astrology for like six or seven years now obsessively, and I’m still finding new things in my chart because it’s impossible to go through every single aspect in every area of life, in every situation that could occur.”
Acceptance:
 Complete analysis is impossible; practical application requires boundaries and priorities.

NEXT CLASS PREVIEW
Class 5: Time to Manifest
Teaser:
“The fifth class, which is the next one, is the manifestation class. So hopefully you’ll watch this one as many times as you need. You’ll learn what you need from this class to take it forward and be able to actually manifest. That’s gonna be a fun class too, because we’ll be taking energies and talking about the polarities of those energies and how you can make things work for yourself, including a little bit with transits.”
Expected Topics:
                              1. Polarity work with planetary energies
                              2. Transmuting lower vibrations to higher ones
                              3. Using transits for manifestation timing
                              4. Conscious energy work
                              5. Practical manifestation techniques
Connection to Class 4:
 This class (4) provides the analytical foundation—understanding the chart deeply through lenses and layering. Class 5 will build on this foundation to teach active manifestation and energy transformation.
________________


KEY TAKEAWAYS FOR IMPLEMENTATION
The Big Picture
                              1. Always Apply a Lens: Never read a chart without a specific question/focus
                              2. Layer Ruthlessly: Follow rulers multiple levels deep
                              3. Verify Orbs Manually: Software is often wrong about aspect legitimacy
                              4. Empty Houses Have Rulers: Never ignore a house just because it’s empty
                              5. Build Narratives: Add information incrementally like writing a novel
                              6. Choose Stopping Points: Depth is infinite; practicality requires boundaries
                              7. Write It Down: Especially as beginner, jot notes to track connections
                              8. All Houses Relate to All Topics: Context (lens) determines interpretation
Technical Mastery Checklist
✓ Know legitimate orb ranges for each planet
✓ Identify sign on house cusp relevant to lens
✓ Find ruler planet and its placement
✓ Follow ruler chain at least 2-3 levels deep
✓ Check aspects within legitimate orbs only
✓ Distinguish applying vs. separating aspects
✓ Recognize stelliums vs. satellitiums
✓ Interpret decans for additional nuance
✓ Apply bi-directional rulership
✓ Build narrative incrementally
Professional Practice Essentials
✓ Set clear scope with clients
✓ Charge appropriately for depth of work
✓ Manage client expectations about completeness
✓ Document complex chains during reading
✓ Focus on actionable insights, not fatalism
✓ Validate interpretations when possible
✓ Correct errors professionally when found
✓ Prioritize Chiron, Moon, Pluto for roadblocks
Philosophical Commitments
✓ Energy is malleable, not deterministic
✓ Humans are complex; simple answers insufficient
✓ Lowest vibration is default, but not only option
✓ Empowerment over prediction
✓ Continuous learning is inherent to practice
✓ Free will exists within energetic parameters

INSTRUCTOR’S CHART REFERENCES
Throughout the class, the instructor references their own chart to explain their thinking process:
Mercury Aspects:
                              * Mercury trine Mars: Fast action-oriented thinking
                              * Mercury opposite Uranus: Extremely rapid, revolutionary thought patterns
                              * Result: “My brain moves very fast. So what ends up happening for me is I end up seeing these relationships before my brain processes it, or my brain processes it before I can put it into a thought.”
Self-Awareness in Teaching:
 The instructor acknowledges their thinking speed might make it difficult for students to follow and consciously slows down, repeats connections, and encourages pausing/rewatching.
________________


FINAL SYNTHESIS
This class represents the integration point in the Alchemistic Astrology curriculum. Students who have learned the mechanics (Classes 1-3) now see how to apply everything simultaneously through the lens system.
The Revolutionary Elements:
                              1. Lenses replace aimless chart reading with focused inquiry
                              2. Layered rulership provides depth traditional astrology lacks
                              3. Manual orb verification corrects widespread software errors
                              4. Empty house reinterpretation solves common reading roadblocks
                              5. Multi-house topic analysis (all houses for love, etc.) gives comprehensive answers
                              6. Lowest/highest vibration framework allows both prediction and empowerment
                              7. Narrative building transforms data into meaningful stories
The Practice Path:
Beginners → Intermediate → Advanced → Master
                              * Learn vocabulary → Build phrases → Speak sentences → Achieve fluency
                              * One ruler chain → Multiple chains → Interconnected webs → Instant recognition
                              * Single lens → Lens within lens → Multiple simultaneous lenses → Holistic synthesis
The Ultimate Goal:
Empower individuals to understand their energetic patterns so deeply that they consciously transmute lower vibrations into higher ones, making fatalistic prediction obsolete and conscious manifestation the norm.
Class Completion Marker:
Students completing this class should be able to:
                              1. Read any chart with a specific lens applied
                              2. Layer rulerships at least 2-3 levels deep
                              3. Verify aspect legitimacy independently
                              4. Build coherent narrative from fragmented data
                              5. Interpret empty houses effectively
                              6. Choose appropriate stopping points
                              7. Prepare for manifestation work (Class 5)

CLASS OVERVIEW & COURSE POSITION
Series Culmination
Direct Quote:
“Welcome to the Rebel Academy Astrology Manifestation Crash Course. Class number five, which wraps it up, is basically a zero to 100; if you got to this class, you already know this, but zero to 100 from nothing to everything.”
This is the final class of the foundational series (Classes 1-5), designed to transform theoretical knowledge into practical manifestation power.
Course Journey:
                              * Classes 1-3: Technical foundations (chart mechanics, interpretation, aspects/transits)
                              * Class 4: Integration (“Tying It All Together”)
                              * Class 5 (THIS CLASS): Practical manifestation and conscious energy manipulation
The Revolutionary Premise
The Fundamental Disagreement with Traditional Astrology:
Direct Quote:
“The average person who gets into astrology, professional astrologers, they believe that energy is energy. It plays out, it’s like fate, destiny, like it’s a roadmap that you can guide, but you can’t actually change, and I strongly disagree with that. I don’t think there’s a point in learning this aside from knowledge if that were the case.”
The Alchemistic Position:
“I think, and I know because I’ve used it, I’ve manifested so many things for myself, both with and without astrology, and I’ll tell you, it’s a hell of a lot easier when you have astrology to do so. And just knowing that you can take energies that may not feel so great for you and turn them into something that is magnificent for you, there’s nothing like it.”
The Observable Problem:
“And you’re watching other people who don’t believe in astrology, even the ones who do, who don’t believe that you can manifest with astrology, which I think might be worse, sit there and kind of fall behind.”
Class Structure
Three Main Components:
                              1. MINDSET: The psychological and environmental foundation
                              2. TRANSMUTATION: The technical process of energy manipulation
                              3. DIVINE TIMING: Using transits and progressions for optimal manifestation
No Physical Materials:
“I don’t have any materials for this class other than my little splash here, so there’s nothing for you to like review and go over. It’s just gonna be showing you how to do this and a little bit of a conversation here.”
This is pure application - demonstrating live chart work with a fictitious person named “Dolores.”
________________


COMPONENT 1: MINDSET - THE FOUNDATION
The Belief System Requirement
Core Philosophy:
Direct Quote:
“Mindset is so important because it’s kind of like what I just talked about, where a lot of astrologers don’t believe that you can transmute with these energies, that you can actually do something with them. They believe that they are static, fated points, and that’s all they are, and I do think that some of them are. I think that some of those energies are a little too intense for us mortal human beings to be able to do much with, but I think the rest of them are completely malleable, and we can live the type of life that we want to.”
The Manifestation Law:
“And if you manifestation-wise, what you believe is what you achieve, meaning if you believe that this cannot work, it won’t. If you believe that astrology is a roadmap to your fate and destiny, and you’re just along for the ride like a side seat passenger, then that’s what you will be. But if you believe that you can harness this energy and transmute it and turn it, then you can. I promise you, you can because I’ve done it.”
The Non-Negotiable Prerequisite
Toxic Elimination:
Direct Quote (Critical):
“None of this matters if you vibe with toxic people or toxic situations; I cannot help you if that’s the type of life you continue to lead. So if you really wanna manifest things in your life, you’re going to have to set yourself a mindset that allows you a clear path forward.”
The “Vibe Higher” Philosophy
Origin & Meaning:
Direct Quote:
“And in my podcast, in a lot of my videos on social media, I talk about what I’ve kind of coined as my catchphrase, which is vibe higher. And when I say vibe higher, I’m talking about there is a natural resonating frequency that all energy plays out. And I talk about this in the fourth class a little bit, but astrology is predictable, and the reason it’s predictable is because there’s a low frequency and then there is a spectrum going all the way up to the highest frequency.”
Personal Responsibility:
“And I am not the person to tell you what the highest frequency is, but you know, as different situations come across, and that’s what you have to figure out and what you wanna harness and embrace and manifest with.”
Categories of Toxic Situations to Remove
1. Toxic People:
Family Example:
“And sometimes a family, right? You might have a mom who’s just super toxic, who tells you all the time, like criticizes you all the time and kind of gets in your head. And I’m not saying don’t ever talk to your mom again, but maybe if you talk to her every day, maybe you should limit that to two to three times a week or something along that, that you can kind of manage that stress and whatnot.”
Romantic Relationships:
“If it’s a toxic relationship, maybe you’re at a precipice where you have to make a choice whether it’s right for you to move forward or if there’s something you can work on within the relationship so you can both move forward or if it’s time for you to exit and do things for yourself and harness that Aries energy.”
Friends:
“This includes friends; it includes a work situation.”
2. Toxic Work Situations:
“It’s not always people; sometimes, at work, it’s not the people, it’s the job itself that you just don’t like. There’s a component of it that just doesn’t feel fulfilling.”
3. Toxic Relationship with Money:
“Sometimes it’s your relationship with money. Sometimes you chase things that you shouldn’t chase, and you need to bring it back a little bit and say, you know, it’s okay to want money; it’s okay to do things to achieve money. But if your relationship with money is poor, then that is a toxic situation where money comes in and you spend it right away. That is something that you have to address.”
Warning Against Extremism:
“And that’s not to say go the other way and become an extremist, because that’s opposite your energy most likely, and that’s a drastic change that’s really unnecessary. Just having a better relationship within your energies to understand yourself will help immensely.”
The Cycle Recognition
Understanding Repeating Patterns:
Direct Quote:
“And more importantly, something that’s maybe a little more abstract, toxic cycles. When things happen, they run their course; we hit an ending, we come back to the beginning, we do it all over again. You notice in your lifetime, you have cycles because if you look at your chart, planets sit in a certain place and they sit in a certain order. And as events come and transits come, they always go this way. In perpetual motion, they move forward.”
Breaking the Cycle:
“And yeah, we get a chance through some retrogrades, but it has to hit that planet in order for us to snap out of it if we’re not cognizant of the fact that astrology exists. And you’re in this class, which means you know it exists.”

THE FIVE CRITICAL PLANETS FOR MANIFESTATION
Introduction to the Framework
Expanding the Big Three:
Direct Quote:
“When you’re looking at your chart, Chiron, understanding your wounds, understanding your insecurities, and the things that hold you back within your own psyche is extremely important. I always talk about this. I’m adding two planets to this; there are five planets that I think you need to pay attention to in order to manifest properly. Three of them I always talk about; Chiron, again, is one.”
The Five:
                              1. Chiron
                              2. Moon
                              3. Neptune
                              4. Pluto
                              5. Sun
PLANET 1: CHIRON - The Wound
Definition & Astronomical Note:
Direct Quote:
“And in astrology, I understand Chiron, which has been back and forth, demoted, promoted to a dwarf planet, a small planet, whatever it was, an asteroid, a comet, whatever it is, it’s out there. And in astrology, we call it a planet.”
Purpose for Manifestation:
Direct Quote:
“So Chiron is huge, huge because if you’re looking for your limitations and you want to go beyond those limitations, then you need to understand what’s holding you back in the first place.”
Key Function:
                              * Identifies psychological wounds
                              * Shows insecurities
                              * Reveals what holds you back
                              * Indicates where healing is needed before manifestation can occur
Manifestation Application:
 You cannot manifest beyond your wounds until you acknowledge and work with them. Chiron shows WHERE the block is and WHAT type of healing is required.
PLANET 2 & 3: MOON & NEPTUNE - The Fears
Why Grouped Together:
Direct Quote:
“The next two I’m going to group together because they do have similarities in the context of what I’m speaking, and that is the moon, which I talk about constantly, and Neptune. Both of these planets revolve around fear.”
The Two Types of Fear:
Moon Fears (Conditioned):
“You have to know what your limitations are, which include what you are afraid of, your intuition, and your family and your soul level fears, the ones that come from your family, your upbringing, your conditioning, your emotions versus the things you don’t know…”
Neptune Fears (Abstract):
“…and the things you’re afraid of because you feel like either you’re going to lose it or you don’t know enough about it to achieve it.”
The Critical Distinction:
“And you have to address both of those fears because one of them comes from conditioning and the other one comes from abstractness. And both of them are based off of fear…”
Overlapping Planetary Functions - Advanced Concept
The Actor/Actress Example:
Direct Quote:
“And this is why a lot of times we talk about in the energies of different planets that different planets mean different things. And some of them have a little bit of overlap to the other one. Like if I’m looking at the chart of an actor or an actress, oftentimes I will see both Neptune and Jupiter have a prominent role, and it’s not because they’re co-rulers or anything like that. It’s because in different ways they have certain traits that overlap within the theatrical experience.”
Neptune’s Contribution:
“One of them has to do with fantasy, the media, and film, and things of that nature with the creativity that’s expressed.”
Jupiter’s Contribution:
“And the other one has to do with storytelling, experiences, and philosophy that can create a good storyteller who creates believable stories in a fantasy, fictitious, you know, liberally speaking way.”
Result:
“Both of those go hand in hand when it comes to creative people who are in the film industry.”
Implication for Manifestation:
 Multiple planets can contribute to the same goal through different energetic channels. Understanding which energies overlap helps you activate multiple chart areas toward one manifestation target.
Moon vs. Neptune - The Subconscious Distinction
Neptune as Subconscious:
“The Neptune is also your subconscious, and you do have to be aware of your subconscious traits and behaviors, patterns and habits.”
Function:
 Addresses fears about:
                              * What you don’t know
                              * What you might lose
                              * Abstract uncertainties
                              * Creative blocks
                              * Illusions and delusions
Manifestation Application:
 Neptune shows where you need to develop faith, creativity, and overcome fear of the unknown. Moon shows emotional patterns inherited from family that need reprogramming.
PLANET 4: PLUTO - The Power
Deep Psychology vs. Subconscious:
Direct Quote:
“But Pluto is deep down; it’s things you bottled up. It’s things that kind of stir inside, and you do not want these things coming out. You have to address Pluto and really get in tune with your inner self, the deep hidden parts of you that you don’t share with everybody else, the secrets.”
The Inner Work Required:
“And you have to come to terms with all this because Pluto is also personal power. It is inner power. It is regenerative, I can’t say that word, regenerative properties that you have. It is the Phoenix…”
The Failure Requirement
Critical Manifestation Truth:
Direct Quote:
“…and anytime you’re talking about manifestation, you have to realize that you have to also be okay with failure, because anytime you’re achieving something, I guarantee you, you didn’t get it on the first try. If you did, nice stroke of luck, but every single time is not gonna happen that way.”
Redefining Failure:
“Failure, true failure, means you fell down and you never got back up; that’s the mindset. Anyone who is successful has failed numerous times.”
The Smart Failure Process:
“The smart failures are the people who look at how they failed, why they failed. They take the stuff that did not cause them to fail and they keep it, they take the stuff that did cause that failure and change it, so they’re not starting from scratch, they’re not abandoning, they’re moving forward by tweaking the things that did not work so that they can achieve the success that they’re looking for.”
Pluto as Core Manifestation Energy
The Phoenix Principle:
“But Pluto is that inner power; it is that regeneration, it is that strive, that obsession, and that manifestation requires obsession, because it’s the thing you want.”
Reality Check:
“It’s not a genie; it’s not three wishes in a lamp. You don’t just wake up one day and say, there it is, that’s what I wanted, I got it.”
Scale Acknowledgment:
“Now, there are little things that you can manifest; you can really spend time thinking about something, driving something really small, but a lot of the things we wanna manifest are huge, especially if any of us are dreamers. I know I’m a dreamer; I know everything that I wanna do is grand scale.”
Working with Your Energy Type
Different Approaches for Different Charts:
Capricorn Energy:
“And some people will tell you you have to take a step at a time, do it little by little and whatnot, and I’m just like no that doesn’t vibe with me I don’t do things little at a time. I take huge leaps, and that is part of Leo. I’m a Leo rising, that’s part of my energy. Your energy may be Capricorn; you may have to set milestones, you may have to go slow and steady.”
Virgo Energy:
“If you have Virgo, you have to go service to others; it has to be a daily thing, a routine, and you have to be careful that you’re not overly criticizing yourself.”
Leo Energy (Instructor’s Example):
“Every single, and then back to Leo, Leo is about risk-taking; risk is a Leo trait. And the inner child and the things you want, and almost that innocence, but that untested worldly ambition that you can have that fire that literally lights inside you, say I’m not happy unless I have this, that’s Leo.”
Universal Principle:
“Every single sign in the zodiac has something that will help you grab onto and move forward with, and then the aspects and everything else, so that’s extremely important.”
Pluto as Magnetism
The Power Dynamics:
Direct Quote:
“Pluto is your power. If you wanna know where you’ll be powerful, if you wanna know where your magnetism is, that’s Pluto.”
Life as a Popularity Contest
The Controversial Truth:
Direct Quote:
“If you’re looking for success, life is a popularity contest, and people hate when I say that, but prove me wrong. Life is a popularity contest. People have to like you if you’re selling something; people have to like you if you wanna be seen.”
Examples:
                              * Actor: “If you’re an actor, if people don’t like you, they don’t wanna watch your movies.”
                              * Sales: “If you’re selling a product, if you’re selling a house and you’re the realtor and they don’t like you, they’re either not gonna buy the house or they’re gonna get rid of you and replace you in the process of buying whatever house it is.”
The Game Recognition:
“It’s a popularity contest, and you gotta figure out your way in there because that is also part of manifestation, is understanding the game. No one talks about that part: the game. You’re a chess piece on a chess board.”
Strategic Awareness:
“If you don’t understand the game or the ways that you can play it or the ways you can manipulate the system, then you’re gonna be that pawn that gets swiped off at the beginning, and you’re gonna have to play the game starting from scratch again, and it’s just gonna keep going; you’re gonna be in that cycle.”
The Power Choice
Critical Warning:
Direct Quote:
“Pluto is your power. If you do not harness Pluto, it’s everyone else’s power, and it becomes your chaos.”
This is arguably one of the most important statements in the entire class - Pluto energy WILL manifest. The question is whether YOU control it or it controls you.
PLANET 5: THE SUN - The Vitality
The Paradox:
Direct Quote:
“The final planet is what I would believe is the most obvious planet; it is in all social media, it’s in all pop culture astrology, everybody talks about this planet, but nobody uses it, and that is the sun.”
Core Functions:
Direct Quote:
“The sun is your vitality; the sun is your risk; the sun is what keeps you moving, keeps you alive and pushes you forward. It’s your creative expression in your inner child, right? We talk about this in the first or second class, or both of them.”
Why It’s Neglected:
Direct Quote:
“The sun is so important, but most people get hung up on all of the intricacies of the real world because the sun is not part of the real world. The sun is life; it’s why it rules children. You brought that into the world, but it’s also your happiness because it’s your vitality; it’s literally that fire inside you.”
Common Manifestation Mistakes
Looking in Wrong Places:
Direct Quote:
“So, wherever your sun is, wherever your Leo placements are, wherever you’re, what’s in your fifth house, all of that is extremely important; but people neglect it. They look for their midheaven when sometimes we don’t even use that, or they look for the 10th house or their second house, and they’re like, oh, I need to make money, my second house in Venus, and they start there.”
The Incomplete Manifestation:
“That’s great, but if you don’t incorporate the rest of it, you’re not gonna be happy. And you could be wealthy, but you won’t be happy. And we need the full package.”
The Nobody Said That Moment
Cultural Reference:
Direct Quote:
“Manifestation, nobody manifests to be rich and depressed; we don’t do that. I actually was listening to a song at the gym earlier today, and I sent the lyrics to my buddy because I vibe heavily with like a certain section of the song, and it’s a little crass. But there’s one part that ends the verse that says, yeah, I wanna be broke forever. Yeah, that’s that ish that no one ever said, right?”
The Balance Required:
“But we can wanna manifest money, we can wanna manifest abundance, happiness, a partner, the dream job, a place that we live. There’s anything. You can really manifest almost anything within the energy and the parameters of what you have. But if you only chase after that, Taylor got it. If you only chase after that, you are not gonna be happy because you are neglecting your sun sign…”
Sun’s Connections Matter
Integrated Analysis Required:
Direct Quote:
“…and your sun sign has connections, aspects. We talked about that in a previous class, and it has a position. It has a degree and a Deccan, and it has a house placement. You have to see where it is, and you have to look at your progressions because through time it changes.”
Natal vs. Progressed Sun
The Movement Principle:
Direct Quote:
“Your natal chart will always be there, but if you move or if you just get older, it moves. The progressions are based off of one degree per year on your sun, so you can move three to four signs within a lifetime, depending on what degree you started at.”
Application:
“It’s important that you pay attention to all that, and you align your current position Then we’re gonna get into this, and with divine timing, but you align your current position with what’s attainable at the time. And then you focus, and you hyper focus, and you make sure that this is the only thing. And anything that stops me from doing this is gone.”
Mindset Summary:
 Mindset = Clear belief system + toxic elimination + understanding your five key planets (Chiron, Moon, Neptune, Pluto, Sun) + strategic awareness + laser focus on aligned goals.
________________


COMPONENT 2: TRANSMUTATION - THE TECHNICAL PROCESS
Definition & Purpose
Moving Beyond Mindset:
Direct Quote:
“The next stage is transmutation, right? And so now we have the mindset down. We know what we want and it has to be something that is A, attainable. It can be a big thing, but it has to be attainable, and it has to be something that we are willing to put in the workforce, something we really want, not something small, not something trivial.”
Scale Matters:
“You can get those things, sure, you can manifest them, but something you really want, and it can be things that some people don’t believe you could actually have any control over, but you can. So once you have your mindset down, that’s locked, right? So now we can move past mindset. Transmutation, that is the key.”
The Sample Chart: Dolores
Introduction:
Direct Quote:
“So I’m gonna move this on out of the way, and we have Dolores here. Now Dolores is some random woman; she was born in 1979. I don’t know why anyone’s still naming their child Dolores at this point, but she was born May 11th, 1979, in Memphis, Tennessee, at 11:16 a.m. And this is Dolores’ chart. So this is a fictitious person. I just chose some random dates and numbers and whatnot. I plugged it in, and this is Dolores, okay?”
Chart Selection Note:
“Actually, it’s the second attempt because I tried to do somebody from like 1930, and for the purpose of explaining this, there were too many stelliums, and it would take me too long to do. Whenever you see stelliums and satellitiums in a chart, you do have to allow a lot for more time because you have to break down all the energies that are feeding into one source. So, stelliums do add time and effort.”
Dolores’ Chart Basics:
                              * Rising Sign: Leo
                              * Notable Configurations: Multiple groupings of 2-3 planets (manageable)
                              * Purpose: Demonstrate transmutation techniques
TRANSMUTATION DEFINITION
The Core Concept:
Direct Quote:
“But the purpose of transmuting is to understand. Now, we talked about retrogrades in another class, which I will put out soon, which is utilizing retrogrades for positive action. And understanding that the observable backwards motion, which is not real, it is only in perspective of where we are on the planet, creates an influx; or, not influx, a flux in the way the energy hits us. And it works inwardly.”
How Retrogrades Work:
“You can call it backwards because that’s what the planet’s visually doing, but it’s really a flux; it’s an inward thing. So, as that planet, the transits, hit us, it’s causing that energy to go inward and for us to basically do reflection.”
TRANSMUTATION EXAMPLE: Mercury Retrograde
The Traditional Fear:
Direct Quote:
“Now, with transmutation, whether it is retrograde planets, actually, I’ll just stick on that; people talk about Mercury retrogrades all the time as a transit, right? In a previous class, we talked about whether what it would be like in your natal chart, but as transits is what we usually talk about. And people talk all the time about how it’s so bad: communication’s terrible, and contracts are bad, and you shouldn’t sign anything, and your electronics are gonna go crazy, and communication’s gonna get bad, and you’re gonna argue.”
The Reality:
“The first thing is all of that is all dependent on what sign it’s in, what house it’s transiting, what other planets are being aspected. So people generalize Mercury retrograde based off of perceived notions of what may have happened to them or someone they know in the past because of aspects that they were unaware of.”
The Truth About Retrogrades:
“Retrogrades are not bad; retrogrades are really good, actually, because they help re-steer you and change course when you could be hitting an iceberg. Helps you move around.”
TRANSMUTATION IN ACTION: Car Purchase Example
The Scenario:
Direct Quote:
“Transmuting the energy is to say, there’s a retrograde happening; I’m using it for this purpose, but there’s a retrograde happening over my third house. So contracts that have to do with communication, let’s say I’m buying a car; the third house has to do with buying a car.”
The Analysis Process:
“And I look to see how it’s aspecting Venus and whatnot, and I realize that there’s gonna be something wrong with the contract. There’s gonna be something I have to rethink or renegotiate that has to do with buying this car, and I shouldn’t sign the contract, but the difference is I shouldn’t sign that contract the way that it is. Not I shouldn’t sign any contract, right?”
The Transmutation:
“Because I now know that the retrograde is hitting, and this is transmutation. It’s because I know it’s there; I know what it means. And because I know what it means, I know what it could mean, and this is what transmutation is.”
What Does It Mean? The Core Question
Direct Quote:
“What does it mean? How will it play out? The way it plays out is always default. We know that it will play out in its lowest vibration unless you have a bunch of other people who also know astrology, who are changing the energies. It’s still within the confines of whatever that energy means, but it could play out in a higher vibration if somebody else knows.”
Current Reality:
“But at this point in time, not many people know how to transmute energy, so it plays out in its lowest vibrational setting. So you know what’s going to happen; you know there’s gonna be something wrong.”
The Detective Work:
“And if you look at all the aspects at the time of what’s going on, you can figure out exactly what it has to do with: is it something mechanical? Is it something with the car? Is it something to do with the salesperson? Is it something to do with the price? Is it, what is it? And you can figure that out.”
Armed with Knowledge:
“Now that I know. I’m armed; this is knowledge. I can go in there and, on my volition, renegotiate this contract, knowing it needs to be renegotiated anyway. I can’t move forward, so now I have to make the changes, and based off of all the transits and aspects that are happening at the moment, I know what I need to do.”
THE TRANSMUTATION FORMULA
Direct Quote:
“That is what transmutation is: to transmute the energies, meaning to take what was going to happen and make it be something I want to happen within the confines of those energies.”
This is the central technical definition of the entire manifestation system.
________________


DOLORES CHART ANALYSIS: PRACTICAL TRANSMUTATION
Starting Focus: Money
Why Money First:
Direct Quote:
“So how do the energies play out and why? Now, I’m going to hold off on transits, even though I use that in the example because that’s more about divine timing. I’m going to use natal energies, I’m going to see how does this stuff play out specifically here, right? I’m going to start with money because money, money, and love are the two main topics everyone wants to know, because they, they revolve their entire life around these two things…”
Reality Check:
“…even though they are not everything, they are literally two twelfths, one sixth of your life, those two things. And that’s only if you give one thing to each house, it’s so much. And people put so much stock in relationships and so much stock in money.”
Balanced Perspective:
“And yes, partnership is wonderful; your energies may actually support or promote that. Money is needed and necessary. Not everybody wants to be a billionaire; not everybody wants to be partnered. And we have to respect that when you’re doing readings as well by staying objective.”
The Analysis Process
Starting Point:
Direct Quote:
“But this is all about how do my energy sits in my chart; how does it normally play out? And I know that because of the lowest vibrational setting; how can it play out? What do all these energies mean and what are the different things based off of brainstorming? Because that’s basically what you’re doing when you’re transmuting energy.”
The Shift from Forcing to Working With:
“Instead of saying, I need to force the energy to do this, you say, here’s what’s going to happen; here’s the energies; here’s like a ballpark of what I would like to happen. And then you dive into the energy, into the glyphs, into the aspects, and everything that’s sitting here and say, how can I change this to do something different? How can I use it myself?”
How to Use Planetary Energies
Direct Application:
Direct Quote:
“Using the energies is not something you need to like teach yourself or focus on. You can literally just, if it’s Mars, you can literally act or react; or do, if it is Saturn, you can focus. If it is Neptune, you can dream or be creative. If it is the sun, you can harness that confidence. You can use those powers for yourself. If it is Pluto, you can have that inner understanding and that transmuting and fixation on something kind of like Uranus, where you can say, this is what it is; this is how I want to change it.”
Selective Transmutation
Don’t Fix What Isn’t Broken:
Direct Quote:
“And we want to use the energies differently. Some of them we don’t; some of them we’re like, you know what? Leave that alone because that’s great. But over here, there’s one thing, and that’s a big thing too: sometimes the energies all play out nicely except one or two things, and you’re like, I just need to change these two things so that they don’t play out poorly and they play out in my benefit.”
THE ONE-WAY ENERGY LAW
Critical Technical Principle:
Direct Quote:
“And I want to also to make this point here: energies cannot manifest two different ways at the same time, which means if you are using the energy, it can’t do something else because you are telling the energy at what vibration to resonate.”
This is one of the most important technical concepts in the system - energy exclusivity. If you consciously direct an energy, it cannot simultaneously manifest in its default/negative way.
Dolores Chart: Leo Rising Analysis
Physical Appearance Indicators:
Direct Quote:
“Now, I’m not going to do a natal chart here, but I know a couple of things. So I know that Dolores is a Leo rising, so I know kind of what she looks like. I know that the hair is something to look at, whether it’s poofy, curly, big, small, there, not there, or whatever; that’s something that I’ll have to look at.”
Transformation Pattern:
“I know that she goes through stark transformations when she is feeling a certain way or if she needs to present herself in public; that she transforms. How do I know that?”
The Chain of Reasoning:
“I know that because Leo rising, the ruler is the sun, and the sun is opposite Uranus in Scorpio. Now, a couple of things that you can do with this, right? One is I know that that’s kind of how it goes, but I also know that she can go through like huge transformations based off of this…”
Bringing in 12th House:
“…and bring in the 12th house ruler, which is Cancer, which is the moon over here, which is in here as well. So if this person knowing that, let’s just say because Leo is film and entertainment, it’s not film as much as it’s entertainment stage, you know, things that are fun, recreation, sports, and whatnot.”
Film Industry Application Example
The Hair Connection:
Direct Quote:
“I know that this person, if they were to go on film and kind of do that, that their hair would be a significant contributor to each character that they would play, right? So that’s the information of how it can play out.”
Subconscious Attachment:
“And I know that this person needs to have input. There’s a subconscious attachment to the changes here and they have to have input because the moon is attached here.”
Detailed Rulership Chain
Student Question & Response:
Question: “How did you get that from the 12th house?”
Answer:
“I have to backtrack a minute. First house was Leo, the rulers of the sun; that’s in the 10th house of public in Taurus, which is the arts. I’m ignoring Chiron for a second. The sun is opposite Uranus; Uranus is conjunct the moon. The moon is the ruler of the 12th house, and the 12th house rules film. The sun, Leo, which is the sun, also rules entertainment. So I’m just combining these with this opposition here, and this is an opposition.”
Natural State:
“So this person does not do this normally unless they need to bring in that 12th house energy. So what if, hair from one, film from 12, yes?”
The Stage Fright Problem
Scenario Without Transformation:
Direct Quote:
“So what if I need this person to be in their natural state to? Or what if, not me, let’s say it’s them; let’s say they want to take a role, but they can’t go through a transformation. The role actually calls for them as they look the way they normally look. How would they do that?”
The Chiron Issue:
“Well, theres an insecurity that has to do with their hair and their presence. Also, being in groups and wheres Virgo and the money thats attached or the value. And the value could be also attached to public image.”
Self-Worth Connection:
“So this person wants a strong public image; they want a strong appearance, and they are very self-conscious and insecure about it. They have their own self-worth issues that came from the father, and perhaps the father didnt have much money, and that resonated heavily; that drives this person forward.”
The Conflict:
“But now they’re taking a role, let’s say it’s entertainment film, and they want to use, like I said, their exact thing. Well, they have to use the energy that they have here. Now, Chiron here is insecurity, and if they do not use this transformation and they don’t use all of this energy here, Chiron will naturally show itself. That insecurity will come out.”
Default Outcome:
“They will either not take the role or push against the role, or they will show up, and when they do it, the insecurity will highlight, and they will likely not get the job unless that’s what the role calls for; it’s like an insecure person, right”
TRANSMUTATION SOLUTION: Commercial Example
Working with What You Have:
Direct Quote:
“So, in order to transmute the energies and not have it be here, you have to look at what each of these means. So, we know that we have the chart ruler, we know we have the sun. The sun is vitality, it’s children, it’s whatnot. So, this person can do a role that has to do with art, that has to do with money, it has to do with finance, maybe those things there, and how they can fix it.”
Capital One Commercial Example:
“So, that role, even if the role itself has nothing to do with, let’s say, it’s a Capital One commercial, right? And it’s like credit repair, right? So, this would make sense. She’d take this role and she would fixate; she would focus in on the fact that you’re fixing people’s money, you’re fixing people’s money, you’re fixing people’s money.”
Balancing the Opposition:
“And then for the time being, because it is in opposition, we’re gonna let go of this side of the opposition, or we’re going to balance in here. I’m going to make friends with the women that are there, and I’m going to use that to kind of hold on to it. Now that’s easy since we already have credit repair as a part of it.”
Food Commercial Example (Ragu)
Random But Perfect:
Direct Quote:
“But let’s say it’s a pasta commercial; it’s like a ragu or something like that. Well, that was random, but Taurus does rule food. So what do we have to do in order to do this?”
Mercury Analysis:
“Well, we have to realize that Mercury, I swear I picked this randomly, Mercury right here that’s sitting there rules communication. That’s good for talking, speaking, public, whatever. We have to realize that it rules siblings, cousins, coworkers, and that it also rules sales, right?”
The Mental Frame:
“So we may have to set up a scenario in our head that we have to help the 10th house, the company sell this through our performance and act like, you know, with a fake family.”
Using Scorpio 4th House:
“And maybe that’s an option, is that they can have a fake family, and then there they will make either, they’ll, you know, try to make deep bonds with them or try to find out something secret about the other person to kind of help their character.”
Pulling It Together:
“And that will help them here, kind of pull all this together because they’re using Taurus instead of money, instead of whatnot, they’re using it as food. They’ll probably be drawn to it anyway, but the Chiron, you don’t want the insecurity, so you have to use the healing. And that’s what all transmutation is about.”
The Mental Framework Process
Creating the Narrative:
Direct Quote:
“I know that if I go somewhere and I’m out in public, Chiron is going to impact me in a very negative way. I have, astrology is perception, it’s perspective. I have to use this and develop the scenario in my head and even tell myself, even speak it out loud, right? Because it’s public image.”
Using Sun’s Ego:
“I am selling Ragu because you can’t; maybe not too much ego, but the sun is ego. And if you use the sun’s positive traits, which are humor and joking and all the entertainment, you can come across as someone who is like, I am your sales rep. I am the one who’s going to fix your brand. I’m gonna make sure everybody buys this, blah, blah, blah.”
Focusing on Chiron:
“And you’re gonna focus on the Chiron here, so you’re using all of this energy here and pulling it all together as opposed to how it would have normally played out, which is I show up and my stage fright shows in. The stage fright cannot be a part of it if you want to nail this; if you want to get this audition; if you want to get this role, if it’s film-based.”
Family/Friends Energy Balance
Student Question: “How did you get, not fake, well, make friends even if they’re not?”
Answer:
“So, in the film industry, when you show up on set, there are people there; you can make friends. Uranus rules friendship, so since the sun is opposite, you want to bring this together; you want to balance this here. So, you want to balance; you want to bring in family and friends. You can bring these two energies here and be like the friends are extended family and it’s someone else’s family. And you can play that role and you can bring that in. That would be the best way to do it.”
Solo Scenario:
“If you’re solo, if you’re doing this role and you’re solo, there is no fake family here. Then what you’ll end up having to do is use this energy in a different way. So I would have to use a fourth house, Scorpio, either a very deep embedded memory or thought of your family that no one else knows, something very secret, deep in your psychology.”
Alternative Method:
“Or the easier way is to use someone else’s family because Scorpio is other people’s stuff. It’s the fourth house, which is family or homes. Use other people’s stuff in something that happened randomly and just think of that and use that. That would be the best way to do it. Or picture a future. Picture a future, like someone else’s family in the future because you’re using this.”
Acknowledgment of Method
Direct Quote:
“And I know some of this sounds like erratic and out of base or whatnot, but I promise you it works. It’s like a distorted affirmations, right? Affirmations are set things that you focus on so that you can achieve the things that you want.”
The Difference:
“With astrology, these energies are present, and these energies play out a certain way. You do not want this off and on again based off of your fears because this is stage fright. This could be stage fright, like deep stage fright. You don’t want this to play out. In order to overcome it, you have to use that energy in a different way.”

STUDENT-DIRECTED TRANSMUTATION: TRAVEL
Opening It Up
Direct Quote:
“So that’s one scenario. So I want to open it up to you guys real quick that are in the live class here, and you can pick any topic. Well, this is a real test for me, by the way, because this is a random person. You can pick any topic, and you can say, you know, this person, they want to do this with their life.”
Options Given:
“So, like I said, I’ll open it up to you guys; just choose something. It can be love, it can be money, it can be career, it can be anything. And then I will show you with this chart how they could attain the thing that you’re looking for, or if they can’t attain that, how they can attain something that does align with their energies.”
Student Request: “This person wants to travel.”
9th House Analysis
Starting Assessment:
Direct Quote:
“This person wants to travel. Perfect. Well, the beautiful thing with this is that their ninth house ruler is in the ninth house, so this is a good one. It’s not necessarily an easy one, but there’s a good start here.”
Natural Inclination:
“This person has the opportunity to travel, wants to travel, and enjoys traveling for the sake of doing so. Now, here’s the key: there is both Aries, Mars, which is the ruler here, and Venus and Juno here.”
Conflicting Energies Identified
The Problem:
Direct Quote:
“Now, if you think about what these energies actually signify, that means there’s a solo type of energy in here and a couple’s partners type of energy in here. So I’ve got conflicting energy. So this is actually a really good example because from the base, it’s like, okay, they travel, they wanna travel, and they travel for the sake of traveling, which is great.”
The Partnership Element:
“When they wanna travel, they do it. But then we have this partnership, and we have the Vesta that’s in there as well, which is that spark of life here.”
Default Manifestation
How It Normally Plays Out:
Direct Quote:
“The first thing we always do is we go in, we see what would normally happen here. Well, the first thing is they likely travel with partners, and they like to explore brand new places, right? Because we have two indications here, usually someone that they’re really, really close to or somebody that is a romantic partner of sorts, and they like to do it in luxury.”
Luxury Preference:
“So, they probably like to go first class, especially if they’ve never done first class before; they like to do first class. If they’ve never, there’s a sense of adventure here, so maybe it’s like they wanna travel and skydive with this Aries Mars energy here over Hawaii or something along those lines, right?”
Mercury Spillover
10th House Influence:
Direct Quote:
“We also have Mercury in the 10th house at one degree, which means that’s spilling over with the rest of this into the ninth house, so authority, public image; they like to be seen, they like to be out. They’re not trying to go to a hotel and to some hidden place.”
Nature Component:
“Nature is very important to where they go, so Hawaii, again, lines up with it, but they wanna be there. So Honolulu, as opposed to like one of the smaller islands. And again, nature as well.”
Chiron Note:
“Chiron’s there, I’m going to ignore Chiron for the sake of this; I’m just gonna keep it moving, keep it moving.”
Aspect Analysis
Mars at 26 Degrees:
Direct Quote:
“So we have the ruler of the ninth house here; we know that it’s at 26 degrees. Lilith, this is interesting, a trine with Lilith. Lilith is that raw sexual power; that raw, and Aries is also sex as well. So this person could enjoy getting a little freaky deaky out there when they go on vacation, like they like to do it as a romantic kind of gesture.”
Entertainment Focus:
“Adventure and romance would be a huge part of this, and they really wanna do something where they can have a lot of fun and have a lot of entertainment, and that entertainment, again, is out there. They like to eat good food…”
Health Warning:
“…but they do have to be careful with this Chiron, which I said I was gonna ignore, but they have to be careful with this Chiron that they do not eat the wrong things because they could have like structural issues when it comes to food and whatnot, and they could have reactions; they just have to make sure that they are good with that.”
The Financial Challenge
Square to Part of Fortune:
Direct Quote:
“29, so we have a square to the part of fortune; so they probably like to spend a lot of money, which means they, in order to vacation. Now this is actually really good to understand; so they like to vacation places and they like to live in luxury and kind of do things like that. But we have a square here between Mars and the part of fortune.”
Juno Involvement:
“And then we have a sextile. Here to Polis now, we also have Juno at 28 degrees, which means when you combine these two, it has to do with requiring both people to have money and work for it to be able to do that.”
TRANSMUTATION SOLUTION: Career Alignment
The Smart Path:
Direct Quote:
“Now, if they’re smart then they’ll take this energy, and they will know they’ll take it further into Saturn in their second house. We have the North Node there, so this won’t be easy at first, but they’ll take this energy, and that will tie back into their career, and they will position themselves in a in a place of in a place of power in a lead role or something along those lines where they are able to make the type of money they want.”
Business Options:
“Either they’re an entrepreneur or They are they work with their partner or they do something along those lines, and they build something, right? That’s the best way for this person to do it, and that’s part of the transmuting because there’s the conflict here between these two energies here and the part of fortune, which means it’s expensive. It’s a lot of money for them to go, and their work may not pay enough.”
The Solution:
“So, in order to change this career and that square, they either need to put in more hours, which some people do, or they need to develop a career that will support, you know, the different things that they want to do, that has some element of service involved. So, that’s how you handle that square.”
Speed Note:
“I did that really quickly, but that’s transmuting that energy. Use that square to build; realize that this doesn’t have to be a problem.”

ALCHEMISTIC ASTROLOGY - CLASS 5: TIME TO MANIFEST (CONTINUED)
Complete Knowledge Extraction - Part 2
________________


COMPONENT 3: DIVINE TIMING - THE TEMPORAL DIMENSION
Introduction to Timing
Direct Quote:
“And that is the key to everything we’re doing here with the time to manifest, and then the whole transits part is the timing, the divine timing. We’re going to get to that towards the end.”
The Structure:
“I’m going to spend a little bit of time on transmutation, I’m going to let you guys ask some questions, and then we’re just going to kind of, you know, make our way through this.”
Father Time: Saturn
The Most Important Transit Planet:
Direct Quote:
“So we’ve talked about mindset, we’ve talked about transmutation, and now we need to talk about the divine timing portion, right? And the divine timing has to do with transits and using the transits. Now, there is a planet that is referred to as Father Time, and that is the planet Saturn. Saturn is the most important, in my opinion, planet outside of the moon, but the moon is on a daily level.”
Why Saturn Matters:
Direct Quote:
“To understand what the restrictions are, where your focus is gonna be, and the hardships, restrictions, or anything that is gonna come up that is going to be significant for your long-term goals and your future, Saturn. And then you align with these transits, you move it, you find the dates.”
Current Transit Example (Live Class)
Saturn in 8th House Transit:
Direct Quote:
“So, right now, if I go to this chart, this is actually if, this is an important one for this chart. We don’t have the exact time that this class is being, actually we do. Hold on a second. Let me go to extended chart selection. I can actually just pull up from when this broadcast started. So let me do that real quick.”
Setting Up the Chart:
“April 3rd, 2021, eastern time, so that was 5 p.m. Eastern, so that was like 4 p.m. Central, Memphis, Tennessee. Let’s see what’s actually going on here.”
The Analysis:
Direct Quote:
“Okay, so we see Saturn is going over the eighth house. The eighth house has to do with shared resources, other people’s money, intimacy, deep bonds, sex. It also, oh gosh, I keep forgetting it, it also has to do with, of course, death. Not in the sense that you’re gonna die, but endings, right? Cycles, things, and tax, taxes, and debt.”
Lowest Vibration Warning
How Saturn Naturally Manifests:
Direct Quote:
“So, if we’re talking about Dolores here, if Dolores is not aware of the fact that there is a Saturn transit happening over her eighth house for the next two and a half years, okay, if she’s not aware of that, then she can anticipate that there’s gonna be a lot of restriction on all of these things that I just mentioned.”
The Negative Possibilities:
“She could have issues with debt, she could have issues in the bedroom, she could have issues with intimacy with her partner because Saturn is like cold, it’s structured and orderly and business-like. So there’s that potential. Taxes could be a huge burden.”
Additional Concerns:
“And if she has any sort of, you know, her parents are getting up in age, you know, she could be looking at something happening with a parent or somebody close to her, a grandparent, or if there’s a divorce or anything along those lines, or a breakup, then there could be a separation of assets.”
Highest Vibration Opportunity
The Transmutation:
Direct Quote:
“So let’s take this and put it on the other side. Saturn’s all about goals, and using it in a higher vibration, its goals are in a lower vibration, it’s restriction. So it can be restriction on all these things, and naturally, it will play out.”
But…
“If you’re aware of it and you are transmuting it and you’re manifesting with it, you are saying, ‘Okay, my goal is to pay off my debt. My goal is to handle my taxes early.’ If you have a business, ‘My goal is to get a CPA,’ you know, ‘or get an accountant and structure my financials.’”
Intimacy Application:
“‘My goal is to have structured, regular intimacy with my partner where we sit down and we plan this out so that we’re not going through a drought,’ right? Because that’s what Saturn can do.”
Legacy Building:
“‘My goal is to build a legacy because the eighth house has legacy. My goal is to receive an inheritance.’ Maybe from a parent. ‘My goal is to set up my will or my trust fund or whatever I need to do.’ All of these things you can use because you’re using the Saturn energy. You’re not allowing it to control you.”
The Action Requirement
Critical Point:
Direct Quote:
“If you don’t do anything with it, it’s gonna play out in a lower vibration, and these are the things that are gonna happen because that’s how energy plays out. But if you harness it, if you use it, then it becomes what you want it to be, and it plays out in your favor.”
The Power of Knowledge:
“And now that you know it’s happening, you can get ahead of it. And instead of it feeling like you’re reacting to circumstance, you’re actually going and creating the circumstance. That’s transmutation, that’s manifestation, that’s divine timing, all three together.”
________________


COMPREHENSIVE Q&A SECTION
Question 1: Communication and Stage Presence
Student Question:
“Does that mean this person can choose to communicate in a certain way to help with their stage presence?”
Instructor Answer:
“Yes, the answer to that question is yes. And if you need elaboration, just let me know. But yes, they can use the ruler of Mercury; Mercury is communication. So if they are using their… what house does it rule? What does Mercury rule? Mercury rules both the second house and the 11th house.”
Application:
“So they would have to use the energy of like, ‘I am representing my friends. I am out here with my squad.’ And then whenever you say things like that, like I said, it may sound silly, it may sound like, you know, childish or whatever, but it works because you’re pulling the energy and you’re making it resonate at a different frequency.”
Alternative Approach:
“Or ‘I need to make money from this; I need to sell this product; I need to bring value to this product.’ So you’re talking about your values and you’re using this energy here. So you pull all of this energy together by using the chart ruler opposite the moon, which rules 12, but the moon is in the fourth. So you’re also now pulling fourth house energy into that as well.”
The Result:
“So all of these energies, it’s like a web, are all pulling into this one moment to give you the outcome that you want, which is to use all this energy but not have the Chiron as the staple.”
Question 2: Relationship Interpretation
Student Observation:
“If we were to look at Dolores’s relationships, Dolores, her seventh house ruler is conjunct the moon, opposing the sun in the 10th house. Correct. I see that as the relationships may have the tendency to be public, but there may be some fears about it being public because it may change the emotional connection. This is my deepest shot at interpretation so far.”
Instructor Response:
“That’s really good. I would say that this is one of the things that would trigger these transformations that we talked about is romantic relationships because Venus and Juno are both there. And it has, this opposition here has to do with that. So, spot on. Yes.”
Additional Layer:
“Now the only thing I would add to that is because I, this is what I do. So when I look at this, the ruler is Aquarius, so Uranus here opposing the sun. So what happens is this is public; what happens is very erratic.”
The Pattern:
“It’s like very erratic, changes happen out of nowhere. They happen, there’s upheaval, like one day things are fine; next day, like, for no reason at all, things are not. And then it kind of adds some conflict within the house because the ruler isn’t just Venus in the ninth; the ruler is also Venus in the ninth square Neptune or semi-sextile Neptune in the third.”
The Publicity Angle:
“So there’s gossip happening, so people are talking, her relationships are public even though she doesn’t want them to be. This is like that fear or that loss of like, this isn’t what I wanted.”
Early Life Influence:
“And if we trace it back to the ruler, again, the moon in the fourth, that comes from childhood, right? So maybe she watched her parents have a very volatile, public relationship that she didn’t want. Or she watched her parents be very private, and it worked out, so she wanted that for herself.”
The Manifestation Problem:
“And now she’s in this position where she’s trying to be private because of the 12th energy, but it’s very difficult to be that way because of Mercury here, and she has no choice over the spontaneous nature of these relationships that, it’s like there’s always something. And the things that happen are, you know, kind of childlike and creative, but they’re also, they can sting a little bit, you know, because Uranus stings.”
Question 3: Empty 8th House
Student Question:
“What if someone has an empty eighth house?”
Instructor Answer:
“The ruler. So if you have an empty eighth house, what rules your eighth house? And then wherever that ruler is, you take that energy and you place it into the eighth house.”
Example:
“So let me just do this real quick. I’m gonna find, the eighth house is empty, but the eighth house is in Pisces. So Neptune rules it, Neptune’s in the third. So eighth house themes, deep bonds, intimacy, other people’s money, taxes, death, endings, cycles, all of that is very communicative.”
The Interpretation:
“It’s talked about. It’s, there could be legal, you know, when you’re dealing with other people’s money and divorce and separation, you have lawyers. That’s all third house. Communication, lawyers, documents, whatnot. And it’s in Sagittarius, so it’s also legal, justice, you know, truth. So you take those energies and you say, okay, this is how this plays out.”
Ruler Aspects:
“And then you go to look at Neptune itself, how is it aspected? And if Neptune is well aspected or if it’s ill aspected, you know, then you’ll know that the eighth house will actually play out pretty nicely, or it could be really rough.”
Question 4: Virgo & Pisces Manifestation
Student Question:
“I’m a Virgo rising, Pisces moon, and currently my Saturn is opposing my sun. How would you recommend I manifest right now?”
Instructor Answer - Part 1:
“Okay, so Saturn opposing the sun. So you’re probably either 14-15 or you’re closer to that 43-44, somewhere in there because I believe it’s a 28, 29 or 30-year cycle around there.”
The Opposition Meaning:
“So what this means is that you are being restricted from your own, what you want to do, your own vitality, your own energy. You’re, it’s like you are unable to push forward. You’re stuck, you feel stifled by what’s actually in front of you. And some of that is coming from either an authority figure or your own career or your own career path or something along those lines.”
The Transmutation:
“The reason, well, there’s a lot of reasons why we can go down a rabbit hole with this, but the fact that it’s an opposition, that’s balance. That’s trying to figure out how you can meet this energy in the middle so that you can figure out how to overcome it or use it for your benefit.”
Practical Application:
“So what I would do is I would say, ‘Okay, what is it that I really wanna do? What does my sun mean? Where’s my sun? What does my sun house placement tell me that I wanna do? What is it that I want to do?’ And then Saturn’s over here somewhere, so what does Saturn mean? Where’s Saturn? What house is Saturn in? Okay, that’s the structure or the restriction. How can I build on what I want that has to do with this thing over here?”
Example Scenario:
“So maybe your sun is in your ninth house and you wanna travel and Saturn is in your third and it’s like, I can’t afford to travel. Well, you go local. You do short trips. You do like traveling to like, you know, for me, I’m in Texas, so I would say like, I can’t go to, you know, Australia, but I can go to like San Antonio or Austin or Dallas or Houston or whatever and experience those things.”
The Build-Up:
“Or I can focus on making the money so that once this Saturn transit is over, I now have the money and I have my freedom to go do it. Do you see what I mean? Like you’re building on what you have and you’re using the energy that’s presenting itself to you to move forward once you’re out of the situation.”
Question 5: Spouse Prediction
Student Question:
“Can astrology tell how the spouse will be?”
Instructor Answer:
“Kind of. Not the way that you would think that you would want it to. So I’ll give you the answer to this.”
The Method:
“So the seventh house is the first marriage or first major relationship. And then you go to the opposite; so that’s the ninth house. So you would look at the ninth house to see what kind of partner they are in terms of that relationship.”
Limitations:
“Now, the part that you can’t really nail down is like you’re not gonna get hair color, eye color, how tall they are. Sometimes if there’s a lot of Jupiter and Sagittarius energy, I’ve noticed that they’re athletes. If there’s a lot of like entertainment, sun, Leo, they’re in entertainment.”
What You CAN Determine:
“You can get like what they do for a living sometimes. You can get their qualities and their traits because those energies are still energies that exist within the signs and the placements and everything else, but you can’t get specifics like you would if you were just like a fortune teller or a psychic.”
Why Not:
“That’s not the point of astrology; astrology just tells you the energy. And there are millions of people with the same chart. So if astrology said that you were gonna marry a six-foot-two blue-eyed brunette who’s amazing at basketball, and that there’s a million people who have your chart, you couldn’t all marry the same person. So it doesn’t work like that.”
What’s Realistic:
“But you can say, ‘Hey, I’m gonna, you know, my partner’s gonna be in sports, or they’re gonna be very athletic, or they’re gonna be very competitive, or they’re gonna be argumentative.’ You know, things like that, qualities.”
Question 6: Saturn Return Prep
Student Question:
“What do you do if you’re about to head into your Saturn return? Do you prep for it?”
Instructor Answer:
“Yes, you absolutely can prep for it. So a Saturn return is Saturn returning to where it was when you were born, right? So when the transit is coming back.”
Timing:
“Now it starts kind of with an orb. So if you have your Saturn at, let’s say, 15 degrees, I would start looking at it probably about 10 degrees before. So if it’s in the same sign, 10 degrees before; if it’s in a different sign, I would start watching for it about five degrees into the sign that it’s in, if that makes sense.”
What to Do:
“And what I would do is I would say, ‘What does my Saturn mean to me?’ So where’s Saturn? What does Saturn rule?’ Because that’s where it’s hitting. And then in my natal chart, ‘What house is it in? Okay, that’s hitting this house. So I’m being restricted, or my goals are supposed to be here. What happened the last time Saturn was here?’”
Pattern Recognition:
“So look back, the first Saturn return is at 28, 29, 30, somewhere in there. The second one is around 58, 59, 60. So if you’re at your first one, you look back to the year you were born.”
The Analysis:
“And you say, ‘What was going on? What was happening?’ And you look around, you do research on, you know, whether it’s your parents or your own records or whatever, and you see what was happening. And you’ll know exactly how that energy played out in the lower vibration.”
Transmuting for Higher Vibration:
“And that is you deciding, ‘I don’t want that to happen to me when I’m coming into my Saturn return.’ So now I know the house, I know the energies, I know my patterns, I know the themes, and I need to change them now.”
Early Action:
“So I would start doing it as soon as you know it’s coming. Don’t wait until it’s already happening. Because when it starts happening, usually that’s when you’re in reaction mode. And we’re all in reaction mode at that point.”
Proactive Strategy:
“But if you are doing it before and you’re in action mode, then you can set goals now and you can get a head start so that when Saturn comes, you’re already ahead of the curve and you’re already manifesting it at a higher vibration.”
Question 7: Debt and Saturn Transit
Student Question:
“For example, on the debt topic, should we pay off as much debt as possible with this Saturn in the eighth house?”
Instructor Answer:
“Absolutely, yes. If you, so okay, Dolores has Saturn in her second house natally. So she’s always going to have to pay attention to her money; she’s always gonna have to structure her money.”
The Transit Layer:
“When Saturn transits the eighth house, yes, you need to pay down your debt because Saturn’s gonna bring something up about it. Whether it’s you need a loan and you don’t qualify 'cause your debt’s too high, or somebody’s gonna come after you for that debt, or, you know, whatever, you’re gonna have to make monthly payments or something, I don’t know.”
The Outcome:
“But if you pay down your debt before Saturn gets there, then when Saturn is in your eighth house and it’s all about that, you’re debt-free, there’s no stress. Saturn’s like, ‘Cool, good job.’ And you move on with your life. You’re not, you didn’t react to Saturn; Saturn actually helped you because you saw it coming.”
Manifestation Example:
“And then what you can do is you can be like, ‘Alright, now that I’m not paying my debt, that money, I’m gonna put it here and I’m gonna save it, I’m gonna invest it,’ which is all eighth house. And now you’re manifesting money that is yours, but it was really other people’s money that you were paying down and now you don’t have to, so now it’s yours.”
Question 8: Finding the Chart
Student Question:
“So to see this on the astro.com website, what is the chart to choose?”
Instructor Answer:
“So on astro.com, when you want to do your transits, you go to the free horoscopes. Under free horoscopes, you can either go into the extended chart selection and change the type of chart; there’s a drop-down, and it says transits.”
Alternative Method:
“Or there’s another way to do it. You can go, I believe it’s under drawings, chart drawings and calculations, and then you can go down and there’s one that says transit chart. I think it’s like chart for now or, no, it says transits.”
What It Shows:
“And you can literally put in your natal information, and then you can put in the date that you want to know about, and it will show you exactly where everything is transiting over your natal chart.”
Question 9: Moving for Career
Student Question:
“This is intriguing! For instance, would you recommend someone move to LA for entertainment?”
Instructor Answer:
“You know what, I actually am so happy that was asked because I’m gonna use Dolores for this and I’m going to look at her relocated chart, her astrocartography. Give me one second.”
Setting Up Astrocartography:
“So I have the natal chart up right here. I’m gonna go back to chart selection because I don’t think I can go from here, and I’m gonna pull up, what’s it called? Astro click travel. That’s the name. Okay.”
Reading the Map:
“So this person is from Memphis, Tennessee. Okay. And I’m just gonna kind of scroll through and see if there’s anything interesting.”
Analysis Process:
“So right now we can see that red lines are typically malefic and blue lines are typically benefic, right? So they’re good. Saturn’s all about career; it’s really good for career. Let’s see where the Saturn is. Oh, actually the Saturn line goes straight through Memphis. That’s interesting.”
Neptune Line Discovery:
“But we also have a Neptune line that’s around LA. So this would be really good for like illusions, film, that kind of stuff. However, there is a Uranus line that goes right up the coast there too. So Uranus is really good for like groups, friends, all that fun stuff.”
The Recommendation:
“What I would do is I would say, based off of the quick analyzing, and I would always go deeper, but she could move from here, have something that is like Neptunian based for her job, so you know, like I said, film, dancing, music, whatever, and then that brings her money, so she should, from Memphis, go to Los Angeles and live out her career.”
Additional Considerations:
“Now, also we have the moon over here on the East Coast, and the moon is emotions and feelings and whatnot. And I would have to see what’s the other planet. The other planet doesn’t show me. But I would say that that’s something that she can’t ignore because the moon is the ruler of her 12th house.”
Location Strategy:
“So she could live on either coast and be fine, but she would probably be more happy and it would be more lucrative and successful if she was on the West Coast as opposed to the East Coast. But she’ll feel more comfortable in Memphis.”
The Reframe:
“But you’re not, you don’t move somewhere for comfort. You move somewhere because you want a different result. So I would say West Coast for sure.”
Question 10: When to Start Manifesting
Student Question:
“When does one start to manifest or transmute the energy? At the exact date the transit hits or as it’s approaching?”
Instructor Answer:
“As it’s approaching. And honestly, it actually depends because it goes based off of the planet.”
The Orb System:
“So if it’s Saturn, it’s got a seven to eight degree orb of influence. So seven to eight degrees before Saturn hits that planet in your natal chart, that’s when you start to feel it.”
Early Awareness:
“But if you’re looking at an ephemeris or your transits and you see that a year from now Saturn’s gonna hit your moon, I wouldn’t wait until 10 months or a year from now. I would start setting myself up and getting ready and transmuting and doing all the meditation or affirmations or really focusing and goal-setting and planning.”
The Manifestation Timeline:
“And then as you get closer, maybe about three months out from when it’s actually gonna happen, that’s when you take action and do whatever you need to do. But like I said with the debt thing, if you knew Saturn was coming into your eighth house, don’t wait until Saturn’s in your eighth house to deal with your debt.”
Proactive Strategy:
“Start when it’s in the seventh so that when it gets to your eighth house, you’re actually already ahead of it. Does that make sense?”

ELECTIONAL ASTROLOGY: PICKING DATES
The Wedding Date Example
Student Request:
“Can you show how to use transits to pick a wedding date? I have asked many astrologers about this for my wedding and they didn’t give a concrete answer.”
Instructor Response:
“Of course I can. I love picking dates; it’s actually one of my favorite things to do. So let me ask you this: what year are you getting married? Or do you have the year picked out yet?”
Student Answer: “2023”
Setting Parameters:
“Okay. So 2023, and I’m assuming you have some control over the months, not to like put you, you know, on the spot here. But do you know like are you a spring, summer, fall, winter kind of person?”
Student Answer: “October-November preferably”
The Analysis Process
Starting Point:
Direct Quote:
“Perfect, okay. Alright, so I’m gonna do a demonstration here, and I’m actually gonna use Dolores’ chart to do this because I can’t do it for you because you are a real person and this could take me like an hour and a half to actually do your chart.”
Date Range:
“But I’m going to show you what I do, and then maybe you can mimic this, or you can have somebody else who’s an astrologer do this, and you can kind of have them follow along with what I’m doing. So October to November of 2023, so I’m gonna do this.”
Step 1: Saturn Check
Direct Quote:
“Okay, so the first thing I do is I look at the transiting Saturn because Saturn is long-term goals, long-term restrictions. I always start there.”
Finding Saturn:
“Okay, so in 2023 in October, Saturn is at, I’m in October 1st right now, Saturn is at zero degrees and 42 minutes in Pisces. So it’s in Pisces. Okay. And then I’m gonna fast forward, and on November 30th, it is at one degree, so Saturn doesn’t move too much.”
The Interpretation:
“Okay, so Saturn is transiting Dolores’ eighth house. That’s pretty good, actually, for a wedding because Saturn is all about structure and you want structure in your marriage. And you want to overcome and achieve goals together.”
The Concern:
“The only thing that I would, you know, make sure of is that there’s nothing that’s gonna hit any of her planets natally that’s gonna cause any sort of conflict that has to do with shared resources.”
Why This Matters:
“Because you don’t wanna get married and then all of a sudden there’s some sort of financial thing, or somebody comes after you, or, you know, anything along those lines. Or you start your marriage off with debt that you didn’t expect or whatever, you know. So I wanna make sure there’s nothing there.”
Step 2: Checking Saturn Aspects
Direct Quote:
“So Saturn at zero to one degrees. I know that, let’s just double check. So on her natal chart, her moon is at 14, Uranus is at 19, Pluto at 15, Neptune at 18. So we’re not concerned with any of that. Nothing’s getting hit.”
Additional Check:
“What about Chiron at 10 and Jupiter at 22? Nope, we’re good. So Saturn itself is not hitting any planets natally. However, I wanna know what is Saturn doing? What is Saturn aspecting?”
October Analysis:
“So in October, Saturn is sextile Jupiter. That’s great. So Jupiter is expansion, luck, you know, doing things right, and a sextile is easy. That’s like a, it’s a minor aspect, but it’s good.”
The Assessment:
“So you can use, you can have Jupiter energy within your wedding, within your marriage, and within your marriage’s start, which is good. And then Saturn, what else is it doing? Trine Mars, okay. Well, Mars is sex and all that stuff, so that’s good.”
November Check:
“If I go to November, same thing. Saturn sextile Jupiter, trine Mars. Okay. So we’re not running into any issues there.”
Step 3: Checking Other Major Transits
Uranus:
“Let’s do Uranus. Uranus in October and November, 23 to 21 degrees in Taurus. So Uranus is in, it’s approaching retrograde, it’s retrograde, and it’s in her 10th house. That’s actually pretty interesting.”
The Interpretation:
“Uranus here could bring some changes as it’s going retrograde. It’s moving backwards, so it’s gonna bring like maybe some revisiting of themes or, you know, like if there was an ex that she had to like get closure with before she goes into this wedding or something.”
Aspect Check:
“But what I wanna know is what is Uranus doing? So, and I also wanna know what Uranus is actually hitting. So Uranus at 23 to 21. So it’s not hitting anything. Sun’s at 17, Mercury’s at one. So it’s not hitting that. Okay.”
More Planets:
“Let’s do Pluto. Pluto is, in October it’s at 27 Capricorn, and in November, oh it’s gonna move into Aquarius. Interesting. Okay. So in November, Pluto moves into Aquarius at zero degrees. So that is huge because Pluto takes 11 to 32 years to move through a sign.”
The Significance:
“So this would be like a generational shift that would be happening at her wedding. And the energy of that is like power and transformation that would be going on, and it’s happening right around the time that she’s getting married.”
Checking Pluto:
“Pluto at 27 Capricorn to zero Aquarius. What’s getting hit? Nothing’s in Capricorn. Nothing’s at 27, and she doesn’t have anything at zero Aquarius either. So we’re good there.”
Step 4: Mars and Venus
Mars Check:
“Okay, let’s do Mars. Mars moves pretty quickly. So I’m gonna have to kind of narrow it down a little bit. But in October, Mars starts at 11 degrees Libra and ends at 28 degrees Libra.”
The Problem:
“So in this month, if I’m not mistaken, because I see it at 28, Mars is gonna hit Pluto in Libra at 15 degrees in the first house. That’s not ideal.”
Why It’s Not Ideal:
“So Mars hitting Pluto is explosive. It is intensity, it is volatility, and it could bring up things. Now it’s a conjunction, so there could be something really powerful about it.”
The Transmutation:
“But I think that in terms of a wedding, which is supposed to be like more harmonious, even though people argue and things happen, I wouldn’t want that energy at a wedding. However, if you wanted like a really passionate, intense, powerful relationship that starts off with like this raw sexual energy and, you know, couple goals kind of vibe, I would use that.”
November Option:
“But I’m gonna move to November and see if that’s there. Okay, so in November, Mars is gonna be in Scorpio. That’s actually better.”
Mars in Scorpio:
“Okay, so Mars, let’s just double check that. At the end of November, Mars is at 14 degrees Scorpio. So I wanna check to see, is there anything getting hit here? Moon at 14, so yes, Mars is hitting the moon.”
Moon Conjunction:
“Now the moon is emotions. And so this could mean that the wedding itself, the day of the wedding, there could be a lot of emotions that are heightened, but it’s a conjunction, so it’s like you’re happy, you’re happy crying kind of vibe.”
Decision Point:
“But again, I’m gonna see what days specifically we can do where Mars isn’t over the moon because I just, for me, I don’t like that energy.”
Venus:
“Let’s do Venus. Venus in October starts at 11 Virgo, ends at nine Libra, and then in November, Venus is in Libra the entire time starting at nine and ending at 26.”
The Good News:
“So Venus is gonna be in the second and third house, so that’s money and communication. I actually really like that placement because Venus is good for a wedding. It’s love, it’s partnerships, but I don’t want it in the seventh because the seventh is also open enemies and conflict, legal stuff.”
The Preference:
“So I like it in the second because second house is values and, you know, you’re there, you’re committing to each other, you’re bringing that value to each other, and you’re, third house is communication and talking. So I think that that’s good.”
Step 5: The Moon (Final Activation)
The Critical Element:
Direct Quote:
“Okay. So now we have kind of like a baseline. The moon is the final step, guys. The moon is always the activator, so anytime any major event is that’s happening, anytime the moon is, you know doing something, you’ll feel agitation, or you feel focused, or you feel, you know, your attention emotionally drawn to something; it’s because of the moon placement.”
Warning:
“And as you saw, I moved it because I didn’t like the moon over the moon. That can create a depression; it can create heightened emotions. And when her moon is already aspected to too many things on a wedding, I don’t think that that’s a good thing. So I moved her moon over here.”
Picking the Specific Date
November Analysis:
Direct Quote:
“So I’m gonna go to November. I’m gonna say November 1st through 15th just to kind of give us a window here. And I’m gonna see where the moon is and where it’s going.”
Moon Movement:
“Okay, so the moon, oh, this is good. The moon on November 1st is at 13 Taurus and on November 15th, it’s at three Libra. Okay.”
The Decision Process:
“So I want the moon to be either away from her moon here, or I want the moon to be supporting Venus. Those would be the two best scenarios.”
Narrowing Down:
“So let me see. The moon natally is at 14 degrees Scorpio. So I want the moon to be nowhere near 14 degrees of anything if I can help it. Let me go day by day here.”
Checking Dates:
                              * “November 1st, the moon is at 13 Taurus. That’s good.”
                              * “November 2nd, it’s at 25 Taurus. That’s actually even better.”
                              * “November 3rd, seven Gemini. Okay.”
                              * “November 4th, 19 Gemini. That’s good.”
                              * “November 5th, one Cancer. Okay.”
The Chiron Consideration:
“So far, I’m liking one, two, three, four, and five. Let me check to make sure Chiron is where. Chiron is at 10 degrees Taurus. So on November 1st, I don’t like that the moon is conjunct Chiron. So I’m eliminating November 1st.”
Further Elimination:
“November 3rd, the moon is at seven Gemini. Gemini is Mercury, Mercury is at one degree. So the moon is not hitting Mercury natally. That’s fine.”
Aspects Matter:
“Let me see what aspects there are. Okay, so the moon is trine Pluto. That’s actually pretty good. So the moon trine Pluto is deep emotions, it’s powerful, but it’s in a harmonious way.”
More Checks:
“The moon is also sextile Mars. Okay, that’s good. So the moon’s making good aspects on November 3rd.”
Comparing Dates:
“Let me check November 2nd. Moon is at 25 Taurus. The moon is trine Mercury. Okay. And the moon is trine the sun. Okay. And the moon is sextile Neptune.”
The Concern:
“Actually, that’s, Neptune can be an illusion, right? So I don’t want illusions happening on a wedding day where you think something’s perfect and then you realize later it wasn’t. So I don’t like the sextile to Neptune.”
Between Two Dates:
“So I’m gonna say between November 2nd and November 3rd. And I would lean more towards November 3rd.”
Final Verification:
“November 3rd, 2023. Let me just double, triple check everything. So Saturn is sextile Jupiter, trine Mars. Good. Uranus is not hitting anything. Good. Pluto is in Capricorn at 27 degrees, not hitting anything. Good.”
Mars Clear:
“Mars is at zero degrees Scorpio. Is it hitting anything? No. Good. Venus is at 15 degrees Libra. Is it hitting anything? Pluto at 15. Okay, so Venus is conjunct Pluto.”
Venus-Pluto Analysis:
“That’s interesting. So Venus conjunct Pluto is very intense, it’s very passionate, it’s very like deep love. But it’s also, it can be obsessive. So if you want that energy, that’s great.”
Alternative Option:
“But let me see if we can find a day where Venus is not over Pluto. So Venus on November 4th is at 16 degrees. So it’s already passed. So if I wanted to avoid that, I would do November 4th, 5th, or 6th.”
The Winning Date
Final Analysis:
Direct Quote:
“Let me check November 4th. Okay, so the moon is at 19 Gemini. Moon is trine Saturn. That’s good. Moon is sextile Venus. That’s good. Moon is square Neptune.”
The Verdict:
“Ugh, I don’t like that. Okay, so between November 3rd and November 4th, I would pick November 3rd because I think the Venus-Pluto conjunction is powerful and passionate, whereas the moon square Neptune is confusing and illusions.”
Final Recommendation:
Direct Quote:
“So my recommendation for Dolores if she’s getting married in 2023 would be November 3rd, 2023.”
Time of Day:
“And then I would pick the time based off of, you know, whatever other transits are happening, what ascendant you want, what kind of energy you want for the day.”
The Teaching Point:
“But that’s basically how I do it. And I know that took me, you know, 20 minutes or so, but when I do it for clients, it takes me about an hour and a half to two hours because I’m going through every single thing and I’m checking all the aspects and I’m making sure everything is perfect.”

ASTROCARTOGRAPHY DEEP DIVE
The Memphis Question
Follow-Up Student Question:
“Why would she feel more comfortable in Memphis?”
Instructor Answer:
“Well, because that’s where she’s from. That’s where her roots are. That’s where she was born and raised, you know.”
The Chart Interpretation:
“And looking at the chart, she has a very big emphasis on family and home and traditions and things like that. And so Memphis is comfortable because that’s what she knows. She knows the culture, she knows the people, she knows her family’s there, her friends are probably there.”
The Growth Challenge:
“But if she wants to grow and if she wants to achieve the things that she wants in entertainment or whatever, she needs to be where the energy supports that. And that’s not in Memphis; that’s on the West Coast.”
The Comfort Trap:
“So staying in Memphis would be comfortable, but it would also be limiting. And she may end up resenting it later if she doesn’t take the chance to move and pursue her dreams.”
Saturn Line Significance
Additional Explanation:
“Now, the Saturn line going through Memphis is interesting because Saturn is career and structure. So she may have a very structured career path in Memphis, but it may not be in the field that she wants.”
The Neptune Difference:
“Whereas the Neptune line in LA is specifically about film, illusions, creativity, all the things that align with entertainment. So if entertainment is the goal, LA is the place to be.”
________________


PROGRESSIONS & TIMING
Progressed Sun Movement
Student Note:
“Angie says, wow, my son is now in Taurus; I would not have known that it moves.”
Instructor Response:
“Ah, see, learning something has nothing to do with the actual class. No, progressions are extremely important.”
What Changes:
“Understanding the new midheaven, for instance, if the midheaven shifted, understanding where your moon is. In progressions, your moon moves every two to two and a half years, moves into a new sign as well, so you’re constantly in a varying emotional state.”
Layering Transits:
“On top of the fact that the moon itself in transit, orbiting the earth, moves quite quickly as well and is two to two and a half days in every sign, so moon, the moon, I’m gonna be teaching a moon class.”
The Challenge:
“That moon is sometimes a little bee-ha, but if you understand what her purpose is, then you can utilize it. So the agitation can always be transmuted.”
________________


RETROGRADE TRANSMUTATION
The Reflection Purpose
Core Teaching:
Direct Quote:
“And before I even get in here, let me talk real quick about the purpose of transmuting. We’ve already done classes one through four, so I’m not going back to teach you any of the basics, any of the energy, what the aspects are. I’ll highlight them as I teach and go, and I’m not even gonna talk about how I pull all this together. You’re just gonna watch as we do it.”
Retrograde Energy:
“But the purpose of transmuting is to understand. Now, we talked about retrogrades in another class, which I will put out soon, which is utilizing retrogrades for positive action. And understanding that the observable backwards motion, which is not real, it is only in perspective of where we are on the planet, creates an influx; or, not influx, a flux in the way the energy hits us.”
Inward Motion:
“And it works inwardly. You can call it backwards because that’s what the planet’s visually doing, but it’s really a flux; it’s an inward thing. So, as that planet, the transits, hit us, it’s causing that energy to go inward and for us to basically do reflection.”
Practical Retrograde Use
The Car Example Revisited:
When Mercury goes retrograde over 3rd house:
                              1. Recognize the transit and what it means
                              2. Identify the specific area of life affected (car purchase, contracts)
                              3. Determine what aspects indicate the specific problem area
                              4. Act proactively to renegotiate or revise before signing
                              5. Use the knowledge to get ahead of the default outcome
The Power Shift:
“That is what transmutation is: to transmute the energies, meaning to take what was going to happen and make it be something I want to happen within the confines of those energies.”
________________


FINAL SYNTHESIS: PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER
The Three Pillars Integrated
MINDSET:
                              * Clear belief system that energy is malleable
                              * Elimination of all toxic situations/people/cycles
                              * Understanding of five key planets (Chiron, Moon, Neptune, Pluto, Sun)
                              * Recognition of life as a strategic game
                              * Acceptance of failure as learning opportunity
TRANSMUTATION:
                              * Using planetary energies actively (Mars = action, Saturn = structure, etc.)
                              * One-way energy law: conscious direction prevents default manifestation
                              * Selective transmutation (only change what needs changing)
                              * Mental framing and narrative creation
                              * Aspect and rulership web analysis
                              * Applying higher vibration consciously
DIVINE TIMING:
                              * Saturn transits for long-term goal alignment
                              * Moon transits for event activation
                              * Progressed chart for current life phase
                              * Retrograde periods for reflection and revision
                              * Electional astrology for optimal date selection
                              * Astrocartography for location-based manifestation
The Formula
Step 1: KNOW
                              * Know your natal chart inside and out
                              * Know your progressions and current life phase
                              * Know upcoming transits (especially Saturn)
                              * Know your five key planets intimately
Step 2: DECIDE
                              * Decide what you want to manifest
                              * Decide it must be attainable within your energies
                              * Decide it must align with your Sun (happiness)
                              * Decide you will eliminate obstacles
Step 3: ANALYZE
                              * Analyze how energy currently manifests (lowest vibration)
                              * Analyze what aspects/rulers are involved
                              * Analyze what would constitute higher vibration
                              * Analyze upcoming transits for timing
Step 4: FRAME
                              * Frame the mental narrative
                              * Frame the aspects positively
                              * Frame the action steps clearly
                              * Frame your identity around the manifestation
Step 5: ACT
                              * Act when transits support
                              * Act before restrictive transits arrive
                              * Act with the planetary energy (not against)
                              * Act consistently until manifestation
Step 6: ADJUST
                              * Adjust when retrogrades offer reflection
                              * Adjust when progressions shift your life phase
                              * Adjust when feedback shows misalignment
                              * Adjust without abandoning core goal
The Non-Negotiables
From the Class:
                              1. Toxic Elimination:
“None of this matters if you vibe with toxic people or toxic situations; I cannot help you if that’s the type of life you continue to lead.”
                              2. Energy Exclusivity:
“Energies cannot manifest two different ways at the same time, which means if you are using the energy, it can’t do something else because you are telling the energy at what vibration to resonate.”
                              3. Proactive vs. Reactive:
“And instead of it feeling like you’re reacting to circumstance, you’re actually going and creating the circumstance. That’s transmutation, that’s manifestation, that’s divine timing, all three together.”
                              4. Personal Responsibility:
“Pluto is your power. If you do not harness Pluto, it’s everyone else’s power, and it becomes your chaos.”
                              5. Happiness Integration:
“You could be wealthy, but you won’t be happy. And we need the full package. Manifestation, nobody manifests to be rich and depressed; we don’t do that.”

KEY QUOTES FOR APP IMPLEMENTATION
Mindset Section:
“What you believe is what you achieve.”
“None of this matters if you vibe with toxic people or toxic situations.”
“Vibe higher.”
“Life is a popularity contest… you gotta figure out your way in there because that is also part of manifestation, is understanding the game.”
Transmutation Section:
“Energies cannot manifest two different ways at the same time.”
“That is what transmutation is: to transmute the energies, meaning to take what was going to happen and make it be something I want to happen within the confines of those energies.”
“Retrogrades are not bad; retrogrades are really good, actually, because they help re-steer you and change course when you could be hitting an iceberg.”
Divine Timing Section:
“Saturn is the most important, in my opinion, planet outside of the moon, but the moon is on a daily level.”
“The moon is always the activator.”
“Don’t wait until Saturn’s in your eighth house to deal with your debt. Start when it’s in the seventh so that when it gets to your eighth house, you’re actually already ahead of it.”
Integration Quote:
“And instead of it feeling like you’re reacting to circumstance, you’re actually going and creating the circumstance. That’s transmutation, that’s manifestation, that’s divine timing, all three together.

Complete Knowledge Extraction - Harvard-Level Documentation
________________


CLASS OVERVIEW & SYSTEM FOUNDATION
The TRUE Astrology System
Direct Quote:
“Welcome to the Mystic Rebels Rebel Academy True Astrology Start Making Money class. This is true astrology. So whatever’s going on in your chart, that’s what we’re using to be able to manifest the type of life that you want to live. True stands for transmuting real universal energies. This is a system I developed.”
Critical Prerequisite Warning:
Direct Quote:
“So if you’re jumping into the Start Making Money class and you have not taken the Master Class, then you need to stop and go back and take that. Because if you continue on with this one, you haven’t done that, you’re going to be lost. I’m going to be talking about all the principles that I teach you in those five classes. And I will refer to them constantly. I will use them as though you already know what I’m talking about. So I’m not going to break it down. Make sure you’ve taken that before you come here.”
This class assumes complete mastery of Classes 1-5 (chart mechanics, interpretation, aspects, transits, manifestation).
________________


COSMIC TIMING: WHY NOW?
Jupiter-North Node Conjunction in Taurus
The Astrological Significance:
Direct Quote:
“Now, the reason I’m teaching this class is because while I’m teaching it, Jupiter and the North Node are conjunct. They are in Taurus right now. Uranus is in Taurus. This is all about changing your mindset on value, changing how you look at things when it comes to money and finances. It’s also about learning. It’s also about teaching. Like this is what I’m supposed to be doing right now.”
Personal Alignment:
“And this is over my midheaven in Taurus in the 10th house. So I feel like this class is extremely important.”
The Universal Need:
Direct Quote:
“Also, just because Whether I’m doing tarot or astrology, it is the most common question that I get. How do I make my finances better? How do I build wealth? Am I doomed? Like I usually get the adverse side of this. Am I doomed? Am I not going to make money? Why do I always lose money?”
________________


FOUNDATIONAL PRINCIPLES
The Transmutation Philosophy
Core Teaching:
Direct Quote:
“The second house and Venus placement have to do with not money. How much money you’re going to make, but your relationship with money. And a lot of people get this wrong. They think that the placement there is what it is. First off, we know that the blueprint is there, but it is not a static set of energies. You can transmute energies. Otherwise, the true astrology system wouldn’t work. We use it in our everyday life here at Mystic Rebels.”
The Promise:
“So we know that you can take this energy, align with it, and do amazing things with your life, which are going to bring you value and also increase your own sense of self-worth. And then, of course, your finances and money.”
Multiple Money Indicators
Direct Quote:
“And there are a lot of things in the chart that signify money. Although I consider this an intro class because we’re only going to be talking mainly about… the Venus placement, and the second house.”
Future Classes Promised:
“There’s going to be a lot of information in this class, and I will be building upon this because money, again, is one of the things that I get asked, whether tarot or astrology, it’s always about improving finances or going off on your own or making sure that you are set because in this material world, this is one of the things, it’s one area of life that we need to be able to manifest the types of things that we want here.”
________________


CRITICAL CHART INTEGRATION PRINCIPLE
The Whole Chart Matters
Direct Quote:
“This is Probably the most important thing to realize is that although I’m going to be focusing on Venus, Taurus, and the second house placements, that everything in your chart works together. And you are not like anybody else. You have energies that are very specific to you.”
Warning About Generic Astrology:
Direct Quote:
“So when you hear people doing horoscopes or doing these social media videos realize. That’s not you specifically. Although there may be an overtone that could apply to you if you make it work. They do not have your chart in front of you. They don’t know all your aspects, your rulerships. They don’t know the trains that’s going to whatever planets that you have. They don’t know the quincunx or the square or the trine. They know nothing like that in your chart.”
Personal Responsibility:
“This is for you to develop the… the knowledge and the insight to be able to say okay these are the transits happening this is what’s in my natal chart…”
________________


SCOPE LIMITATIONS - WHAT THIS CLASS DOES NOT COVER
1. Progressions
Direct Quote:
“A couple of things that I’m not going to be talking about in this class, but are going to be very important for other classes, include your progressions and your relocations.”
Why Progressions Matter:
“In your progressions as we go through life, what you do when you’re 20 to make money is not going to be the same as 30, 40, 50, 60, 70. It’s always going to change. It’s always going to be different. Progressing. You are evolving. Different transits are happening. Different events in your life are going to unfold.”
The Warning:
“You need to make sure that you’re not staying static. It’s very good to understand your natal chart, but realize that as you progress and get older, a lot of these things are going to add nuances and layers onto what you’re doing.”
Course Correction:
“So you may start something, you might be successful for three years. You might hit a wall. That wall can be overcome if you understand the energies at play. But if you keep trying to do the same thing you’ve always been doing, you may be trying to work against a transit or some sort of aspect in your progressions. And that is the warning to say, hey, you got to make some changes in course correct.”
2. Relocations / Astrocartography
Direct Quote:
“If you have moved, you have to factor in the new area and how, if you were born there, that’s the area. The energy’s influence of that area impacting you. And it does make changes to a lot of things, namely how you make money usually is greatly impacted because your midheaven is usually altered in some way.”
3. Transits
Direct Quote:
“Again, this is your relationship with money, and your entire chart is a factor. We have your ascendant here, which is how you approach life in general… I’m only going to be talking about the natal chart in this class, I’ll be talking about transits in a separate class because it’s just a lot of information and I wanna make sure that you get this down.”
4. Business Finance (8th House)
Direct Quote:
“Another thing that I don’t talk about much in this is because this is more on your personal level is business finance is the eighth house and Scorpio and Pluto. So those are a different class for when I do the business class. This is more for your money. Although, if you have your own business, this still applies in addition to what the business revenue would be.”
________________


HOUSE SYSTEM FRAMEWORK
The Money-Related Houses Defined
ASCENDANT:
Direct Quote:
“We have your ascendant here, which is how you approach life in general, which means whether we’re talking about love, career, children, your friends, spirituality, it all comes back to the ascendant because that point right there is the hot wire of who you are in the first house of self. So that is always going to be a factor.”
Application:
“So the ascendant has everything to do with your actions in this world. And that includes how you make money and why.”
SECOND HOUSE:
Direct Quote:
“Your second house, we’ve already talked about that. It is the relationship with money and how you align with value. It is your values and how you believe in your values. So it is not just money for like the static generalized term but more how you and your relationships, you and money have this bond or lack thereof.”
Additional Themes:
“This also rules the earth, mother nature, childbirth, womanhood. It’s all the second house. But again, we are focusing through the lens of money and finances…”
SIXTH HOUSE:
Direct Quote:
“The sixth house has to do with your work environment and your daily routine.”
Distinction from 10th:
“The sixth house and the 10th house do differ. The sixth house is where you have the authority. It’s where… you’re seeing in the workplace and how those themes apply. Whereas the sixth house has to do with the service, the type of job that you do in terms of services and the daily routine and the work environment. When you go there, what’s around you? What type of environment are you in?”
TENTH HOUSE:
Direct Quote:
“The 10th house is your reputation and public image. We talk about this being your career house because it themes the type of work that we do.”
Why It’s Career:
“Your 10th house does rule everything that Capricorn would rule.”
MIDHEAVEN (MC):
Critical Distinction:
Direct Quote:
“The midheaven, often aligned with the 10th house, right? They’re used synonymously, but they’re not actually synonymous.”
The Floating Point:
“Your 10th house does rule everything that Capricorn would rule. But the midheaven is a point that can actually float anywhere from the 8th to the 11th house. Oftentimes, it’s in the 9th or 11th. Eighth is actually very rare, but I’ve seen it.”
What It Represents:
“And then often I obviously see it in the 10th house, but this is really the opposition of your IC, the opposition of your nadir. The energy that you keep private, it’s everything that you don’t keep private and you want to put out in the world. It’s the trajectory, the opposition of what you seek and how you want to be seen.”
Life Purpose:
“And this ends up being… We call it your life purpose again because it opposes our private world, but it is a very personal angle point. It is public, yet it’s very personal to us just because it opposes the extremely personal IC.”
EIGHTH HOUSE (Business - Not Covered):
Direct Quote:
“Another thing that I don’t talk about much in this is because this is more on your personal level is business finance is the eighth house and Scorpio and Pluto. So those are a different class for when I do the business class.”
VENUS & SECOND HOUSE RULER:
Direct Quote:
“And then, of course, Venus and your second house ruler. Remember, rulerships are extremely important. Bidirectionality of rulerships, if you have any planets in the second house, also very important. And then, of course, aspects. This will all add additional information to color and theme, everything to do with money.”
Complexity Acknowledged:
“So it is a very complex topic. But once you get into it, you’ll start seeing the themes and how they play out in your life and then you can start aligning with them.”
________________


VENUS & LIBRA: THE UNIVERSAL MONEY FACTORS
The Overlooked Connection
Direct Quote (from Aries Rising section):
“Now, the money ruler is Venus. That’s natural, right? Because Taurus rules money. So… for an Aries rising, they’re looking to Taurus anyway. I also want to point out that anytime that you’re looking at Venus and Taurus for money, you’re always looking at Libra. This is something that’s often overlooked people don’t do not look at their Libra house to understand that it’s also a factor for making money now.”
Why Libra Matters:
“I’m not going to talk about Libra much throughout the entire thing. I’m making the statement now. Aries rising also have to consider how their seventh house is situated because they will also make money through others. They do it themselves, but they need somebody else to buy. So this is how they interact and this is how it works for their Libra placement to be involved. Aries rising needs that Libra to be involved.”
Partnership Energy:
“So there’s often some aspect of either partnership, one-on-one dealings, dealing directly with the public and public as a whole, not public as in like one-on-one as a group rather. It’s the public as one. So this is extremely important. Remember, Libra is very important when you’re talking about money as well.”
Universal Application:
Direct Quote (from Taurus Rising section):
“To be fair, every single… every single planet, every single, oh my God, I can’t think. Every single sign has Venus to look to because Venus also rules this.”
________________


COMPLETE 12 RISING SIGN ANALYSIS
Methodology Note
Direct Quote:
“Now we go on. I’m just going to go through each of your rising signs from Aries all the way to Pisces. And we’re going to just talk a little bit about your relationship and the ways to kind of use that energy and generate.”
Assumptions:
“I’m going to assume that there are no planets in any of these houses. I’m not going to talk about the rulership right now other than what it is. I’m not going to talk about where it is.”
Generalization Warning:
“This is Probably the most important thing… I’m going to go through all this, and it is not going to be 100% applicable to every single person because this is very generic, however, it’s a foundation to work off of. And each placement, rulership, and aspect is going to change this per person. But this is the basis. Assuming no planets, not talking about the rulership.”
________________


ARIES RISING
Second House: Taurus
Money Ruler: Venus
Relationship with Money
Direct Quote:
“The relationship for most Aries risings is that they enjoy comfortable things. They enjoy having things that are valuable. Value is extremely important. If they buy something, if they spend money on something, they want the value out of it. And it needs to be equal to the amount that they’re putting out.”
Spending Patterns:
“They don’t mind spending money, and they will spend on luxury, but it’s usually because they’re in Aries rising, something that they want, right? The rising sign always colors the second house.”
Money Compartmentalization:
“But money is money. This is kind of a compartmentalized thing for Aries rising in general. Work is work. Communication is communication. Home is home. Blah, blah, blah. But money is money. They make money to make money. They see the value in money.”
The Separation:
“But until you get into the rulership, the actual topic of money doesn’t really span around into the rest of their chart. They understand it for what it is. And that’s just a generalized natural Aries rising thing.”
Ways to Generate Money
Direct Quote:
“Now, in order for them to generate money, they can do anything that involves food, they can you sell tangible, physical items, they can do anything that’s art-related, and they can do anything that’s directly related to finance.”
Specific Careers:
“They could be bankers, they could be investors, they could be in investments, investment banking, obviously, if you tie it all together. Anything that they handle money, depending on how other things are situated in the chart, they could even be into cryptocurrency.”
Value-Based Work:
“But it’s all about the value of something. This could even be somebody who’s into like auctions and things like that if they have certain placements that say, ‘I want that value to be, I want to get more value than I put out,’ right? So if there’s another Virgo placement or Mercury placement that’s involved with Taurus, it could be somebody who does something like that. But value is value for them.”
The Libra Connection
Critical Addition:
“I also want to point out that anytime that you’re looking at Venus and Taurus for money, you’re always looking at Libra… Aries rising also have to consider how their seventh house is situated because they will also make money through others.”
How It Works:
“They do it themselves, but they need somebody else to buy. So this is how they interact and this is how it works for their Libra placement to be involved. Aries rising needs that Libra to be involved.”
Public Dealing:
“So there’s often some aspect of either partnership, one-on-one dealings, dealing directly with the public and public as a whole…”
________________


TAURUS RISING
Second House: Gemini
Money Ruler: Mercury
Relationship with Money
The Knowledge Paradox:
Direct Quote:
“Well, Taurus Rising is automatically about value anyway. Their second house is Gemini, but they themselves, they enjoy to be comfortable. They enjoy luxury. They enjoy the finer things. They enjoy… like I think I already said it, luxury, finer things, things that are handmade. These are very important to them. Things that have value, things that have even a little bit of sentimentism.”
But:
“The money ruler is Mercury, though. So while you will look at Venus for every single rising sign, you will always look at the second house ruler in this case, Gemini’s ruler is Mercury. So you’re going to look at Mercury’s placement. So now you’re looking at Libra. You’re looking at Mercury. And because Mercury is also co-ruled, you will also be looking at Virgo.”
The Core Issue:
Direct Quote:
“So the relationship with money because they have a Gemini in the second house for Taurus rising is that they always think they know how much money they have. but they don’t typically know. It’s always like this average.”
The Mental Process:
“They think, logically speaking, based off of everything that’s happened, I think I know how much money I have, but they almost never know the exact amount.”
Exception:
“If they do know the exact amount, it’s because Mercury is in a very specific position and then they are more factual. Like if they have the… uh if they have mercury in the third house for instance or in the 10th house or something like that they may always have like knowledge of their quick access to their online bank statements so they have that total at hand…”
Spending Patterns:
Direct Quote:
“They’re extremely impulsive for new things. Shiny objects. Ooh, that looks nice. I want to buy something. I see that on TV, infomercials, all that kind of stuff. They’re the first ones to jump on that.”
The Duality:
“They tend to have two of everything. It’s like, I get this. I see it. But, you know, it came in blue and it came in purple. And I really liked both. It was like a like a teal and this and they justify it. They rationalize it, which is the other part of this. It’s logical, even if they have to rationalize it. So it’s not always logical to other people. It’s logical to them.”
Physical Connection:
“And this is kind of things. And they like trinkets, you know, little knickknacks and stuff like that that they could play with their hands as well. And that fit in their hands.”
The Cerebral Nature:
Direct Quote:
“Now, this is the relationship with them with this. And when I’m talking about the relationship here, guys, sometimes it’s how they accumulate money. Sometimes it’s the reason why they feel like they don’t have money. But either way, it’s just how they interact, how they think, how they feel. It’s not always about thinking that’s more Gemini, but how they associate with value and money. It’s very cerebral. It’s very hands-on. It’s very like ‘do-do-do-do-do-do-do’ for Taurus rising when there’s Gemini there.”
Ways to Generate Money
Direct Quote:
“The ways to generate money are through communication, some sort of communication, which could be writing, could be… could be online, could be social media. Obviously, the rulership is all going to be a part of this in Virgo’s placement.”
Hand Work:
“Working with their hands, like writing and coding and things of that nature where hand-eye coordination is one way to do that.”
Data & Numbers:
“Logistics, anything that deals with data, numbers. You see a lot of accountants who are Taurus rising because, remember, finance is very important already. And then the actual data is how they make their money through it.”
Multiple Streams:
Direct Quote:
“And then multiple streams of income. This is very common for Taurus rising. Anybody who has Mercury or Gemini, either in the 10th or the 6th, the second house or a midheaven there in gemini multiple streams of income always or if they don’t have more than one stream of income they have a job that requires them to wear multiple hats do at least two things…”
The Gemini Need:
Critical Point:
Direct Quote:
“…and to be honest if a gemini does not have somebody with gemini prominent tendencies, does not have more than one thing to do. They tend to fizzle out, kind of hit their own roadblocks. Everybody else in the world will tell them, you know, you need to pick one thing, you need to focus on it. And that’s actually their problem is that they only have one thing and they’re focusing on the one thing and they’re losing their minds either out of boredom or it’s just not aligning with their energies.”


The Solution:
“The second side of Gemini is like, hey, what do I do? So remember, Gemini energy is all about duality.”

GEMINI RISING
Second House: Cancer
Money Ruler: Moon
Relationship with Money
The Emotional Core:
Direct Quote:
“Gemini rising, the second house is Cancer. Cancer is obviously ruled by the moon. Here, and… wherever the moon placement is and Venus placement. The relationship with money for Gemini Rising, having a Cancer second house, is that they choose to use their money or not have their money based off of their mood and their emotion.”
The Intuitive Connection:
“I felt like buying this. I had a connection to this. I don’t know why, but I really just want to get this. They also have their mood and their emotions fluctuate to the amount of money they feel they should have. Because we’re talking about cancer energy in the moon. It’s more about intuition and feeling.”
The Positive Potential:
“Now, they obviously can use their intuition as well to make good money decisions. If they have that blocked or closed off, they can have issues there.”
Privacy Issues:
Direct Quote:
“They don’t like to tell people how much something costs. They don’t like to tell how much it was, especially anything that’s in their home. It’s very private to them. Their money is very private to them. This is my money. You don’t need to know, and that’s just how it is.”
Family Connection:
“Money is definitely tied in with home and family. Often that’s where the money goes. Either they’re helping family with something, they are tying that money back into their own home, they’re investing in homes or doing something like that that is tied in with home and family.”
The Emotional Need:
Direct Quote:
“And money is more of a need. There’s an emotional security that is tied with the need for money. And although cancer tends to be related to jobs that can produce a lot of money, it’s more about the emotional security. It’s not the cancer itself is a money sign it’s that it’s the first one that has again that emotional connection to it…”
Moon Placement Effect:
“…and depending on how your emotions are placed meaning your moon placement in your chart will determine how important money is as a gemini rising”
Personal Example: The Instructor’s Mother
Direct Quote:
“A good for instance, my mother is a Gemini rising. She has cancer in the second house. Her moon is in Capricorn. So working that corporate job, making more money, having stability, that’s all tied in.”
The Structure Need:
“If she doesn’t have that 401k and those investments and that portfolio and everything and have all that structure, it will affect her mood. It does, did… you know, affect her emotional status, all based off of how much she did or didn’t have based off of what she felt she should have.”
The Volatility:
“If the money went up and down, as a Gemini, she’s seen the numbers, she gets it, but if she felt like it should have been more, the mood will be affected by it. And conversely, if it ends up being more than she thought, the mood is affected positively by that.”
Ways to Generate Money
The Public Connection:
Direct Quote:
“Ways to generate. I see this all the time. Cancer placements have… unique opportunities to really connect with the public and their personal. Cancer is like a bridge between the because of it’s so intuitive between what is very private and what is very public.”
Why Cancer Works:
“It is obviously in direct opposition to Capricorn. but it just tends to be the pulse of everything. So these cancer placements in your chart are a really good indication of where you connect well with the public because it is your intuition.”
Real Estate:
“But these people can make money doing real estate or domestic efforts.”
Domestic Work Defined:
“Domestic efforts mean anything from like knitting, to sewing, to cooking, to agriculture, farming. These are all part of this. But real estate, which can be any facet of real estate, anything that has to do with physical homes, would be a good place to make money.”
Ruler Matters:
“And obviously, you would take the ruler and see where that is. All aspects. Some people who have this are not going to be into real estate. Obviously, this applies to everything I’m talking about because rulerships, aspects, progressions all those matter in relocations as well.”
Nurturing Professions:
Direct Quote:
“Nurturing, caring professions, anything like nursing, even things like dental hygienist or babysitting, anything like that is very indicative of a… of a moon in the second house, anything where they can…”
The Gemini Layer:
“…they tend to gravitate towards the Gemini. So there’s some sort of logical component to this. Often if they are in some sort of nurturing profession, there’s some sort of logistics to it where they’re dealing with numbers or scheduling or anything like that.”
Following Intuition:
“Doing what feels good or at peace. This goes back to not only the intuition side, but the fact that cancer naturally rules the fourth house. This is all about home, family, and things that are private.”
Family Business:
“And then, of course, through family. Family businesses, working with family, creating something as a legacy for family, trying to set something up so that they can pass it down. This is all cancer type of energy.”

CANCER RISING
Second House: Leo
Money Ruler: Sun
The Sun Sign Connection
Direct Quote:
“That means the second house is Leo. So the ruler is the sun. So anyone who’s a cancer rising, you look to your sun placement to help you understand money. Now, this is like probably the closest sign, I think, to take you into. Take you into understanding kind of a pop culture-y feel about sun signs, right?”
Why It’s Different:
“Because all the other ones really have not much to do with it. The sun is vitality, happiness, you know, feeling like a kid, childhood risk and everything like that.”
Risk Factor:
“Now, risk obviously can factor in if it is implemented. Cancer risings tend to make a lot of money because of risk. Leo rules risk. And I don’t have that on here, but I wanted to mention it. That risk is associated with cancer rising due to Leo, and then the sun placement adds flavor to it.”
Relationship with Money
The Leo Preferences:
Direct Quote:
“But their relationship with money is they like things that are fancy and flashy. They like to have what’s there and makes a statement. They like to spend money on entertainment. They might go out to see the game. They might, you know, go, you know, ice skating or something along those lines. It’s anything that’s fun, enjoyable, recreation. They’ll definitely put a lot into that.”
Gambling Tendency:
“They may, or they can make it that way as well. They may enjoy gambling. So cancer risings, you do have to be careful that you don’t sit there too long because risk is a thrill. And if you’ve made a lot of money doing it, it can be addictive, obviously.”
The Abundance Mindset:
Direct Quote:
“And there’s an attitude of money is going to be there when I need it. It’s always like this because they’re cancer risings, they’re so intuitive. They feel like money is just gonna show up. And they know where to find it when they need it. And because it’s the sun, it’s like, boom, there it is.”
The Power Combination:
Direct Quote:
“They have the moon and then the sun ruling their first and second houses. So it’s very intuitive and enlightening to them. So this is why Cancers tend to be able to make a lot of money. Everybody has the ability to, but you’ll notice that a lot of people with cancer rising have been able to accumulate quite a bit of wealth because they identify with their sun sign. They let that kind of lead with their intuition.”
The Formula:
“It’s like this: the vitality and the life meets the intuition and the things that they feel. The people who know how to integrate those and have positive aspects or even negative aspects that they’ve learned to embrace tend to be able to accumulate a lot of wealth using this.”
Ways to Generate Money
Entertainment First:
Direct Quote:
“Ways to generate, obviously through entertainment and recreation. This is why you see a lot of cancer risings in entertainment, especially stage performance or theater or film.”
Creative Pursuits:
“Creative pursuits anything really that that allows for creativity and this is not just because we’re talking about the fifth house and we’re not talking about Taurus, we’re not talking about Pisces, we’re not talking about Libra we’re talking more about any way that they can express themselves in a way that is not logical, that is more creative. It’s the other side of the brain here.”
The Happiness Requirement:
Direct Quote:
“If they can do that and do that their way and have fun with it and enjoy it, you will see that they will make a lot of money doing that as well. Creative pursuits are perfect for cancer risings. Doing what makes them happiest. It’s because the sun rules the second house. It’s all about creativity, feeling like that kid and feeling like you have that life, that spark of life.”
The Critical Point:
“So the happier you are, the more money you will make. This is kind of common through most of them, but for Cancer Risings, it really has to align.”
Leadership:
“And then anything that has to do with a leadership role and doing something that they, again, they want to do, but they need to be able to have some sort of control over that and do things their way. They’re not the type that enjoys having for the most part, and enjoys having a boss.”

LEO RISING
Second House: Virgo
Money Ruler: Mercury
The Spotlight Connection
Direct Quote:
“So Leo, second house is Virgo. So we know the money ruler is Mercury here. The relation, and then of course, because it’s Mercury, you have to look at that up there in the 11th house of Gemini. So you’re gonna see a lot of Leo risings make a lot of money by being in the spotlight. They are known, they’re online, they’re influencers.”
The House Alignment:
“They are obviously, we’ve talked about the arts and anything like that. And that’s less about… Well, Leo is the creative expression. It’s that, but it’s also the fact that their money house aligns with their 11th house society house. This is another reason why you see a lot of Leo risings all over the place in all kinds of artistic endeavors because it aligns with their 11th house and their second house. So you’ll see these guys.”
The Generosity Explanation
Why Leos Are Generous:
Direct Quote:
“We talked about the generosity a little bit before when I got ahead of myself in the Aries rising. And it’s because Virgo is all about giving service to others, helping others. Again, their 11th house is tied in. That’s humanitarianism.”
The Connection:
“So when you pull in the ruler, Mercury, into what a Leo rising chart is, this is why Leos are so generous. It’s because of where the houses actually sit, not because Leo itself is inherently generous. It’s not. But Leo rising is.”
Relationship with Money
The Critical Nature:
Direct Quote:
“You see sale shoppers because Virgo is all about analyzing, being meticulous. In the house of value, they’re constantly being critical. So they’re always trying to figure out how much money they have, how much they can spend.”
Personal Exception:
“And obviously, there are plenty of Leo risings like myself who don’t keep any track of this kind of stuff. And that is because I have all that rulership in the sun, you know, my chart ruler, which is also important up here in Gemini. And it is opposite. The ruler here is opposite. Neptune and my Mercury, which rules my second house, Virgo. Yeah, Money House is opposite Uranus. So it’s like, yeah, I don’t really care that much how much money I have. I always know I can make it, but that’s because of other things in my placement.”
The Default:
“If you strip away all my chart signs as a Leo rising, which I am, then it is about this. And they’re kind of like Taurus risings in that they feel like they always know how much money they have. Again, it’s because Mercury is the ruler. So they have a good beat on how much they have.”
Personal Strategy:
Direct Quote:
“I actually use this. It’s also about strategy and detail and planning, right? I don’t necessarily plan my money, but I do do something that’s interesting. I said do. I actually use this Virgo here by I take, if I have an expense, if I’m paying out, I always round it up. So in my mind, in my bank account, I’ve paid more. If I have money coming in, I always round it down. So I always feel like I’m receiving less money. And it always keeps me having more money than I think I have, which obviously keeps me happy. But that’s something that’s actually this Virgo placement that I use there.”
The Work Requirement:
Direct Quote:
“And Virgo, I’m sorry, Leo rising because Virgo’s in the second house always feels like they have to work for their money. Now with Mercury being ruled there, it also means that stress, and this goes for Taurus rising as well, I guess, stress around finances is heavy. And maybe even more so for Taurus rising, if I’m completely honest, but Leo rising as well. Stresses around money.”
The Biggest Stressor:
“This is the biggest stressor for Taurus and Leo rising is money, finances, because they always feel like they need to work. You know, hard for them and they need to do what they do. Leo feels like they need to work hard. Taurus feels like they need to just know how to make money. And when they don’t just know how to make money, it really bothers them and stresses them out. Whereas Leo rising, it’s like, ‘I got to work hard. I know I got to work hard.’”
Exception Note:
“Obviously, if you’re Leo rising and you don’t like to work hard, you have to look at the rest of the planets. But this is, again, the basis.”
Ways to Generate Money
Services & Routine:
Direct Quote:
“To generate money for Leo rising services. It’s literally what it is work services. Those are the main things: finding routine, finding things that work on their own.”
Automation:
“Now, this is automation as well for Leo risings because Mercury ruled Gemini is in the 11th house. So it brings in technology, it brings in networks, groups, teams. brings in automation.”
The Two Paths:
Direct Quote:
“So there are actually two different ways for both Taurus and Taurus and Leo rising. Sorry, I’m staring right at it. Leo risings to make money here. And that is through the second end, the 11th house. So this is more like groups, multiple groups and multiple teams and all of that. And the actual workings of automation. And Virgo is all about the services. It’s all about creating a strategy.”
Healthcare Management:
Direct Quote:
“And also, of course, health services and medical management, because Leo’s the ruler. If you have Virgo here, if you are in medicine or any type of healthcare or any type of service related industry, you may start there, but your goal is to work your way up to the top because your value is with Taurus in the 10th house, your value is in the management. Again, without any planets or anything like that.”
________________


VIRGO RISING
Second House: Libra
Money Ruler: Venus
The Venus Connection
Direct Quote:
“Virgo rising, just like Aries rising, has a Venus ruled second house. So Aries and Virgo are both going to have Venus to look to. To be fair, every single… every single planet, every single, oh my God, I can’t think. Every single sign has Venus to look to because Venus also rules this.”
The Ninth House:
“But in terms of the houses, you’re going to look at Taurus here. So a Virgo rising is going to look to their ninth house. So things that they’re educated on, higher education, college, culture, travel, things of that nature that they put value in and how they make money and international money.”
International Potential:
“Virgo rising can make money through international endeavors pretty easily if they are set up for it. And obviously you look to see where Venus is and if it’s positively aspected, that would be how it is.”
Relationship with Money
The Partner Dynamic:
Direct Quote:
“Libra rising. Now, this is the key: because Libra is in the second house of Virgo rising, often the partner actually makes the money the Virgo doesn’t. They end up doing services, but their partner tends to make more money or they make the same as their partner.”
The Flow:
“It tends to fluctuate, but they tend to be able to skate by if they’re in a lower class. If they’re in the middle class, they kind of stay like this, upper class like this.”
Alignment Strategy:
“Being able to align themselves with people. Of course, I’m stepping ahead, but align themselves with people is how they change this. They end up doing the same kind of staying even.”
Aesthetic Preferences:
“They love pretty things. They love fashion. They tend to enjoy, which is interesting because Virgo is very particular, but the Libra in the second house would be… Very, they would, they’d be very attracted to things that have a little bit of flair to them, a little bit of elegance to them for sure.”
Double Spending:
Direct Quote:
“And they can spend double by paying for others. That’s the thing for a Virgo rising service to others you’re constantly working for other people constantly helping other people it also shows in your finances where you’re like i’ll get you that drink i’ll pay for this you want to get some appetizer i’ll do it i’ll take…”
The Problem:
“…and then you end up with less money because you end up paying for more people even like it’s not you didn’t need to but you feel like you’re obligated because you enjoy being of service to other people”
Ways to Generate Money
Fashion & Beauty:
Direct Quote:
“Now, the ways to generate more money here, fashion and beauty. Those are the first ones. Fashion, beauty, and design. Anything that is design related would be here, especially anything where you have to do like the details or anything like this.”
Mediation Work:
Direct Quote:
“I see a lot of Virgos that are You know, I see a lot of Virgo rising that end up being executives because they end up doing mediation as the way that they make money. They’re like the middle person to somebody.”
Executive Assistant Role:
“That’s really what a secretary is in a lot of these places: they end up doing the Gemini work up here where they’re doing all the communication, answering the emails, doing all that, all the stuff on the phone. And then they’re mediating. So, this between themselves or the customer and the CEO, the person who wants to get a hold of the person that they’re working for, they end up being mediator. And that’s another way that this tends to play up. It’s not listed on here.”
Partnership:
Direct Quote:
“But fashion and beauty is definitely one. Through partnership. Partnership is amazing for Virgos.”
The Libra Challenge:
“And a lot of Virgos feel because they feel like they need to be of service to others that they don’t end up getting this equality thing. And that’s kind of a thing with Libra that some people don’t realize that Libra is about balance and fairness. but never is. And that’s the unfortunate thing is that it should be, and they strive towards it, but it’s very difficult to attain.”
Finding Balance:
“However, they need to find and strike balance with other people to be able to utilize assets and kind of pull all that together so that they can find their fairness and their level of money that comes through partnership, but gives them a comfortable lifestyle because they also want that. With a Venus ruled second house, they also want comfort. They want to be comfortable. They want to have what they want. They want to make sure that they’re not, that they feel balanced.”
The Comfort Zone:
Direct Quote:
“A lot of Virgo risings actually feel comfortable when they’re not rich. You know, obviously the planetary placements will all change this, but they like to just be level. That’s what they’re seeking is balance and harmony.”
Legal Work:
Direct Quote:
“Legal work is huge for Virgo risings. I also see them in law firms and whatnot. Being able to step it up and be the service to the client rather than service to the firm. That’s the key for a lot of them.”
Career Progression:
“Not everybody wants to do that. Some people like their nine to five. Some people want to stay at that certain role. But a lot of these Virgo risings do, especially because in a lot of the charts that I do, the time frame tends to be A. Chiron and Taurus things where they don’t value their contributions, they have lower self-worth, insecurities with money and things like that. So a lot of these Virgo rising should be taking the step and elevating themselves a bit.”
Multitasking Strength:
“And they’re so good at multitasking. And being able to balance all of that out if they’re able to create a career with this Gemini energy in the 10th house so that they are multitasking and doing different things, whether that’s in one job or juggling a couple of businesses that maybe they have.”
Business Reluctance:
Direct Quote:
“And they tend not to start their own businesses with this Pisces in seventh house. If they do, it’s usually something that inspires creativity. So you end up seeing Virgo Risings being like organizers, professional organizers, something like that, where they get to be creative. And it’s not really a job that has much structure.”
Exception:
“Obviously, that can change if, for example, Neptune is in Capricorn or if you have certain other placements. But that tends to be kind of it.”
Music Example:
“A lot of Virgo Risings that get into music, if they start their own business, they kind of do their own thing where they’re either musicians or with that 10th house in Gemini. Do like the technical side of it where they’re producing or something along those lines.”
Legal Redux:
“But legal work is huge because labor rules and legal stuff.”
The Core Need:
Direct Quote:
“And, like I said before, finding stability, finding that balance between what you put out and what you get back. That is the main key for Virgo Risings when it comes to money: making sure that you are not doing, doing, doing being of service all the time and not being compensated for it. Making sure you find that stability. Make sure you are receiving the money.”
Chiron Warning:
“If you couple this with a Chiron and Taurus, it makes it very difficult. You’re going to have to work on both your Chiron and Taurus and your Libra in the second house to rectify this and remedy this.”
________________


LIBRA RISING
Second House: Scorpio
Money Ruler: Pluto
Relationship with Money
The Disappearing Act:
Direct Quote:
“Libra rising. So that means the second house is in Scorpio. The money ruler is wherever Pluto sits in the chart, which will add context to all of this. The relationship is that money disappears. I hear a lot of people with Pluto in the second house or, you know, Scorpio as a second house ruler because there are Libra risings. That’s like money just. There’s always a reason why I can’t hold on to it.”
Debt Pattern:
“Or they end up, here it is, usually easily in debt. So they have a really hard time not going after the lavish things, not going after they can obsess over luxury with that Taurus in the eighth house here and end up getting themselves quite in debt.”
Dependency:
Direct Quote:
“The money tends to come from other people. A lot of Libra rising charts, it’s always they end up partnering because that’s natural for Libra. They find themselves through partnerships and they end up partnering and their money comes through shared resources, mostly from their partner.”
The Core Problem:
“Unsure how to make money on their own is a side effect of that. They tend to like Pluto, it’s hidden, it’s mysterious. They’re not really sure where it comes from or how to get it. It just feels unattainable.”
The Irony:
Direct Quote:
“And this is a hard one for Libra rising, I think, because Pluto in and of itself is a difficult placement, a difficult… planet to harbor because it is chaos and mayhem and the ruler of the underworld and things that go awry and all that. And it does involve other people. And Libra should be really aware that the other people are significant in there.”
The Paradox:
“They have this feeling like they’re so used to partnership and dealing with other people, but they want to make their own money. And it’s ironic that because Scorpio is there, that money actually has to come from other people as well. It’s just a matter of how you do that. You can still make your own money by using other people’s resources.”
Ways to Generate Money
Insurance & Debt:
Direct Quote:
“Insurance and debt, especially large ones. People who do like life insurance and all kinds of insurance policies. Libra risings can do a really good job with this because they understand the investment strategy if they learn it, obviously, and it aligns their energies with being able to accumulate this through shared possessions.”
Wealth Management:
Direct Quote:
“Also, wealth management. I hardly ever see Libra risings in wealth management, yet they should be.”
The Perfect Setup:
“You literally have cancer in your 10th house, which has to do with families and home and the authority there. You have your… Taurus, which is your money house in other people’s money. You have Libra, which is you being able to associate with other people. You have Mars, which is you doing something for someone else.”
The Alignment:
“For example, finding yourself within them. It’s like it all aligns, but I don’t see it as much. It’s something that some people should consider if you’re, especially if you’re looking to start your own business, if you have a Mars placement because the seventh house is about starting your own business.”
Family Office Potential:
“If you have a Mars placement that supports it, you could be that type of person that doesn’t, especially if you’re already doing insurance and debt and stuff like that. You could start your own family office and become a wealth manager. And you know how much they make? A lot of money.”
Business:
“So they have that through businesses. Libra risings should be starting their own business. Most Libra Risings, because Aries, again, it depends on how your Mars is placed, but because Aries is in the seventh house, this is entrepreneurship energy going off on your own.”
Home Business:
“And doing your own thing. Being able to work from home is something that most Libra Risings love. Anyway, and being able to start that business finance is the eighth house. I mentioned that earlier in the class here. So you already are set up for that so that you would make money through that.”
Pooling Resources:
“Bringing people together to pool resources, kind of summarizing what I’ve already said here…”
Deep Expertise:
"…and …diving deeper into their chosen field. The more you dive and place value and pull value from something that you’re doing as a Libra rising, the more that you are going to be able to make money from it because you’ll be able to share deeper and dive deeper that other people can’t do.
So a Libra rising’s best option, most Libra rising, is to dive deeper and be able to do more in their chosen field, than anybody else, it makes them stand out, it makes them a household figure, a household name, because they are able to accomplish things that other people in their field are not able to accomplish, and this is where they find your uniqueness and their individuality."
Critical Implementation Note:
 This is the resolution to Libra Rising’s paradox—while money comes through others and shared resources (Scorpio/Pluto), their personal value proposition comes from becoming irreplaceably expert. The instructor emphasizes that depth of expertise compensates for Pluto’s chaotic energy by creating demand that pulls opportunities toward them rather than requiring them to chase opportunities.
Application Specification:
                              * App should track progression of expertise development over time
                              * Flag when transits support deep study vs surface-level work
                              * Identify house placement of Pluto to show WHERE expertise should be developed
                              * Cross-reference with 9th house (higher education) and 3rd house (communication of expertise)

VII. SCORPIO RISING: The Philosophical Opportunist
A. Natal Chart Configuration
Direct Quote:
“Scorpio rising, our second house is in Sagittarius. Sagittarius is ruled by Jupiter. So take a look at your Jupiter placement. A lot of people who are Scorpio risings get lucky unless they have a Jupiter retrograde or adversely aspected Jupiter. They tend to find luck and come across opportunities. Whether they take them or not is a completely different thing.”
Structural Analysis:
                              * Second House: Sagittarius (mutable fire)
                              * Money Ruler: Jupiter (expansion, philosophy, international)
                              * Rising Ruler: Pluto (transformation, intensity, obsession)
                              * Career House (10th): Leo (Sun-ruled—creative authority, leadership)
                              * Work House (6th): Aries (Mars-ruled—pioneering, energetic)
Technical Note: The instructor identifies a critical modifier—“unless they have a Jupiter retrograde or adversely aspected Jupiter.” App must check:
                              1. Jupiter retrograde status (YES/NO)
                              2. Hard aspects to Jupiter (squares, oppositions with orbs)
                              3. Jupiter’s house placement (colors WHERE luck manifests)
________________


B. Relationship with Money: The Jupiter Expansion Paradox
Direct Quote:
"The relationship with money: high highs and lows, low lows. That’s because Jupiter expands. If you’re having a bad streak, Jupiter will expand your bad streak and make it worse. Obviously, if you’re conversely on a high streak, then you will have a high high.
So Jupiter, although seen often as the malefic [NOTE: instructor likely meant ‘benefic’], the great, lucky, abundant planet that it is, there is a downside. It’s also the, especially in the first house or related to your health houses, the planet that can make you gain a lot of weight. Jupiter transits to the first house can do the same thing. So remember that Jupiter just expands a lot.
Oftentimes when something’s going well and Jupiter comes along, then that’s great. If something’s going bad and Jupiter comes along, it makes it exponentially worse."
Critical Warning Implementation:
 Unlike other rising signs where money patterns are more stable (Taurus) or consistently challenging (Libra), Scorpio Rising experiences amplification of current conditions. This requires:
                              1. Momentum Detection Algorithm:

                                 * Track financial trend over last 3-6 months
                                 * When Jupiter transit approaches 2nd house or aspects natal Jupiter:
                                 * IF trend = positive → Flag as “expansion opportunity”
                                 * IF trend = negative → WARNING: “Course correct before Jupiter transit amplifies losses”
                                 2. Jupiter Cycle Tracking:

                                    * 12-year Jupiter return cycle
                                    * Annual Jupiter ingress into money-related houses
                                    * Jupiter-Saturn conjunctions (20-year wealth restructuring)

C. Philosophical Relationship with Money
Direct Quote:
"You tend to have, as a Scorpio rising, your own philosophy about money and life. You think you can dive, as a Scorpio rising, you have dove, dived, whatever, deeper into it, and you have come up with your own philosophy.
Some Scorpio risings have kind of separated themselves from the material world, and they believe money is just a construct, and you don’t need money, and this is why. Other people have developed their own system around how they believe money works. It’s very interesting, but this can lead to a lot of money or no money, and whether or not you’re happy with that or not."
Psychological Profile:
 Scorpio Rising creates personal belief systems about money that may diverge dramatically from mainstream financial advice. This manifests as:
Spectrum of Philosophies:
                                    1. Anti-materialist extreme: “Money is a construct, I reject capitalism, abundance comes from simplicity”
                                    2. Middle ground: “I’ve studied how money works and developed my own investment/earning strategy”
                                    3. Systemization extreme: “I’ve decoded the financial system and created algorithms/methods others don’t know”


App Implementation:
                                    * During onboarding, Scorpio Risings should be asked about their money philosophy
                                    * Chart reading should note: “Your unique philosophy is VALID but must be examined—does it serve your highest vibration or limit you?”
                                    * Reference Jupiter placement to see if philosophy is expansive (well-aspected) or limiting (retrograde/afflicted)

D. Spending Patterns
Direct Quote:
“They tend to spend money on experience. They value experience. They value higher education and learning a bit more than some other people. A lot of Scorpio risings will value education especially one that is going to be family approved, but something that is going to make them stand out and shine in whatever chosen field that they have.”
Spending Priority Hierarchy:
                                    1. Education: Formal degrees, certifications, courses (9th house Sagittarius themes)
                                    2. Experiences: Travel, cultural immersion, transformative events
                                    3. Learning resources: Books, workshops, mentorship programs
                                    4. Things that create distinction: Specialized tools/equipment for their field
Anti-pattern: Scorpio Rising devalues spending on:
                                    * Pure status items (unless education-related)
                                    * Surface-level entertainment
                                    * Things that don’t contribute to expertise development

E. Ways to Generate Money
1. Teaching & Coaching
Direct Quote:
“Now, ways to generate income, teaching and coaching. This has to do with anything that’s online, anything that’s in person. Sometimes it’s fitness related. Remember the other planets all play into it. Sometimes it’s doing the stuff that I do, which is life coaching and mentoring. Anything that’s kind of consultancy-based, that would also be their school teachers, university teachers, anything like that.”
Career Examples:
                                    * School teachers (K-12)
                                    * University professors
                                    * Life coaches
                                    * Business consultants
                                    * Fitness coaches (if Mars/6th house supports)
                                    * Online course creators
                                    * Workshop facilitators
2. Foreign Languages & Cultural Work
Direct Quote:
“Also teaching foreign languages because of the cultural part of this. Foreign lands, something cultural… Foreign lands also says you’re likely to make your money outside of where you were born. Either you’re going to make your money across the country, more than 400 miles away, or literally overseas.”
Geographic Money Pattern:
 Scorpio Rising has a displacement factor for wealth generation:
                                    * Minimum distance: 400+ miles from birthplace
                                    * Optimal: International work or clients
                                    * Why: Sagittarius 2nd house = foreign/distant lands rule money
App Feature Specification:
                                    * Calculate distance between birthplace and current residence
                                    * IF < 400 miles → Suggest: “Your chart indicates financial expansion through relocation or remote work with distant clients”
                                    * Check 9th house planets for additional international indicators
3. Deep Expertise & Obsessive Mastery
Direct Quote:
“The more Scorpio rising dives deeper into their chosen field… The more money they will make because they know more. They learn more. They obsess over what they want. They find their own beliefs. They discard different things and they put it all together.”
The Obsession Advantage:
 Scorpio’s ruling planet Pluto gives capacity for obsessive focus that others can’t match. Combined with Sagittarius 2nd house (learning), this creates:
Mastery Formula:
                                    1. Dive deep into chosen field (Pluto intensity)
                                    2. Learn everything available (Jupiter expansion)
                                    3. Develop personal theories when existing knowledge insufficient (Jupiter philosophy + Pluto transformation)
                                    4. Monetize unique synthesis (know more than anyone else)

F. Instructor’s Personal Example
Direct Quote:
"Now, what’s interesting is I have a Jupiter in Scorpio. So it’s kind of this energy when it comes to how it’s placed and that’s on my IC. So this is all placed like this for me in astrology.
I actually dove so deep into astrology, so deep into film, so deep into art, so deep into even when I sold cell phones for all the major carriers when I went to each one, I knew more than everybody else.
And it’s… You know, you can be called names all day long. You’re a know-it-all, you’re this, you’re that. It doesn’t matter. I did know. I obsessed over it. And what didn’t work, I developed my own theories and philosophies, literally that Jupiter slash Sagittarian energy.
And I pulled that together for astrology. People with Scorpio rising do that same thing for money."
Case Study Analysis:
 The instructor demonstrates the Scorpio Rising / Jupiter-Sagittarius money pattern even without being Scorpio Rising (he has Jupiter in Scorpio):
Evidence of Pattern:
                                    1. Deep obsessive study: Astrology, film, art, cell phone industry
                                    2. Exceeded standard knowledge: “knew more than everybody else”
                                    3. Social criticism for intensity: Called “know-it-all”
                                    4. Developed personal theories: When existing systems insufficient
                                    5. Synthesized unique approach: Created his own astrology teaching method
Application: Scorpio Risings should expect and embrace this pattern, not resist it due to social pressure.

G. Unique Money-Making Systems
Direct Quote:
"They can use this in conjunction with Jupiter, which is their money ruler, to develop their own theories on how money is to be made. So you’ll see a lot of Scorpio risings making money in really weird ways, in taboo ways because that’s what Scorpio rules.
It’s not accepted by the mainstream, but they make their money and you’re just like, ‘I don’t know how you did that.’ They tell you and you’re like, ‘That doesn’t sound right,’ but it is right because they figured it out. It doesn’t sound right because no one else has done it. It’s new and unique."
Taboo/Unconventional Income Streams:
                                    * Methods others haven’t thought of (Sagittarius expansion into unexplored territory)
                                    * Approaches that seem illogical but work (personal philosophy overrides conventional wisdom)
                                    * “Taboo” industries or methods (Scorpio themes: death, sex, occult, transformation, power dynamics)
Examples:
                                    * Tarot/astrology for corporate executives
                                    * Death doula / end-of-life coaching
                                    * Tantric coaching
                                    * Underground/alternative healing modalities
                                    * Crypto trading with personal algorithms
                                    * Teaching “forbidden” or fringe knowledge
________________


H. Opportunity Creation (Especially for Jupiter Retrograde)
Direct Quote:
"Opportunity will show itself often… but especially if they have a Jupiter in retrograde, that Sagittarian ruler in retrograde, they have to create their own opportunities.
And if you have that in your chart, remember I talk about retrograde planets in one of those in the masterclass. It’s all about finding your own luck, finding your own theories, beliefs, and creating your own opportunities. And that will actually bring you wealth as a Scorpio rising."
Jupiter Retrograde Modification:
                                    * Direct Jupiter: Opportunities come naturally, must be recognized and seized
                                    * Retrograde Jupiter: Must generate opportunities through:
                                    * Creating content that attracts opportunities
                                    * Building systems that generate leads/clients
                                    * Developing expertise so rare that opportunities seek them
                                    * Networking in unconventional spaces
App Alert for Jupiter Retrograde Scorpio Rising:
 “Your Jupiter retrograde means you won’t stumble into opportunities—you must CREATE them through deep expertise, unique systems, and proactive positioning. This is not a limitation but a gift: the opportunities you create will be more aligned than random luck.”

VIII. SAGITTARIUS RISING: The Late-Blooming Authority
A. Natal Chart Configuration
Direct Quote:
"Sagittarius rising. The second house is Capricorn. Capricorn is ruled by Saturn. So the money ruler is Saturn, wherever Saturn sits there.
Now, what’s interesting about Sag rising is that because Saturn rules your second house, Saturn also rules your career. So literally your career will bring you money as a Sagittarius rising, whatever that is."
Structural Advantage:
 This is one of the most aligned rising signs for money-career connection because:
                                    * Second House: Capricorn (Saturn)
                                    * Tenth House: Libra (Venus) - but Saturn is exalted in Libra
                                    * Saturn rules BOTH money (2nd) and career (10th by traditional ruler)
Result: Career success directly translates to financial success without the disconnect some signs experience (e.g., Libra Rising whose career may not generate personal wealth).
Technical Implementation:
 App should highlight this alignment: “Your career and money are unified—focusing on career advancement directly increases wealth. No need to separate ‘passion project’ from ‘money job.’”
________________


B. Saturn Retrograde Modification
Direct Quote:
“And if your Saturn is in retrograde, you have to figure out what that is for yourself, often developing your own goals, your own ambitions, your own sense of discipline and authority and create your own world, basically.”
Saturn Retrograde Pattern:
                                    * Direct Saturn: Traditional career ladder, established goals work well
                                    * Retrograde Saturn: Must define success personally:
                                    * Standard corporate path feels misaligned
                                    * Need to build own structure/business
                                    * Authority comes from self-discipline, not external validation
                                    * Late blooming intensifies (see below)
________________


C. The Late Bloomer Pattern
Direct Quote:
"Sometimes these are late bloomers. Saturn tends to be a late bloomer, especially if it’s in retrograde, but even when it’s not. So Sagittarius rising people tend to, at the beginning of life, seem like they don’t know how to make money.
They almost act like they don’t need money because as long as they have enough to get by… They need the basics. They have enough to get by and that often is enough for them."
Three-Phase Money Evolution:
Phase 1: Youth/Early Adulthood (Pre-Saturn Maturity)
                                    * Appearance of not knowing how to make money
                                    * Contentment with minimal income (“just enough to get by”)
                                    * Low material ambition
                                    * Exploratory period
Direct Quote:
“Capricorn energy doesn’t start out this way… But standard speaking, they grow into slow and steady, gets into working hard. So later in life, they’re very hard workers, but they need to find their way. They need to explore. They need to find their place in the world. And then they start putting in the hard work.”
Phase 2: Saturn Maturation (Late 20s - Saturn Return)
                                    * Discovery of “their place in the world”
                                    * Commitment to specific path
                                    * Development of work ethic
                                    * Slow, steady approach solidifies
Phase 3: Post-Saturn Return (30+)
                                    * “Very hard workers”
                                    * Financial success through discipline
                                    * Authority in chosen field
                                    * Long-term stability
App Feature - Age-Based Messaging:
                                    * Ages 18-28 (Sag Rising): “You’re in the exploration phase. Don’t stress about low income—this is your time to find your path. Financial success comes after age 29.”
                                    * Ages 29-35: “Saturn maturation phase—commit to your path now. Hard work during this period sets up lifelong wealth.”
                                    * Ages 36+: “Reaping rewards of Saturn discipline. Focus on long-term stability and authority building.”

D. Relationship with Money: Stability-Oriented
Direct Quote:
"Working hard, slow and steady. These are all, again, if there’s no adverse traits or anything like that. But again, it’s also like they kind of have to grow into this.
They come a lot of their money comes through older systems and traditions, so they end up kind of aligning with their own beliefs. Then they go back and find what like systems and jobs in play are going to allow them to do the thing that they do."
Money Philosophy:
 Unlike Scorpio Rising (which creates new systems), Sagittarius Rising:
                                    1. Explores various philosophies/approaches (Sagittarius Rising nature)
                                    2. Identifies personal beliefs about what matters
                                    3. Finds existing systems that align with those beliefs
                                    4. Works within those structures long-term
Example:
                                    * Believes in environmental sustainability (personal philosophy)
                                    * Finds career in established environmental organization (existing system)
                                    * Climbs ladder within that system (Capricorn 2nd house discipline)
                                    * Doesn’t need to start own eco-company (unlike Aquarius or Aries Rising might)
________________


E. Alignment with Tradition vs. Innovation
Direct Quote:
"Sagittarius rising, unless they have certain traits and whatnot, they’re not usually the ones who go out and like reinvent the wheel and, you know, do like entrepreneur stuff that no one else has done. They tend to do things that are services that come from some sort of history, some sort of authority, some sort of, they bring all that in there.
Second, sixth, and tenth houses are all earth houses. It’s very much rooted in stability and security. But they will find their own spin on it. And that’s what Sagittarius is all about. Finding their own experience and what they feel like they want to do to have stories to tell to be able to kind of expand on that."
Innovation Pattern:
                                    * NOT: Create entirely new industry/method (Aquarius Rising)
                                    * BUT: Take established method and expand/improve it
Direct Quote:
“They may take something that is already out there and, while they’re not reinventing on it, they are expanding upon it and they are adding what they can bring to the table to it to make that thing a better thing.”
Example Applications:
                                    * Traditional teacher who develops innovative curriculum
                                    * Lawyer who creates new legal strategies within existing law
                                    * Doctor who expands standard protocols with holistic additions
                                    * Financial advisor who combines traditional investing with ethical screening

F. Ways to Generate Money
1. Climbing the Ladder
Direct Quote:
"Ways to generate income are climbing the ladder. These are the type of people that will literally, once they find what they’re looking for and they found their place in the world, they’re looking for that experience. They will take all the experience and all the steps to climb up to the top.
And you may see them as either CEOs or just under. I see a lot of Sag rising is like vice presidents and stuff like that."
Career Trajectory:
                                    1. Find right organization/field
                                    2. Start at appropriate entry level
                                    3. Methodically gain experience at each level
                                    4. Accept promotions/advancement
                                    5. Reach senior leadership (CEO, VP, Senior Partner, etc.)
Why “Just Under” CEO?
 The instructor notes many Sag Risings are VPs rather than CEOs—this may be because:
                                    * 10th house in Libra (partnership-oriented, not solo authority)
                                    * Saturn prefers structure over spotlight
                                    * VP role offers authority without total exposure
________________


2. Structure in Utilizing Systems
Direct Quote:
"We see structure in utilizing systems. A lot of them are smart enough to understand that if I want to make an abundance of money using my Jupiter, that I need to use the systems in play, the financial systems.
This is where finance actually plays in with Capricorn and Saturn, is when it’s sitting in the second house and relating to Venus in any way. So financial systems—these are stock market players, these are portfolio, you know, people who hold portfolios, these are gamblers and risk takers."
Financial System Mastery:
                                    * Stock market investing/trading
                                    * Portfolio management
                                    * Systematic gambling (poker, sports betting with models)
                                    * Any field with learnable rules/patterns
Key Distinction:
                                    * Sagittarius Rising: Learns THE SYSTEM, then plays within it masterfully
                                    * Aquarius Rising: Tries to disrupt/replace the system
                                    * Scorpio Rising: Creates personal system that ignores mainstream
Direct Quote:
“They play the stock market. They know the systems and it doesn’t have to be just stocks. It can be anything that has a system. They will learn it and they will try to find a way to use it in their benefit too, to give themselves more. Sagittarius wants more.”

3. Finding Authority in Money Streams
Direct Quote:
"Finding authority in money streams. This is where they find something that not only gives them stability, because that’s extremely important, and structure and foundation, but something that other people appreciate them for and they get respect for. And that’s what they’re seeking with money.
So that’s what they tend to align with when it’s on the positive here."
Money + Respect = Sagittarius Rising Fulfillment
Must have BOTH:
                                    * Financial stability (Saturn need)
                                    * Social respect/authority (Sagittarius need for reputation, Jupiter desire for expansion of influence)
Career Red Flags:
                                    * High-paying but socially devalued work (feels empty)
                                    * Respected but low-paying work (financial stress)
                                    * Need intersection of both factors
________________


4. Setting Up Long-Term Goals
Direct Quote:
"And setting up long-term goals. So they end up, sometimes they’ll play the short game, but a lot of these people, especially if they’re in a stock market or whatever, they’re not looking to be day traders as much as they are looking for patterns and how things play out through international.
They’re looking at the big picture. They tend to see things as they play out the long way. So if you’re getting into financing of any way, then you should be, as a Sagittarius rising, you should be looking at the long game. And that would bring you the most income is not playing the short game unless your energy favors it."
Investment Strategy:
                                    * NOT: Day trading (Gemini/Virgo approach)
                                    * YES: Long-term holds, pattern recognition, international diversification
                                    * Time Horizon: Years to decades, not days to weeks
App Investment Guidance:
 “As Sagittarius Rising, your wealth builds through patient, long-term strategies. Avoid get-rich-quick schemes. Your Saturn-ruled money house rewards discipline over decades.”

IX. CAPRICORN RISING: The Tech Innovator
A. Natal Chart Configuration
Direct Quote:
“Capricorn rising, second house is Aquarius. Aquarius is ruled by Uranus, so obviously wherever Uranus is in your chart, we’ll add more along with Venus.”
Structural Analysis:
                                    * Second House: Aquarius (Uranus-ruled, fixed air)
                                    * Sixth House: Gemini (Mercury-ruled, mutable air)
                                    * Tenth House: Libra (Venus-ruled, cardinal air)
                                    * ALL money-related houses are AIR signs
Implication: Capricorn Rising’s money comes through ideas, innovation, communication, networking, technology—not physical labor or traditional business.
________________


B. Relationship with Money: Come and Go Pattern
Direct Quote:
"The relationship for Capricorn rising with Aquarius is that money seems to come and go. It’s like no matter how hard they work for it, money just kind of like, either they spend it or they go through periods of time where they have work, they don’t have work.
And that’s because the air signs in the second, sixth, and tenth house are like, they’re ready, they want to work, assuming that their Saturn is well-aspected. But finding the thing that doesn’t make them bored and where they feel at peace and balanced and accepted can be very difficult for them. So they tend to jump jobs and try different things."
Income Instability Causes:
1. Uranus Volatility:
                                    * Sudden income influxes
                                    * Unexpected losses or expenses
                                    * Freelance/project-based income (not salary)
                                    * Cryptocurrency-type volatility
2. Boredom Factor:
                                    * Air signs need mental stimulation
                                    * Repetitive work = quitting
                                    * Constant job-hopping damages income continuity
3. Saturn Strength Modifier:
Direct Quote:
“If they have a stronger Saturn, they will not have the downtime as much, but if they have a weaker or retrograde or whatever Saturn in there, then you may see people with the Aquarius in the second house having a lot of downtime between jobs.”
App Implementation:
 Check Saturn condition:
                                    * Strong Saturn (exalted in Libra, in Capricorn, well-aspected): Income gaps are shorter, more discipline during transitions
                                    * Weak Saturn (fall in Aries, retrograde, afflicted): WARNING: “Expect significant downtime between jobs—build 6-12 month emergency fund”
________________


C. Spending Patterns: The Authority Figure
Direct Quote:
"They tend to spend on their friends. It’s very important. They have the authority. They feel like they’re the man. Sometimes they play that role a little bit too much. They’ll get their little posse together, their team, their groups. They’ll buy everybody shots at the bar. They’ll, you know, buy gifts. They’ll do different things, and they tend to have less money as a result of this.
Obviously, if their chart is the other way around, they try to mooch off their friends, but that’s a whole different thing."
Spending Psychology:
 Capricorn Rising seeks authority and leadership (Saturn/Capricorn nature) but in Aquarius 2nd house, this manifests as:
Two Extremes:
1. The Benefactor (Well-aspected):
                                    * Pays for group activities
                                    * Buys rounds of drinks
                                    * Gifts for friend group
                                    * Financially supports their “team”
                                    * Problem: Overspending leaves them broke
2. The Moocher (Afflicted):
                                    * Expects friends to cover expenses
                                    * Leverages group connections for free resources
                                    * Still sees self as “leader” but financially dependent
App Financial Planning Note:
 “Your chart shows tendency to overspend on social groups. Set ‘friend budget’ limit to maintain financial stability while honoring your generous nature.”
________________


D. Innovation-Seeking & Change
Direct Quote:
"They’re looking for new ways to make money. That’s the thing about Capricorns. And a lot of people associate Capricorns with money. It’s not directly, but a Capricorn rising is always looking for the next thing. They’re the ones who are like, ‘Oh, cryptocurrency. It’s like, it’s a system I identify with, but this is the new way to do it.’
That’s kind of how it is with Aquarius in the second house as a Capricorn rising. And constant change in jobs and sources is because the Gemini in the sixth house, because you have Uranus as the planet ruler, you’re always looking for change. Each one of those changes is really trying to find yourself and figure out your uniqueness."
The New System Seeker:
Capricorn (Saturn) provides ability to understand systems
+
Aquarius (Uranus) provides drive to find NEWER systems
Early adopter of innovative money-making methods
Examples:
                                    * First in friend group to trade crypto
                                    * Early NFT adopter
                                    * Beta tester for new platforms
                                    * Tries new gig economy apps before mainstream
WHY the Constant Change?
 Not flakiness—it’s a search for authentic uniqueness:
Direct Quote:
“Because you have Uranus as the planet ruler, you’re always looking for change. Each one of those changes is really trying to find yourself and figure out your uniqueness.”
________________


E. The Capricorn Work Trap
Direct Quote:
"If you end up as a Capricorn Rising doing Capricorn type stuff, just standard CEO stuff, standard hard work, labor work, anything like that, you’re going to find as a Capricorn rising, that you’re just not going to be happy. You’re going to constantly want to quit, do another job, find another way to transfer, try this over here, do that, because you’re seeking how you can have value in your uniqueness and what you bring individually to the table.
If it’s a type of job where you were hired for your skills that no one else has, you’re gonna be a lot happier."
Critical Career Guidance:
AVOID (Despite being Capricorn Rising):
                                    * Traditional corporate ladder climbing
                                    * Standard CEO roles
                                    * Labor-intensive work
                                    * Jobs where you’re replaceable
SEEK:
                                    * Roles requiring unique skillset
                                    * Positions where YOU specifically were needed
                                    * Work that highlights individual contribution
                                    * Jobs others can’t easily do
This is paradoxical because Capricorn is associated with traditional career success, BUT Aquarius 2nd house overrides this—must be unique even within structure.

F. Ways to Generate Money
1. Tech and Online
Direct Quote:
“Ways to generate money: tech, tech and online. So cryptocurrency, anything that is technology-based, anything that’s like online, social media, you know, diving deep with that kind of stuff and finding a way to transmute that into something that is what you want.”
Career Examples:
                                    * Cryptocurrency trading/investing
                                    * Blockchain development
                                    * Online businesses (e-commerce, SaaS, apps)
                                    * Social media management/strategy
                                    * Tech startups
                                    * Digital products
                                    * Software development
2. Social Media (With Caveats)
Direct Quote:
"Because Scorpio in the 11th house with social media for a Capricorn rising is not traditionally the thing they want to do. But if they find a way to kind of like see the hidden value in it and find a way to use that, then they will do it as well.
Capricorn rising tends to not do it depends on where the sun is, and all these things. But just blanket statement doesn’t want to show their face on camera anyway. On social media, they tend to do things where they can promote whatever they’re doing in a new, inventive, and creative way where they are not necessarily putting themselves on camera like everybody else."
Social Media Strategy for Capricorn Rising:
NOT:
                                    * Influencer showing their face constantly
                                    * Personal brand centered on personality
                                    * Daily vlogs/lifestyle content
YES:
                                    * Behind-the-scenes business promotion
                                    * Innovative marketing that doesn’t require face
                                    * Anonymous/pseudonymous accounts
                                    * Faceless YouTube channels
                                    * Brand accounts (not personal)
                                    * Creative content that stands apart from typical influencer style
Why? Scorpio in 11th house (social media/networking house):
                                    * Privacy-oriented
                                    * Doesn’t want public exposure
                                    * Prefers mysterious/hidden approach
________________


3. Sources That Fluctuate
Direct Quote:
“Sources that fluctuate. This, again, could be cryptocurrency. It could be anything that has to do with digital currency. It could have to do with anything that’s tech-related. Anything that has a value that’s not constant the entire time. There’s a lot of Capricorn in the stock market as well.”
Income Sources:
                                    * Volatile investments (crypto, stocks, options)
                                    * Freelance/contract work (income varies monthly)
                                    * Project-based consulting
                                    * Commission-based sales
                                    * Anything with non-fixed income
Financial Planning Requirement:
 MUST have substantial emergency fund due to income volatility.
________________


4. Automation and Future-Proofing
Direct Quote:
"Automation and future-proofing. This is all about, again, diving deep into how we can utilize technology within the way that we make money, how we can bring in networking groups, teams. Small businesses, all of that, into here.
Anything, again, future-proofing, anything this technology is going to bring it in that’s going to create security is another way."
Future-Proof Career Strategy:
                                    * Build automated income systems (passive income through tech)
                                    * Develop skills that won’t be easily replaced by AI
                                    * Network with tech-forward groups
                                    * Create small businesses using latest technology
                                    * Position in industries that will grow (not decline)
App Career Guidance:
 “As Capricorn Rising, focus on automation and future-proof skills. Learn: AI, blockchain, no-code tools, digital marketing systems. Build: automated revenue streams, scalable digital products.”

X. AQUARIUS RISING: The Creative Dreamer
A. Natal Chart Configuration
Direct Quote:
“Aquarius rising. Second house is Pisces. Pisces is ruled by Neptune. So look for Neptune in the chart for further information.”
Structural Analysis:
                                    * Second House: Pisces (Neptune-ruled, mutable water)
                                    * Sixth House: Cancer (Moon-ruled, cardinal water)
                                    * Tenth House: Scorpio (Pluto-ruled, fixed water)
                                    * ALL money/work houses are WATER signs
Implication: Money comes through intuition, creativity, spirituality, emotion, behind-the-scenes work—the most “non-material” configuration for material resources.
________________


B. Relationship with Money: The Illusion Problem
Direct Quote:
"The relationship, some Aquarius rising people, because they are future-oriented, they’re all about society, humanitarianism, and how they kind of are the future in some ways, and in some ways they are. Because that Pisces in the second house, when it comes to values, possessions, and money, oftentimes they feel like they don’t need money.
You know, it’s the future. It’s unnecessary. I’m unconventional. I don’t go with the norm. And they can see money as a more Capricorn thing. Whereas Uranus, yeah, Uranus, which rules Aquarius, Aquarius is trying to be different, trying to rebel. I don’t need money."
The Future-Oriented Rejection:
Aquarius Rising identity = future, humanitarian, unconventional
+
Pisces 2nd house = transcendence of material
“Money is unnecessary/old paradigm thinking”
The Practical Consequence:
Direct Quote:
"Oftentimes they end up having a hard time keeping money and having a hard time materializing money. Because Pisces is in that second house. I can almost feel like money’s never there and I don’t know how to get it.
It’s like every time it’s like right out of my grasp or every time I think I have it, it’s an illusion. It just disappears. It’s a disappearance in a different way than when Scorpio was in this house, but it can feel like it’s very hard to attain."
Neptune’s Money Illusions:
1. The Vanishing Act:
                                    * Think you have $X in account
                                    * Check balance: significantly less
                                    * Can’t remember where it went
                                    * Genuinely confused about spending
2. The Mirage:
                                    * Opportunity seems real and promising
                                    * Upon closer inspection, it doesn’t materialize
                                    * Income you thought was coming doesn’t arrive
                                    * “Right out of grasp” feeling
3. The Dissociation:
                                    * Lose track of what they have
                                    * Assume more money than actual
                                    * Suddenly realize they’re broke
                                    * “Should have had more money” confusion
Direct Quote:
“If they do have it, it’s almost like they lose track of what they have. And then all of a sudden it feels like they should have had more money, but now they’re out of money.”
________________


C. Spiritual Connection to Material World
Direct Quote:
"And then there’s a spiritual connection to the material world. When they go too far into the Pisces, they end up losing the connection to the material world.
If they have a spiritual connection to the material world, sometimes it can be a little bit too much where they over-idolize money. So it can be not only that they don’t unless they do or they want badly. Sometimes they can see that money is a like an idealistic thing, like perfection. That’s the one thing that everybody needs, right?"
The Spiritual-Material Spectrum:
Extreme 1: Material Rejection
                                    * “Money is ego/illusion/maya”
                                    * Spiritual bypassing of financial responsibility
                                    * Result: Poverty, financial chaos
Extreme 2: Material Over-Idealization
                                    * Money becomes spiritual goal
                                    * “Abundance mindset” taken to extreme
                                    * Money = worthiness, enlightenment, perfection
                                    * Result: Disappointment when money doesn’t solve spiritual emptiness
Healthy Middle Ground:
                                    * Money is a tool in material reality
                                    * Spiritual connection helps intuition guide finances
                                    * Neither rejection nor worship

"Now, to be able to use this energy and generate money: creativity. Aquarius Rising is all about using your individuality and making money through creative endeavors, spiritual work, anything that’s behind the scenes and anything that’s medically related. All that Pisces energy.
This includes dance. It includes a lot of people who have this are set up especially with the way that the generational planets have been lately for video games. This literally right here could be video games depending on where Uranus and Neptune are both situated in chart and how they’re aspected. This could be one way that they do it."

E. Film and Entertainment
Direct Quote:
“A lot of Aquarius rising in film and entertainment as well, especially if they’re kind of like doing their own thing, especially with that seventh house Leo here and then looking at their sun placement for further.”
Why Film/Entertainment?
                                    * 7th house in Leo (creativity, performance, entertainment)
                                    * Need for creative self-expression (Aquarius)
                                    * Behind-the-scenes comfort (Pisces 2nd)
                                    * “Doing their own thing” (not corporate entertainment)
Examples:
                                    * Independent filmmakers
                                    * Indie musicians
                                    * Underground artists
                                    * Alternative entertainment
                                    * Experimental media

F. The Mysterious/Taboo Element
Direct Quote:
“It is water so using intuition, using, um, you know, their gut feelings and doing things differently that are having that mysterious, like, taboo element of it that… not really sure what they’re doing or how they’re doing it, but they’re making it work. Those types of people generate a lot of money doing that.”
The Mystique Advantage:
 People can’t quite figure out:
                                    * What exactly they do
                                    * How they make money
                                    * What their process is
                                    * Why it works
BUT it does work, and the mystery enhances value.
Examples:
                                    * Artist with unique process no one can replicate
                                    * Healer whose methods seem inexplicable but effective
                                    * Creator whose content is indefinable yet popular
                                    * Consultant whose insights seem to come from nowhere

G. The Intuition Imperative
Direct Quote:
"But again, using creativity is huge for them. And also taking a look, obviously, at the sixth and 10th house placements. But Aquarius Rising is all about using your intuition to guide you as well into what is a good investment, what is a bad investment.
If I buy something, is it worth it? Use your intuition. Your intuition will tell you, ‘I shouldn’t buy this.’ I don’t know why, but I feel like I could either get a better deal or there’s something wrong with this or whatever.
Listen to that because that’s all part of your Earth houses are water ruled. So it’s all about intuition and using that for guidance."
Intuition as Financial Guidance System:
Money Houses (2nd, 6th, 10th) = Water Signs:
                                    * 2nd house: Pisces (Neptune intuition)
                                    * 6th house: Cancer (Moon emotional knowing)
                                    * 10th house: Scorpio (Pluto gut instinct)
Application:
                                    * Before purchase: “Does this feel right?”
                                    * Investment decisions: Trust gut over spreadsheet
                                    * Career choices: “Does this align with my knowing?”
                                    * Money opportunities: “Something feels off” = don’t proceed
App Feature:
 “Before financial decisions, your chart indicates checking in with intuition. Pause, feel into the decision, trust your gut—it’s your most accurate financial tool.”

XI. PISCES RISING: The Driven Seeker
A. Natal Chart Configuration
Direct Quote:
“Pisces rising. Second house is in Aries, which is Mars ruled. So Mars in the chart is going to tell you more about how you make money and your relationship with money.”
Structural Analysis:
                                    * Second House: Aries (Mars-ruled, cardinal fire)
                                    * Sixth House: Leo (Sun-ruled, fixed fire)
                                    * Tenth House: Sagittarius (Jupiter-ruled, mutable fire)
                                    * ALL money/work houses are FIRE signs
Implication: Money comes through action, creativity, passion, self-expression, bold moves—but filtered through Neptune’s dreamy, uncertain lens.
________________


B. The Cosmic Paradox
Direct Quote:
"It’s a very selfish placement. Pisces is interesting because it’s very good with the flow, but Aries is the baby doesn’t really know, but wants to do for themselves. So they have this interesting dichotomy toward that feeling of towards enlightenment being Neptune ruled, but then having their values and their sense of like money and finance and everything, tying them to the material world in terms of value being Aries.
And then in their sixth house of the actual material world and work being Leo. So that fire energy is like they have this passion and this creativity and this drive and this motivation to do. But then because they’re Neptune ruled in Pisces rising, they don’t know what to do."
The Internal Conflict:
Pisces Rising (Neptune):
                                    * Seeks transcendence, flow, surrender
                                    * Wants to dissolve ego
                                    * Comfortable with uncertainty
                                    * Spiritual orientation
Aries Second House (Mars):
                                    * Selfish, self-oriented
                                    * Wants personal achievement
                                    * Needs to DO and ACT
                                    * Material orientation
Leo Sixth House (Sun):
                                    * Needs creative expression
                                    * Wants spotlight and recognition
                                    * Passionate about work
                                    * Identity tied to career
Result: “I have SO MUCH drive and passion…but for WHAT?”
________________


C. The Beginning/End Cycle Challenge
Direct Quote:
"And it’s just because that second house there again is Aries starting over with the baby. So it’s like you’re coming in with that ascendant that is at the end of the cycle, and then you’re crossing back over into the beginning.
So it can be very difficult for a lot of Pisces risings to figure out what they do. Once they do, though, they will lock in and they will make a hell of a lot of money. Pisces rising are so underrated, just generically, again, umbrella speaking, because once they figure this out, they’re on their way.
But a lot of their life, some people never do, but a lot of their life, they have a hard time figuring out which way they’re supposed to go."
The Cycle Symbolism:
                                    * Pisces: 12th sign, end of zodiac, dissolution, completion
                                    * Aries: 1st sign, beginning of zodiac, initiation, newness
Translation: Pisces Rising exists at the threshold between endings and beginnings, between dissolution of old and birth of new. Their money house (Aries) is starting fresh, but they’re coming from a place of cosmic completion.
The Unlocking Moment:
 Once direction is found → “lock in” → “make a hell of a lot of money”
Before that moment: Confusion, aimlessness, trying multiple paths
App Messaging:
 “If you haven’t found your path yet, don’t despair—Pisces Rising typically takes longer to discover their direction. Once you do, your fire-house money configuration creates exceptional earning potential. Keep exploring.”

D. The Creative Job Criticism Problem
Direct Quote:
"Pisces rising also has a hard time because everyone tells them they shouldn’t do creative jobs, get a real job. And this is not just Pisces rising. This is other people, especially if you have different configurations in your chart. Creative jobs aren’t real jobs. Music’s not a real job. This is not a real job, not a real job.
And they hear that and they feel that. And they’re so sensitive that it can shut them down. When in reality, if they just listen to themselves for a Pisces rising, they would do much better."
The Sensitivity Factor:
                                    * Pisces = most sensitive rising sign (Neptune, water, mutable)
                                    * Creative fire energy NEEDS expression (2nd, 6th, 10th all fire)
                                    * External criticism from family/society = shutting down their actual path
                                    * Result: Pisces Rising abandons creative careers for “practical” jobs where they wither
Cultural Programming:
                                    * “Music isn’t a real job”
                                    * “Art doesn’t pay the bills”
                                    * “Get something stable”
                                    * “You need a backup plan”
Effect on Pisces Rising:
 Takes this criticism to heart, suppresses natural gifts, ends up in unfulfilling “practical” work, never makes significant money because they’re OFF path.
App Career Counseling:
 “Your chart shows creative careers are your TRUE money path, despite what others say. The ‘practical’ advice you’ve received is blocking your wealth. Creative work isn’t a backup—it’s your primary route to financial success.”

E. Relationship with Money
Direct Quote:
"The relationship is driven, but aimless. It’s like, ‘I know I want to do, but I don’t know what.’ They can make money when they need to. It’s like they have this mysterious ability that if they really need to make money, they can find something, make a little bit of money, whatever they need for the time being. And then they’re kind of back to the same situation again.
All they have to do is channel that into something they really want to do instead of something that is just going to help them in their situation."
The Manifestation-on-Demand Ability:
 Pisces Rising has strange capacity to:
                                    * Need money urgently
                                    * Suddenly find way to make it (gig, odd job, sale, etc.)
                                    * Crisis averted
                                    * Return to aimlessness
The Problem: This ability becomes a crutch preventing them from committing to a real path.
The Solution: Channel that same manifestation ability into their actual passion instead of just survival mode.
________________


F. Spending Patterns
Direct Quote:
"They tend to have an ability to spend money quickly, impulsively, and selfishly. I want this for me. I like this. I don’t care. I don’t have any of the details about this. I just think I like it. And they take it.
Oftentimes they ignore their intuition on what’s a good purchase and what’s a bad purchase because that Aries takes over and it’s like, ‘I want it. I want it.’ And then they don’t always know how to make money, which we kind of talked about before."
Impulsive Spending Pattern:
                                    * See something → Want it → Buy it (Aries impulse)
                                    * No research or comparison
                                    * “I like it” is sufficient justification
                                    * Selfish orientation (“for me”)
Intuition Override:
 Unlike Aquarius Rising (who should use intuition), Pisces Rising has intuition but ignores it when Aries impulse kicks in.
Neptune intuition says: “This isn’t a good purchase”
Aries Mars says: “I WANT IT NOW”
Result: Buy it anyway, regret later
Financial Consequence:
 Can’t build wealth because money earned = immediately spent impulsively.

G. Ways to Generate Money
1. Doing Something New
Direct Quote:
"How do they generate money? Doing something new. Do something that’s different. Use your intuition as inspiration. Take clues and cues from the universe and the environment to guide you.
Pisces is an ethereal sign as a rising sign. Aries is pioneering. It’s new. It’s the new cycle. Stop trying to do what everybody else is doing. Do your own thing. Come up with new ideas and follow that."
New = Aries = 1st Sign Energy:
                                    * Pioneer, not follower
                                    * Initiate, don’t replicate
                                    * Create new offerings
                                    * First in a space (or create entirely new space)
Intuition as Guide:
                                    * Neptune Rising: receive universal downloads
                                    * Follow inspired ideas
                                    * Trust “clues and cues” from environment
                                    * Don’t force logical business plans if intuition says otherwise
________________


2. Be the Boss
Direct Quote:
"Be the boss. Pisces rising is sensitive, but they are very different type of boss. They are a good, compassionate boss when they’re doing their own thing. They can be very meticulous with the people that they’re working with, but they can be very expansive and philosophical as a mentor or as a boss.
They’re very good at coaching other people, which is a very different type of authority than, let’s say, Capricorn there or even Leo there."
Leadership Style:
                                    * NOT: Authoritarian (Capricorn)
                                    * NOT: Charismatic spotlight (Leo)
                                    * YES: Compassionate, mentoring, expansive, philosophical
Career Applications:
                                    * Life coach / spiritual mentor
                                    * Creative director (with supportive style)
                                    * Entrepreneur (own business)
                                    * Consultant (guiding others)
                                    * Teacher (with mentorship approach)
Why Boss vs Employee?
 Aries 2nd house = needs autonomy in money-making
Leo 6th house = needs creative freedom in daily work
Both clash with hierarchical employment
________________


3. Solo Acts & Hands-On Work
Direct Quote:
"Anything that has to do with solo acts, things that you can do for yourself, especially if it’s creative or spiritual in nature, hands-on approach, this is definitely going to be the way forward for you, being engaged interactive in what you’re doing.
Sometimes even physically doing the grunt work yourself at least for some of it."
Solo Work Examples:
                                    * Solo artist/musician/performer
                                    * Independent creator
                                    * Freelance creative professional
                                    * Spiritual practitioner
                                    * One-person business
Hands-On Requirement:
 Despite Neptune’s ethereal nature, Aries + Leo need physical engagement:
                                    * Painting, sculpting (not just conceptualizing)
                                    * Playing instrument (not just composing)
                                    * Hands-on client work (not just strategy)
                                    * Physically creating (not just delegating)
________________


4. You ARE the Product
Direct Quote:
"Remember that Pisces rising can also be the product. You can promote yourself as the thing. Leo in the sixth house is all about creativity and whatnot, but they like the spotlight. Generically speaking, they want to be in the spotlight.
So the best way you can do this as a Pisces rising is to go sing, be on Broadway, go dance, go use your creativity. And obviously, it doesn’t have to be the normal film, music, whatever. It can also be like making things, designing, painting. There’s so many creative avenues that you can go and the rest of your chart is really gonna narrow it down on how that will play out for you."
Personal Brand Careers:
                                    * Singer/performer (Broadway, concerts)
                                    * Dancer
                                    * Actor
                                    * Painter/visual artist whose work is tied to their identity
                                    * Designer with signature style
                                    * Content creator (if Sun/Leo supports)
The Leo 6th House Factor:
 Unlike Capricorn Rising (avoids camera) or Aquarius Rising (behind-scenes), Pisces Rising with Leo 6th house wants spotlight in their daily work.
Creative Career Examples:
                                    * Traditional: Singer, Broadway, film, music, dance
                                    * Non-traditional: Making physical products, designing, painting, sculpture, crafts, artisan work
Chart Customization:
 “Rest of your chart” determines WHICH creative avenue—look to:
                                    * Mars placement (energy expression)
                                    * Sun placement (identity/spotlight preference)
                                    * Venus placement (aesthetic inclinations)

XII. CELEBRITY CHART EXAMPLES
After completing the 12 rising sign analyses, the instructor provides three detailed celebrity examples to demonstrate how these principles manifest in real-world success.
________________


A. DR. DRE: Cancer Rising (Implied)
Chart Configuration Highlighted
Direct Quote:
"Dr. Dre here, and I’m not going to go through everything. Remember that your Saturn placement, your Capricorn, your 10th house, your 6th house, your 2nd house, your 1st house all matter.
Saturn in Pisces, you already know that this guy’s into music and whatnot. But Saturn up here though I won’t go too much into Saturn placements for these just want to touch on it real quick. Saturn in the 10th house as well is kind of like that leader who has the authority within music."
Key Placements:
                                    * Saturn in Pisces in 10th house: Authority in music, leadership in artistic field
                                    * Chiron: “As he’s had his own issues and whatnot, you know, as a father and things of that nature”
                                    * Second house in Cancer: Empty house (no planets)
                                    * Midheaven in Aquarius: Group work, innovative approach, future-thinking
                                    * Neptune in 6th house: Music in daily work/routine

Money Analysis
Direct Quote:
“Second house in Cancer, empty house. So we don’t have any reverse rulerships to look at here. Cancer, we talked about before. Gemini has to do with using the hands and doing things that are with the midheaven in Aquarius has to do with things that are rhythmic with the combination here.”
Second House Ruler Analysis:
Direct Quote:
“Its ruler is over here in the fifth house so automatically entertainment and this is Libra which has to do with anything that has to do with other people being public facing legal you know all the Leo the the libra stuff that we talked about before and partnerships.”
Translation:
                                    * 2nd house in Cancer = Moon rules money
                                    * Moon in 5th house in Libra = Money through entertainment + partnerships + public work
                                    * Libra = balance, music production, legal contracts, partnerships

Career Evolution
Direct Quote:
“And his first job was a DJ. I did read that while I was putting this all together. I didn’t know that before, but that is right here. His second house ruler of making money. His first job, he went right into, uh, with the public here doing something that was cool. That was like trendy.”
Career Path:
                                    1. DJ (first job)—Moon in Libra (public-facing, music, partnerships)
                                    2. NWA group member—Midheaven in Aquarius (group aspect, revolutionary)
                                    3. Producer (main career)—Behind-scenes work, 12th house Taurus (music business)
                                    4. Mentor (Eminem, 50 Cent, Warren G, etc.)—Saturn in 10th (authority, teaching)
                                    5. Business owner (Beats headphones)—Selling what he built (Gemini, communication/sales)
Direct Quote:
"Neptune in the sixth house brings music back in as well. But this is entertainment in general, doing something that is fun, doing something that he feels like intuitively inclined to do and always partnership.
So if you know anything about Dr. Dre, he obviously had his group NWA when he first started. That’s his midheaven and all this energy in Aquarius. That’s the group aspect here. He also had his one-on-one and his mentorship. So there’s a whole list of people. Obviously, most people know Eminem, but like 50 Cent and Warren G and all the other people that he had.
This is his Saturn in the 10th house in Pisces as a musical mentor. And then the one-on-one aspect where he is a producer. and his uh he owns his own business and that is in music behind the scenes in the 12th house in Taurus so that’s arts music and everything that pulls it back up here to the ninth house where it’s a lot of electronic and whatnot so this is Dr. Dre."
________________


Beats Sale
Direct Quote:
"We also know that he ended up selling, um, selling Gemini right here, sales, selling something that he had helped build up that he had built a name for here in entertainment.
Libra also rules things that are balanced out. Headphones makes a lot of sense for this. And then Midheaven up here in the ninth house was putting his belief in his stamp on something that he ended up selling. So that is, and Venus is there. So that’s also where he made a lot of money."
Beats Headphones Analysis:
                                    * Libra influence: Balance = headphones (left/right balance, audio balance)
                                    * Entertainment connection: Music + technology product
                                    * 9th house: His belief/philosophy stamped on product
                                    * Venus presence: Made significant money from sale (reportedly $3 billion to Apple)
________________


Timing & Progressions
Direct Quote:
"Deciphering when you do something versus when you do something else. Like he did music for a long time as a group. Then he kind of went one-on-one. Then he kind of dropped out. And then he, you know, did the thing with Eminem. Then he did the other stuff. Then he did beats. And now he’s doing other things. That’s all based on progressions and relocations.
If you move your midheaven, you end up changing your jobs. You’ll always have your natal chart, but your relocated chart acts as a layer above it. I teach that in the astrocartography class."
Career Phase Timing:
 Instructor emphasizes that the when of each career phase is determined by:
                                    1. Progressions (internal aging of chart)
                                    2. Relocations (moving changes Midheaven and thus career focus)
Example: Dr. Dre’s move from Compton to different locations would change his Midheaven, shifting career focus from gangsta rap to mainstream production to business.

B. WARREN BUFFETT: Sagittarius Rising (Implied)
Chart Configuration
Direct Quote:
"Warren Buffett. Most people understand Warren Buffett as an investor, a trader. He’s done quite a few things in his life. He’s very diversified in his portfolio, but that’s what he does. Here you go.
Saturn retrograde, finding his own way in the second house in Capricorn, literally trying to be the best, do the most with finance."
Key Placements:
                                    * Saturn retrograde in 2nd house in Capricorn: “Finding his own way” with money, creating personal financial philosophy
                                    * Sun and Neptune in Virgo in 10th house: Career in services, selective, holdings company
                                    * Chiron in 6th house (Taurus): Cannot work standard 9-to-5
________________


Money Upon Money Pattern
Direct Quote:
“And if you look at… Where is it? Oh, here it is. If you look here, that Saturn that is in his second house, that comes from Capricorn, that is already there. So again, money upon money upon money and the authority in it.”
Translation:
                                    * 2nd house = Capricorn (Saturn already there)
                                    * Saturn (money ruler) IN 2nd house (money house)
                                    * = “Money upon money upon money”
                                    * = Finance, banking, value accumulation, authority in money matters
________________


Career Analysis
Direct Quote:
"The Sun and Neptune in Virgo in the 10th house. This is about being selective with his career, what he wants to do, and having services offered, which I know he does. Bringing the international house in higher education and learning all up in here. He definitely learned the things that he wanted to learn that would bring him money here with this trine here.
And a lot of investment in intangible things like medical stuff and whatnot. And also because of this, his company is basically a holdings company. And that is what this Neptune here is. It’s like his career isn’t really a career. It’s just trading money. That’s basically what he does."
Berkshire Hathaway Analysis:
                                    * Neptune in 10th: Career is “not really a career”—it’s a holdings company (Neptune = dissolution of typical career structure)
                                    * Virgo influence: Selective investments, service-oriented (Berkshire provides capital/services to companies)
                                    * “Trading money”: Not producing products, just moving capital
________________


Mutual Reception: 1st & 8th Houses
Direct Quote:
“And you can see that the eighth house rulers in the first house remember the ascendant in the first house are very important this has to do with international expanding higher education and knowledge that is in the investments house the investments ruler is back here so they are mutual in mutual reception here and this is why investments is his thing and that’s kind of what he’s done.”
Technical Note:
                                    * 8th house (investments, other people’s money) ruler is in 1st house (self, identity)
                                    * 1st house ruler is in 8th house
                                    * = Mutual reception (planets trade places by house rulership)
                                    * Result: Investments = identity, self = investments (perfectly aligned for investor career)
________________


Chiron in 6th House
Direct Quote:
"And there’s not a whole else to say other than Chiron in his sixth house, he can’t have a standard nine to five. If you have Chiron in your sixth house and you’re trying to work a nine to five, you’ll see that you run into a lot of issues because you’re just not designed to have, you know, that standard, you don’t have value in that routine.
So it’s got to be something, especially when it comes to money in the sixth house, Taurus in the sixth house, you know, doing it the same way every time is not how he does it. I know that often in the media, either he says it or other people say it for him, that he just has a strategy, but his strategy changes every single time. And he’s said that too."
Chiron in 6th House Principle:
                                    * Cannot do standard 9-to-5 work
                                    * Cannot have rigid routine
                                    * Must have flexibility in daily work structure
Buffett’s Strategy Myth:
                                    * Public perception: “Buffett has one strategy he follows”
                                    * Reality (per chart + his own statements): Strategy changes every time
                                    * Why: Taurus in 6th + Chiron = cannot value rigid repetition with money
________________


Venus in 11th House
Direct Quote:
"You see that, again, Capricorn is here. It’s in the same house, which means the second house ruler is in the second house. So money on money on money, banking, banking, finance, finance, value, arts, whatnot. And there is an art to what he does. So that’s there.
Venus is up here in the 11th house of community and tech and balancing out and all that kind of stuff."
Venus (universal money indicator) in 11th house:
                                    * Community investment
                                    * Technology (11th house)
                                    * Groups, networks
                                    * Balancing (Libra-ruled house in some systems)
Connection: Buffett invests in companies serving communities, technology advancement, etc.

C. STEVE JOBS: Aquarius Rising (Implied)
The Money Paradox
Direct Quote:
"Steve Jobs. This guy is interesting because what you know about him versus what he actually did oh my God, so different.
And I didn’t actually know this about him. I see it in his chart. I read his chart and then I had to go look it up because I was like, this dude made a ton of money. But in reality, he actually didn’t believe, and I said this with Neptune or Pisces in the second house these people don’t feel like they need money.
And they get their money through partnerships, and this would be loose partnerships, so nothing that is contractually obligated. But this is exactly how he made his money. This was actually his viewpoint on money is that he doesn’t need money, that it’s completely irrelevant and unnecessary, even though he ended up making like $250 million towards the end of his life. This was his relationship."
Critical Discovery:
 Jobs’ chart shows Pisces/Neptune in 2nd house = “money is unnecessary”
+
Reality: He genuinely believed this BUT still accumulated $250 million
+
Method: “Loose partnerships” (not formal contracts)
Research Confirmation:
 Instructor says “I had to go look it up” after reading chart—found Jobs’ actual stated philosophy matched the astrological indication perfectly.

Venus-Uranus Opposition: Tech for the Home
Direct Quote:
"The Venus placement, which rules this is over here in the fifth house of creativity in Capricorn creativity through structure or something of structure, because we’re talking about Venus, which is also items and the North node. This is something constantly achieving and constantly seeking but not not grasping at the beginning at the beginning it’s all this um cancer energy with both of this.
So this opposition between Venus, which is the ruler of a second house, and Uranus is the whole tech. This is actually how tech got in there. Computers for the home. This is exactly what he was trying to do with his philosophy here. With home computers."
Venus (Money Ruler) in 5th House in Capricorn:
                                    * Creativity through structure
                                    * Tangible creative items (Venus = physical objects)
                                    * North Node = life purpose constantly seeking
Uranus Opposition:
                                    * Venus opposite Uranus = structure (Venus/Capricorn) opposing tech/innovation (Uranus)
                                    * Resolution: Tech items FOR THE HOME (Cancer/home + Uranus/tech)
                                    * Result: Personal computers, not industrial computers
Original Vision:
Direct Quote:
“And his original idea was to sell it, you know, his first computer motherboard without any labeling on it, which is the Neptune, the dissolution of the actual value to it for $50, which is like 150 now or something like that. To computer people or whatever. I can’t remember who he was selling to, but that’s what his initial intention was.”
Neptune Influence:
                                    * “Dissolution of actual value” = selling bare motherboard for minimal profit
                                    * Original intention: serve computer hobbyists, not make massive money
                                    * Pricing: $50 (equivalent ~$150 later) = not profit-maximizing
________________


Chart Ruler in Aquarius: Future Orientation
Direct Quote:
"But if you notice that his chart ruler is over here in Aquarius about the future and Chiron. Embracing the fact that the future and using things on a daily basis, especially technology here, this is the other way the tech comes in.
Chiron is like the inability to figure out what that is and how to use that on a daily basis and whatnot. And they use this Mercury retrograde to think outside of the box here."
Chiron in 6th House + Aquarius:
                                    * Difficulty with standard daily work (like Buffett)
                                    * Technology in daily life (Aquarius/future)
                                    * Mercury retrograde = thinking outside the box
________________


Saturn in Scorpio: Secrecy
Direct Quote:
"But when you tie all this in together, you’ll notice that his Saturn is in, which rules the career, is in Scorpio. Its ruler is in Leo and the 12th house.
You’ll notice that his money ruler is in the fifth house. So when you start pulling all this together, here and there his own corporation is Pisces ruled with the sun his way forward was actually not like it was, it was future oriented and future thinking, but he was never really the cutting edge of many things. He reinvented things and then other companies got on and kind of surpassed and he kind of catch up and do something else."
Career Strategy:
                                    * Saturn in Scorpio = secrecy in career approach
                                    * Ruler (Pluto) in Leo in 12th = hidden creative authority
                                    * Not actually cutting edge (contrary to public perception)
                                    * Actually: Reinvented existing things, others surpassed, he caught up
Pattern:
                                    1. Jobs reinvents existing tech
                                    2. Competitors catch up/surpass
                                    3. Jobs reinvents again
                                    4. Cycle repeats

Moon in Aries & Mars in Aries: Pioneering with Secrets
Direct Quote:
"He was definitely a pioneer in what he did. He has that moon in Aries, that Mars in Aries energy with the eighth, a lot of secrets and things like that. But he was definitely on the cutting edge and that kind of went into the ninth house into Taurus. And that’s how he made his value, his money by not telling everybody what he was doing and then coming out with it.
A lot of secrecy and you’ve seen that where his events and things like that."
Secrecy Strategy:
                                    * 8th house emphasis = secrets
                                    * Development in secret → big reveal events
                                    * Created hype through withholding information
                                    * Famous product launches with surprise elements

The Creative-Media Truth
Direct Quote:
"But what I found the most interesting is that all these creative placements are not about his success in the actual tech sphere in terms of tech being tech. It is always taking creative and like creative expression and music and entertainment and things like that.
And I find that interesting because if you look at the Apple computers as they came out, what really made them appealing was two main things. Three main things. One of them is that they couldn’t really get viruses. The second one, and they were not PCs. The second thing was they came in all sorts of colors. And the third thing was he was the first, the Apple computer was the first one to be loaded with a game."
What Actually Made Apple Successful (Per Chart):
NOT:
                                    * Superior technology
                                    * Cutting-edge innovation
                                    * Better specs
YES:
                                    1. Colors (creative/aesthetic choice)
                                    2. Games included (entertainment)
                                    3. Virus resistance (security, but secondary)
Creative/Media Evidence:
Direct Quote:
"And I find that interesting because in his chart, it’s all about creativity and creative expression and entertainment and things of that nature. Obviously, Apple has Apple TV and jumped on with everything else. But this is more about him when he was there.
And the whole thing with like entertainment and movies and music, he focused so much on that iPhone being able to take pictures, have good quality. Apple’s Codex, if you know anything about Apple computers with ProRes and all of that, ended up doing the… The final cut, as obviously Apple dropped it, but he was one of the first ones to give a professional product for film editing to consumers.
And then, of course, the iPhone also, or the iPad, what the hell are they called? iPod, the iPod originally an Apple brand of his creation, being about music. And that’s literally what all of this is saying here."
Apple Products as Creative/Media Tools:
                                    * Colorful iMacs: Aesthetic/creative appeal
                                    * iPhone cameras: Photography/creativity focus
                                    * Final Cut Pro: Professional film editing for consumers
                                    * iPod: “All about music”
                                    * ProRes codec: Video production
                                    * Apple TV: Entertainment

Not Tech, But Creative Person in Tech
Direct Quote:
"When you put it all together, that his career was idea generating by taking things that already existed, transforming them and creating it in a new fashion.
And that’s why all the emphasis is not actually on him being in tech, but him being a creative person, revolutionizing things that have to do with media and creativity.
So all those colorful computers, all of that music in the iPod, all the cameras on the phones, like the first iPhone could not send picture messaging, but it took a good picture. So, you know, for the time.
So it was very interesting that it wasn’t like ahead of the curve on everything as much as it was just trying to one up the things that, you know, he did focus on, which were multimedia based."
Final Analysis:
                                    * Public perception: Tech genius
                                    * Chart reality: Creative person revolutionizing media/entertainment tools
                                    * Strategy: Not ahead on ALL tech, but focused on multimedia aspects
                                    * Example: First iPhone couldn’t send MMS, but camera quality was priority
Midheaven in Gemini:
Direct Quote:
“Midheaven in Gemini was like multiple things going at the same time as well.”
                                    * Multiple product lines simultaneously
                                    * Computers + phones + music players + tablets + software
                                    * Duality/multiplicity in career
________________


XIII. FINAL SYNTHESIS & CLOSING REMARKS
Direct Quote:
"So this is all about how to look at money, your connection, your relationship with money, how you can start making money by realizing the cycles of how money has or has not come about in your life.
You’ll be able to take transits in the near future and apply that, progressions as well and relocations. But this is supposed to be a basic introduction so you understand how money plays out in astrology. True astrology.
And then you can transmute these real universal energies so that you can live the best life that you want to live, vibe higher, and just be happier than everybody else who doesn’t have the cheat code of astrology."

                                    * ONLY natal chart money analysis
                                    * NOT covered yet: Transits, progressions, relocations (separate future classes)
                                    * This is “basic introduction” to money astrology
2. Application Process:
                                    * Understand natal money configuration
                                    * Recognize historical money cycles
                                    * THEN apply transits/progressions (future learning)
3. TRUE Astrology Philosophy:
                                    * Transmuting Real Universal Energies
                                    * Not fatalistic—energy is malleable
                                    * Can “vibe higher” by conscious use of chart knowledge
                                    * Astrology as “cheat code” for life optimization
4. Next Class Indicators:
                                    * Progressions class will expand on WHEN money comes (timing)
                                    * Astrocartography (relocations) affects Midheaven and thus career/money
                                    * Transits class will show temporary money windows

TRANSCRIPT 8: UBER NEWBIE BASICS WEBINAR
Complete Harvard-Level Extraction
Alchemystic Astrology Introduction Class
________________


I. INTRODUCTION & CONTEXT
A. Welcome & Purpose
Direct Quote:
“Hey everybody, welcome to the Uber Newbie Basics. Basically, it’s a tutorial and a walkthrough of everything you need to know to get into astrology, especially alchemistic astrology, because we view astrology differently than other systems.”
Class Positioning:
 This is explicitly framed as “the class before the class”—a prerequisite introduction designed to prevent newcomers from feeling “completely lost” when jumping into the main curriculum.
________________


B. The Martial Arts School Analogy
Direct Quote:
“When you join a martial arts school, usually, at least in my school, before you get your white belt, before you take that first class, there’s an intro class. It’s kind of like where we, the instructor, take you ahead of time onto the mat. We show you the flags. We show you the mat. We show you the mirrors. We show you your space. We teach you how to bow, to enter, ready position, all of that. And we basically get you clued in so that, as you jump into class, you don’t feel completely lost.”
Purpose of Analogy:
 Establishes this webinar as foundational orientation—not substantive training but essential prep work so students can engage with actual courses effectively.
________________


C. Mystic Circle Context
Direct Quote:
“Now, we are doing this— not kind of, in four days, it’ll be the one-year anniversary of Mystic Circle, which is an exciting time for us. All of our classes, all of our replays, all of our information, it’s all good stuff. But if you’re brand new to astrology and— A lot of people are— We can’t do courses where we’re teaching people or talking to people as if they know all this stuff because they don’t.”
Problem Statement:
 Students joining the established Mystic Circle community mid-stream lack foundational vocabulary and concepts. “It’s very easy to get lost in the sauce and try to learn all this when you don’t have the very, very basic, basic, basics down.”
________________


D. Target Audience
Direct Quote:
“If you already know how to read a glyph, you already know that alchemistic astrology is all about energy, you already know these things, then this isn’t necessarily for you. But if you’re getting in and you’ve either come from a different system of astrology or you’re trying to unlearn to learn or this is brand new to you to begin with, this is going to be great for you.”
Three Audience Segments:
                                                                                                            1. Brand new to astrology (complete beginners)
                                                                                                            2. Coming from different systems (need paradigm shift)
                                                                                                            3. “Unlearning to relearn” (deprogramming from traditional astrology)

II. CORE PHILOSOPHY: ENERGY AS FOUNDATION
A. Energy, Not Placements
Direct Quote:
“First thing that you need to know is energy. Everything in alchemistic astrology is energy. We do not look at placements in a chart and say, ‘Oh, this planet is sitting in this house or this planet is sitting in this sign. Therefore, it means XYZ.’ We don’t do that. You should not be doing that because that’s not what you’re actually looking at.”
PDF Slide 2 - Energy Definition:
"In Alchemystic Astrology, you are not reading zodiac signs or planets. You’re not memorizing definitions or analyzing placements.
You’re working with energy—just like light, color, and sound. Everything is frequency. None of it acts alone—it must be read together in the context of the entire chart. Energies are not static, nor are they fixed. They bend and meld. They pulsate and permeate. Energy is the ability to do work.
Unlike other systems, it’s not: ‘what does it mean?’ For us, it’s ‘how does it manifest?’
Why? Because we alchemize."
Critical Distinction:
                                                                                                            * Traditional Astrology: “Mars in 7th house = this definition”
                                                                                                            * Alchemystic Astrology: “Mars energy expresses through this field, in this tone, governed by this ruler—how does THIS manifest?”
________________


B. The Musical Instrument Analogy
Direct Quote:
"It’s kind of like if I… go ‘dong.’ Well, the actual striking of the instrument, the instrument is what creates the reverberation and the frequency, the shape of it, the material of it, so on and so forth. But the lingering ‘dong’ that happens, that is not the planet itself. That is not a thing. That is a frequency. That is a sound. That is an energy that comes out and it permeates until it fades. It has a gradient roll-off, if you will.
That’s the same thing with when you’re talking about planets."
Application:
                                                                                                            * Planet = Instrument being struck
                                                                                                            * Energy/Frequency = The sound that reverberates
                                                                                                            * What affects you = The frequency, not the physical planet

                                                                                                            4. You, as extension of Earth, experience that energy
Where Is Earth in the Chart?
Direct Quote:
“A lot of people will ask me, where’s the earth in a natal chart? I’m going to show you that, but it’s everywhere. It’s everything. The earth is you. You are the earth. You are an extension of the earth, and that’s where your energies come from.”
________________


D. How Does It Manifest? (Not What Does It Mean?)
Direct Quote:
"In alchemistic astrology, you’re not reading those zodiac signs or planets. You’re not memorizing definitions or analyzing placements. Again, you’re not looking at the moon in the ninth house, ‘What does it mean?’ You’re looking at the moon and saying, ‘These are the themes in my life. How are they expressed?’
And because you’re working with energy like light, color, and sound, everything is frequency. None of it acts alone. They all blend and meld. Energy, by definition, is the ability to do work."
Operational Question:
 Not “What does Mars in Scorpio mean?” but “How does action/assertion energy manifest through depth/intensity/transformation?”
________________


III. ALCHEMY + MYSTIC = ALCHEMYSTIC
A. Etymology & Definition
PDF Slide 3:
"The name of the system is Alchemystic Astrology. That’s Alchemy + Mystic.
Alchemy: A seemingly magical process of transformation, creation, or combination. In Alchemystic Astrology, alchemy is the practice of using energetic awareness to shift, harmonize, or redirect energy within your chart or transit experience to manifest favorable outcomes.
You are not a prisoner to your chart; the Universe does not dictate your life. You have Free Will."
Instructor Elaboration:
“Alchemistic is alchemy plus mysticism, as in mystic rebels. That’s why it’s called alchemistic.”
________________


B. Alchemy in Practice
Direct Quote:
"If you’re looking at definitions, you can’t alchemize a definition. You have to be working with energy to understand what alchemy is.
A lot of systems of astrology are fatalistic. They are deterministic. They basically say you have fate, you have destiny, you have karma. You have all of this that says, ‘Boop. This is what’s going to happen. Tough noogies.’
In alchemical astrology, we say this is what’s likely to happen. If you don’t want that to happen, let’s talk about it."
Example of Transmutation:
"‘Oh, I want Mars to act like this. Not different than Mars, but Mars has a whole spectrum of the ways that it can play out.’ You say, ‘I don’t want Mars to be aggression. I want Mars to be something blunt. I want Mars to be assertive. I don’t want Mars to come off too direct. I want Mars to come off in an actionable way.’
You can turn that around. So it’s not about aggression. It’s just about action. You’re still using Mars. You’re just changing how it’s being used."
________________


###C. Free Will is Central
Direct Quote:
“You are not a prisoner to your chart. The universe does not dictate your life. You have free will. Free will is extremely important in this system.”
Philosophical Stance:
 Chart shows energetic potentials and likely manifestations, NOT fixed fate. Conscious awareness allows transmutation from lower to higher vibrational expressions of same energy.
________________


D. Alchemy vs. Manifesting
Direct Quote:
“Alchemy doesn’t mean manifesting. Alchemy is the tool you’re going to use to manifest. Manifesting is this entire thing that includes intention, action, and alignment.”
Clarification:
                                                                                                            * Alchemy = The technique of energy transmutation
                                                                                                            * Manifesting = The complete process (intention + action + alignment)
                                                                                                            * Alchemy is within manifesting but not synonymous
________________


E. Astronomy-Based Accuracy
Direct Quote:
“Alchemistic astrology uses astronomy. It is one of the only systems of astrology that actually cares about the actual astronomy. This is why it’s so accurate.”
Distinguishing Factor:
 Most astrology systems ignore actual astronomical mechanics. Alchemystic astrology grounds interpretations in real celestial mechanics, orbital patterns, and spatial relationships.

IV. THE NATAL CHART STRUCTURE
A. The Snapshot
Direct Quote:
“A natal chart, or any chart, is a snapshot of the sky. Everything—not just the sun, not just the moon, not just the ascendant—everything comprises your chart.”
PDF Slide 4:
“A [natal] chart is a snapshot of the sky the exact time and place you were born. Those energies imprint and become you. At the basic level, you will see this 360º model (the Universe all around you) shown with Planets, Signs, and Houses.”
________________


B. You ARE the Amalgam
Direct Quote:
“Everything about the energetic imprint becomes you. It is you. Not one thing. You’re not your sun sign. You’re not any sign. You are an amalgam of everything that is in your chart.”
Anti-Pattern:
 Rejecting “I’m a Scorpio” reductionism. The entire chart = you.
________________


V. THE TEN PLANETS + EARTH
A. Grand Design Order
PDF Slide 5:
"There are ten of them. One is technically a star (the Sun). One is a satellite (the Moon). For our purposes, we refer to them all as planets.
There is a specific order that you should memorize—this is the Grand Design of the solar system. We use this in our understanding when determining how energy works on an astronomical level."
The Order:
 Sun → Mercury → Venus → (Earth) → Moon → Mars → Jupiter → Saturn → Uranus → Neptune → Pluto
Instructor Note:
“The order of planets matters, and you’re going to see that when I get to the next parts in the next sections.”
________________


B. Astronomical Doctrine of Signatures
Direct Quote:
“The reason why this matters, astronomically speaking, is Mercury comes first from the Sun. That tells you, through what’s called the Astronomical Doctrine of Signatures, its traits, its velocity, its speed, its proximity, its size, its atmosphere, all of that stuff goes into its interpretation of its energetic frequency. Why it is the way it is and why it can’t be something else.”
Principle:
 A planet’s physical characteristics (size, distance from sun, orbital speed, composition, atmosphere, rings, moons, etc.) directly inform its energetic signature.
Examples:
                                                                                                            * Mercury: Closest to Sun, fastest orbit → mental quickness, communication
                                                                                                            * Saturn: Rings, slow orbit → structure, boundaries, time
                                                                                                            * Pluto: Binary system with Charon → intimacy, bonds, shared resources
Direct Quote:
“Pluto is a binary system. It is one planet, but it’s technically two. It, with its moon, creates a binary system, which is why it has to do with intimacy and bonds.”
________________


C. Planetary Glyphs - Must Memorize
Direct Quote:
"Each planet’s going to have a symbol, an icon, or a glyph. Doesn’t matter which word you use, it’s the same thing. It’s that thing on the natal chart that you’re going to be like, ‘What is that?’ ‘What is that?’ And at first, it’s all going to look Greek to you. And if you do speak Greek, it’s going to look Japanese to you.
You need to remember these. There’s not a lot that you have to remember. You have to understand the core. You have to understand the basics. And the glyphs are something you have to memorize so that you can identify them."

D. The Five-Tier Planetary Classification System
This is the unique framework of Alchemystic Astrology that differs from all other systems.
________________


TIER 1: ULTRAPERSONAL PLANETS (Sun & Moon)
Direct Quote:
“These are the first two planets you need to know about, and I’m grouping them intentionally because these are called ultra-personal planets. These are the ones that are going to be the most personal to you and the closest to heart.”
The “Big Three” Clarification:
“Now, when you hear about the Ascendant, the Sun, and the Moon, and they call it your big three, the big three concept is terrible. However, the Ascendant, the Sun, and the Moon are the most important. You do have to know these. You have to know why.”
Why They’re Most Important:
“They are not everything. They don’t take over everything else, but they’re going to be the things that you make the most decisions in life based off of. They have to do with your sense of happiness and purpose and your sense of emotional security, safety, and needs.”
Energy Multiplier Principle:
“Your greatest achievements are all going to come from understanding your sun placement and the other energies. Now, we aren’t going to get into related energies, but just know that the sun shows up—the sun glyph shows up once in your chart, but the sun’s energy shows up four times in your chart. Your Leo house, your fifth house, your sun in terms of the house it’s in, and then the sun in terms of the sign that it’s in. Those are four times that it’s going to show up. Same thing with the moon. Same thing with Venus, which is actually a little bit more. Same thing with Mars.”
Glyph Origins (PDF Slide 6):
☉ SUN:
                                                                                                            * Origin: Greek and Egyptian solar symbolism
                                                                                                            * “The circle with a dot represents the solar disk (Ra or Helios) and the central point of divine consciousness. Used in ancient Egyptian cosmology as the Sun God’s eye.”
☽ MOON:
                                                                                                            * Origin: Lunar phases
                                                                                                            * “The crescent shape directly mimics the visible crescent Moon. Appears in Babylonian and Greek calendars to mark lunar time.”
________________


TIER 2: PERSONAL PLANETS - INTRA/INTERPERSONAL (Mercury & Venus)
The Ecliptic Principle:
Direct Quote:
"Mercury and Venus have a very special place in the chart because of their position in the solar system. When we looked up here, we saw the sun and we have the earth. Between the sun and the earth is something called the ecliptic.
The ecliptic is an imaginary tether that says, ‘Here’s the sun and the thing that gives us life, the thing that we orbit around. Here’s the earth, the planet of existence and reality that we sit on. And these two are anchored.’ Everything in astrology is based on the ecliptic. It’s extremely important to learn that word."
Inferior vs. Superior Positions:
Direct Quote:
"The only two planets that sit between it are Mercury and Venus. This is why they’re inter-and intrapersonal. However, Mercury can also be on the other side of the Sun. Venus can be on the other side of the Sun because they orbit the Sun as well. You can have Earth over here and Mercury or Venus over here, and that creates a difference.
So when we get to them, we see two positions. We see inferior positions, which is when they are between the Earth and the Sun. And then we see superior, which is when it’s on the other side. You look at it as the Sun is between those planets and Earth."
Inferior = Intrapersonal (Inward):
                                                                                                            * Mercury Inferior: Gemini (mind within self)
                                                                                                            * Venus Inferior: Taurus (self-value)
Superior = Interpersonal (Outward):
                                                                                                            * Mercury Superior: Virgo (mind in relation to world/others)
                                                                                                            * Venus Superior: Libra (value in relationships/with others)
Direct Quote:
"Mercury rules Gemini. It also rules Virgo. You have Venus that rules Taurus and also rules Libra. So Taurus is the inward version, it’s the inferior position. Libra is the external, it is the superior position. With Mercury, Gemini is the interior or the inferior position inward. And then Virgo is the outward, is how you relate to other people in the world.
It still has to do with the same keywords. Mercury means the mind. It means mental faculty, basically. And it means mental faculty when it’s Gemini, and it means it when it’s Virgo. Venus rules value. When it is Taurus, it is self-value. When it is Venus [Libra], it is outward value or value in relation to others.
So both of those retain certain themes and keywords, but it’s whether or not that’s inward or outward."

☿ MERCURY:
                                                                                                            * Origin: Hermes’ caduceus
                                                                                                            * “Combines: circle (spirit), cross (matter/body), pair of horns or wings (Hermes’ winged helmet or caduceus). Rooted in Hermetic and alchemical texts, Mercury being the messenger and symbol of duality and motion.”
♀ VENUS:
                                                                                                            * Origin: Hand mirror of Aphrodite
                                                                                                            * “Depicts a mirror—associated with beauty and reflection. Ancient Roman representation of Venus/Aphrodite’s femininity and form.”
________________


TIER 3: EXTRAPERSONAL PLANET - THE CONNECTOR (Mars)
Revolutionary Classification:
Direct Quote:
"Now, this is a tricky one because Mars is considered a personal planet in literally every system of astrology except alchemistic. And that is because, again, I use the astronomy and I have documented how these planets actually play a role.
Mars is not a personal planet; it does not ever sit between the Earth and the Sun at any point in its orbit. It will never be personal. So it is actually a connector and an extra personal planet. It is what connects the Earth, you, reality to the outside world."
Mars = Physical Body:
Direct Quote:
“Mars rules the physical body. Is that your soul? Is that you? No. It’s that outer layer that enables you to do things in the world. Without your body, you would just be a floating set of energy that couldn’t connect. The body gives you that ability. It is the action. It is the go.”
Why Not Personal:
 Never sits between Earth-Sun axis → Cannot be “personal”
Always outside Earth’s orbit → Connector to external world
PDF Slide 8 - Glyph:
♂ MARS:
                                                                                                            * Origin: Spear and shield of Ares
                                                                                                            * “Circle = shield, Arrow = spear. Roman and Greek depictions of Mars/Ares as the god of war used this to show masculine strength and outward action.”
War Clarification:
“It doesn’t really represent war. War is a complicated word. Scorpio is very much needed for war. You need that conflict. You need that brewing. That leads in, but there is a quincunx—you’ll learn about these later—from Scorpio to Aries. Aries is the action of war. It is all this stuff that festered is now coming out in competition, aggression, and assertion.”
________________


TIER 4: TRANSPERSONAL PLANETS (Jupiter & Saturn)
Direct Quote:
“Next, we have our transpersonal planets. This is where society, the world, the general public, this is the next stage in energetic frequency happens with Jupiter, which was based on Zeus, and then Saturn, which is based on Kronos.”
PDF Slide 9 - Glyphs:
♃ JUPITER:
                                                                                                            * Origin: Zeta or abbreviation of Zeus
                                                                                                            * “Possibly a stylized ‘Z’ for Zeus or Greek letter zeta (ζ). Sometimes interpreted as an eagle’s beak or lightning bolt, Zeus’ weapon.”
♄ SATURN:
                                                                                                            * Origin: Sickle of Kronos
                                                                                                            * “Cross over a curved shape represents the sickle or scythe used by Saturn/Kronos to harvest or cut time. Seen in Roman mythology and agrarian symbolism.”
Function:
 Beyond personal action (Mars), these planets govern interface with society, public world, collective structures.
________________


TIER 5: METAPERSONAL PLANETS (Uranus, Neptune, Pluto)
Rejecting “Generational” Label:
Direct Quote:
“When you get beyond the public, then you’re hitting the meta-personal planets. Meta-personal planets is not generational. I’ve always, from day one, I’ve always hated the term generational planets. They say Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto are generational. I understand why they say it. It’s because it literally can cross generations. But when you hear ‘generational,’ you think, ‘Pluto for me was here. Pluto for my kids is here.’ And you think that the generations are marked by these planets. They are not.”
What Actually Creates Ages/Epochs:
“There’s something separate called astrological epochs. And that is the sidereally based incremental time splices, so to speak. When there’s an era, when there’s an age, when there are phases, when there’s certain time frames where something happens, that is not based on Uranus, it is not based on Neptune, it is not based on Pluto. It’s actually based on the planet itself in its own cycles. Because the axial tilt, the axis itself, where we rotate upon, wobbles. And that creates your astrological ages and such.”
Metapersonal Definition:
“So these are meta-personal planets. What they are is they set the stage beyond. So it’s not about the world. It’s what’s beyond the world. So, for instance, Uranus is not about time. It’s what’s beyond time. Neptune is not about reality. It’s what’s beyond reality. Pluto is not about value. It’s what’s beyond value or immersing yourself into depths of value. It’s anything that is not in the static, in the now. These are your metapersonal planets.”
Every Planet is Personal:
Direct Quote:
"You have your ultrapersonal. You have your personal, which includes intra and interpersonal. You have your extra-personal planet, you have your transpersonal planets, and you have your meta-personal planets. So they’re all personal. Do you see that? All personal. They all connect to you.
So when we call them generational planets, the other problem is that you are not connecting it to yourself. You assume that Pluto is only other people, when in reality it’s connecting you to others, connecting you to others’ resources, connecting you to trauma. You are still a part of it. Every planet is personal."

Meaning: Spirit (divine will) rising above the subconscious (crescent), which in turn sits above the physical/material world (cross). Alternate version (♇): Combines P & L, as Percival Lowell’s initials (who theorized its existence), or an abbreviation for Pluto itself.”

VI. THE TWELVE ZODIAC SIGNS
A. Grand Design, Not Archetypes
Direct Quote:
“Zodiac signs. This is where everybody gets hung up. Everybody thinks that all astrology is zodiac signs. They’re very important. They are the foundational base of astrology. The 12, they call them archetypes, but they are not. They’re just 12 ordered energies of grand design.”
The Eternal Order:
"**The zodiac signs are based off of these 10 planets. Mercury and Venus rule two because they can be inward and they can be outward, and they position themselves in a 360-degree wheel around us… **
This order will always be the order: Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius, Pisces, and back.**
Unless you’re talking about astrological ages, which go backwards, you’ll read that in my book."

B. Modality - Secondary Descriptor, Not Primary
Direct Quote:
"When we get to zodiac signs, instead of putting them in order, you see them in order in your chart, I’ve grouped them by modality. Modality is not the primary influence. Some people say all fixed signs, all cardinal signs, all mutable signs. Yes, those are the three—cardinal, fixed, mutable. And in a future class, I’m going to break down what cardinal means, fixed means, mutable means.
It does not mean that they’re connected and they’re together. It doesn’t mean that you’re supposed to look at a mutable sign as something that can’t be stagnant. Mutable signs can be stagnant. Even though mutable means change, you can get stuck. A fixed sign is not always about what stays. It’s about what is sustainable. A cardinal sign is not always about what begins, although we represent the initiators. It is about what we’re setting in motion."
Key Insight:
 Modality is functional descriptor, not identity. Don’t group signs by modality and assume they operate the same way.

C. Cardinal Signs - The Initiators (Aries, Cancer, Libra, Capricorn)
Astronomical Basis:
Direct Quote:
"These represent the solstices and the equinoxes. Aries is the sign that when the sun… Because of the axial tilt of the Earth, and the Earth goes like this around the Sun, the Sun, in an illusion, goes up and down in the sky.
At zero degrees, when it’s completely even, at the median point, or the middle ground, going north is Aries. When it hits the top, it’s Cancer. When it comes back and hits the middle, it’s Libra. When it hits the bottom, it’s Capricorn. When it comes back, it’s Aries again. Those are how we mark the changes."
What You’re Crossing:
“You’re crossing barriers. You’re crossing markers. You’re crossing the zero degree. You’re crossing the height, which is 23.44 degrees. Middle again, bottom 23.44 degrees.”
________________


♈ ARIES (PDF Slide 11)
Glyph Origin:
 “Origin: Ram’s horns (ancient symbol of spring and initiation). Represents boldness, ignition, instinct. Stylized ram horns show direct, forward energy.”
Instructor Commentary:
“Now, Aries looks like this because it’s the ram. It’s stylized ram horns. It’s talking about forward, concentrated, directed energy. That is why it’s not the face of a ram. It is a V shape. It points at the bottom because it emulates Aries energy with the arrow.”
________________


♋ CANCER (PDF Slide 11)
Glyph Origin:
 “Origin: Crab claws or lunar breast curves. Symbol of protection, motherhood, and cyclical emotion. The curved shapes mimic holding, nurturing, or tides.”
Instructor Commentary:
“When you get to Cancer, a lot of people don’t realize that these are boobies. Everyone thinks that they’re just crab claws. They’re actually boobies because Cancer has to do with nurturing and motherhood. It can be the claws as well. It kind of envelops both. But like Sharon said in all caps, boobies.”
Duality Note:
“I want to point out every one of these zodiac glyphs that has two lines or two sections that are separated, every one of them has a duality. I always hear people say duality is Gemini. And yes, Gemini has to do with a literally two-duality. It is not the only one.”
Cancer & Libra Both Have Separated Duality:
“In this PDF slide alone, Cancer and Libra both have a separated and nuanced duality to them. This is something that we’ll discuss further in Mystic Circle in future classes, but realize that Gemini is not the only one that has a dual nature to it.”
________________


♎ LIBRA (PDF Slide 11)
Glyph Origin:
 “Origin: Balance scales or equinox horizon. Represents fairness, judgment, and harmony. Straight line + curve = measured balance, symmetry.”
Instructor Commentary:
"Libra. A lot of people say it’s the scales, and yes, it is the scales. However, what it really is is the horizon line. Libra is sunset.
In alchemistic astrology, when you read my book, this is all going to make sense. But there is sunrise and there is sunset. Sunrise sits here with Aries. Sunset sits with Libra. Sunset is arguably more important than sunrise in astrology because what it does is it’s a point that says, ‘This is what’s public, this is what’s personal, this is the transition of where things public come back to me.’"
The Descendant Function:
"It transitions back into my personal life. Your descendant is a point that we’ll talk about in a minute, sits in that seventh house, sits in that Libra energy. And it is a point that you have to realize that the people that you connect with and the people that you attract are going to come in and fuck up your sense of emotional security in your foundations because you are bringing that in.
This is why it’s very important to protect yourself because that sun-setted energy is no longer public, it’s private. So whatever you’re connecting to on that level is coming back inward."
________________


♑ CAPRICORN (PDF Slide 11)
Glyph Origin:
 “Origin: Sea-goat (Babylonian god Enki’s hybrid creature). Mastery through endurance, climb from depth to height. Goat horn + fish tail = spiritual/earthly integration.”
Water-Earth Paradox:
Direct Quote:
"Then we have Capricorn, which is the sea goat. It is a Babylonian god, a hybrid creature… What’s interesting is Capricorn and sea, Capricorn and water. It is an earth element. I didn’t put the elements on here intentionally, but we have fire, water, air, earth. You have to know that, yes, Capricorn is an earth energy. But it is a water-based earth energy.
Why? It sextiles back to Scorpio. It sextiles forward back to Pisces. It represents ice. Like the planet that rules it is Saturn. What is Saturn made of? What are the rings made of? Water, ice."
Element Caution:
“So understanding that… You can’t look at modality, which is cardinal in this case, and say, ‘Oh, it’s only about starting.’ You can’t look at element and say it’s only Earth stuff. Earth is a very loose term. It doesn’t actually mean rock, although Capricorn does rule rock. It has to do with structure, which we contribute or attribute to earthly things. Even though it’s earth, it rules water when it’s hardened, right? So this is why we have to be very careful how we learn this and why a lot of people unlearn to relearn here.”
Cardinal Energy Clarification:
“Fixed energies. These are the sustainers. Something that’s already started, brought anew, initiated. This is where we sustain it. Sustenance and sustaining is another thing. Sustaining something literally is a Capricorn trait, but it’s a cardinal energy. The reason why it’s a cardinal energy is because we are changing directions. We are not preparing ourselves for the change that’s mutable. We are changing directions. It is a pivot point. That’s one thing that’s not talked about in Cardinal. The reason it’s a start is because it’s a pivot.”
Capricorn & Past:
“Saturn and Capricorn represent the past because of where it sits. It’s at the bottom of the sun’s declination. That’s also why it’s sustaining. You’re taking something that already is and pulling it until you end up hitting Aquarius energy, which is next, which is saying, ‘This is what we have. How do we move this forward?’”

D. Fixed Signs - The Sustainers (Taurus, Leo, Scorpio, Aquarius)
PDF Slide 12 Header:
 “These will be your Fixed Energies, representing the sustainers.”
________________


♉ TAURUS (PDF Slide 12)
Glyph Origin:
 “Origin: Bull’s head with horns (Mesopotamian sacred bull). Symbol of value, endurance, and embodiment. Circle with crescent horns = form + strength.”
Instructor Commentary:
“The Taurus glyph is pretty obvious. It is the bull’s head with the horns. And the circle also represents life. Whenever you see a circle in a zodiac glyph, there’s an element of life or vitality, Leo included.”
________________


♌ LEO (PDF Slide 12)
Glyph Origin:
 “Origin: Lion’s mane and tail. Sign of leadership, radiance, expressive power. Curling glyph mimics solar flare or lion’s body motion.”
Instructor Note:
“Leo is the fixed fire sign. It is the lion’s mane and tail, but this is also life [the circle].”
________________


♏ SCORPIO (PDF Slide 12)
Glyph Origin:
 “Origin: ‘M’ for maiden with outward stinger. Depth, protection, transformation. Tail points outward = readiness to strike or protect (scorpion).”
Instructor Commentary:
"Scorpio, this one’s an interesting one because when you get to Virgo later, the M is for maiden. That is why it’s an M. Now, Scorpio represents a couple of things. One, yes, it’s still based off of the maiden. It sextiles back to Virgo, which means there’s an inclusion.
But that M is also the back of a scorpion, and it has the Scorpio’s tail, the stinger. And it has to do with protection and transformation. Protection is coming from the trine from Cancer. The tail points outward. It’s a readiness to strike, which is why it feeds directly into Aries. It’s a readiness to strike. It does not strike. Scorpio doesn’t strike. Aries strikes."
________________


♒ AQUARIUS (PDF Slide 12)
Glyph Origin:
 “Origin: Water-bearer’s waves (energy or knowledge flow). Symbol of frequency, broadcasting, revolution. Double zigzags = continuous streams of transmission.”
Instructor Commentary:
“Aquarius is the water bearer, another one that has to do with water, the waves, the energy, knowledge flow, things of that nature. Again, there’s a duality to Aquarius. Double zigzags, streams, transmission, all of that.”
________________


E. Mutable Signs - The Adapters (Gemini, Virgo, Sagittarius, Pisces)
PDF Slide 13 Header:
 “These will be your Mutable Energies, representing the adapters.”
Instructor Commentary:
“When we get to the mutable energies, these are the adapters. These are the ones trying to find their way, see what needs to change. How do we flow with it? How do we take what we’re sustaining and say, ‘Oh, we got to manipulate, move, course correct.’ These are the energies that do that.”
________________


♊ GEMINI (PDF Slide 13)
Glyph Origin:
 “Origin: Roman numeral II (the twins Castor & Pollux). Duality, mirroring, mental agility. Represents interaction between two poles of thought.”
Instructor Commentary:
"Like I said before, Gemini is the Roman numeral two. It represents the twins Castor and Pollux, which are stars that are in that zodiac constellation. But it is not disconnected. They work together.
So your duality in Gemini is not two different things. It’s two things you can do that connect together. It’s why it’s options. Gemini rules options because you’re not saying, ‘I could do this’ or ‘I could do that’ and they’re completely unrelated. It’s like I’m going to the restaurant. I can go get Chinese. I can go get Mediterranean. I’m still looking for food. These are just options within the same paradigm. Gemini is a connected duality.
And this is, again, why it’s so misinterpreted in other systems as they just say, ‘Oh, it’s two different things.’ Eh, not usually. It is not usually two different things. It’s two options within the same thing. So of the duality, it’s the least dual."
________________


♍ VIRGO (PDF Slide 13)
Glyph Origin:
 “Origin: ‘M’ for maiden with inward tail (modesty or crossed legs). Service, refinement, systems of purity. Tail curling inward = the harvest, discernment, and purity.”
Instructor Commentary:
“Virgo, there’s the M, and its tail comes back in, does not have a stinger, comes back in, wraps in. The legs are closed. She’s a prude. This is the maiden. Modesty also signifies the harvest, so holding the wheat.”
________________


♐ SAGITTARIUS (PDF Slide 13)
Glyph Origin:
 “Origin: Arrow of the centaur (archer aiming skyward). Vision, truth-seeking, momentum. Diagonal arrow = pursuit of something higher.”
Instructor Commentary:
“When we get into Sagittarius, this one’s pretty obvious. It’s the arrow of the centaur. It is aiming up. We’re looking for a heightened visibility. We’re looking to go outward. We’re rising. It’s about vision, truth-seeking, looking for something bigger, better, higher. It is not better. We haven’t achieved it. We’re looking for it. That’s why it’s search. It’s seek. We’re aiming.”
________________


♓ PISCES (PDF Slide 13)
Glyph Origin:
 “Origin: Two fish swimming in opposite directions, tied by a cord. Surrender, dualism, transcendence. Curves with a bridge = linked inner and outer realms.”
Instructor Commentary:
“Pisces, this one is two fish swimming in two different oppositions, and they are tethered by a cord. So this one is another duality that is trying to pull against itself but is stuck. This is about surrendering. This is about you can’t fight your other half. You can’t fight your duality. They are stuck together. You’re going to have to learn how to integrate them. Curves with a bridge, inner and outer realms, transcendence, dualism, all of that is together. That is what Pisces represents.”

“These are why these zodiac glyphs were created and what they mean. Study this. Know how to see it in a chart so that you can easily identify it.”

VII. THE DUAL WHEEL NATAL CHART
A. Scientific Basis Requirement
Direct Quote:
“The natal chart. You saw the chart before. This is the dual wheel natal chart. This is the only system of astrology that teaches it like this. Alchemystic astrology recognizes that there are mechanics that create how things work and how things manifest in this world. It has to be scientifically based or it is garbage.”
Rejection of Placidus:
“When you look at a natal chart and people just look at the houses and they say, ‘Oh, Placidus, we’re going to cut the lines like this.’ And say that, you know, the planet or the sun itself goes a certain distance over a certain amount of time. And we’re going to mark that as a house cusp. No, that doesn’t mean anything. There’s no reason to do that because the mechanics are…”
________________


B. Inner Wheel vs. Outer Wheel
PDF Slide 14:
INNER WHEEL:
 “The center of a Natal Chart comprises the core of your zodiac energies as imbued to you through Earth. We call the 12 inner sections within this wheel the Houses. Natural Rulership will replace the numbers 1 through 12 to give you True Placements. These 12 sections become the lens in which energy travels and dictates Planetary Rulership.”
OUTER WHEEL:
 “The outer ring / outer wheel of a Natal Chart comprises the zodiac energies extended beyond Earth, relationally and spatially. This is the membrane in which all energy transfers.”
________________


C. Astronomical Mechanics
Direct Quote:
“What do you have? You have the Earth that spins on its axis. One rotation, or one revolution. One rotation. Sorry, I had the right word the first time. One rotation is called a sidereal rotation. It is going from here, spinning 360 degrees, and getting back to the same point. One circular orbit of the Earth going around the Sun, that is a revolution. That’s the sidereal revolution.”
Zodiac Sign Creation:
"Now, the position of the sun, the ecliptic we talked about before, wherever that sun is, designates the zodiac signs because of its declination. So when we look over there, based on how high or low the sun goes, based on our axial tilt, the Earth doesn’t sit like this—it sits tilted. It’s also called obliquity, for those of you who like technical terms.
When the sun looks like this, we are at the peak, we’re in Cancer. When it’s all the way at the bottom, we’re at the lowest point, we are in Capricorn. And then there’s a variance in between. That creates the zodiac signs."
NOT Constellations:
“They are not based on constellations. We don’t care where the constellations are. Those are only relevant as marker points in a sidereal structure. This becomes a tropical structure because we’re talking about the seasons, essentially, and the mechanism that creates those seasons.”
________________


D. How Houses Form
Direct Quote:
"So as the Earth spins, its ascendant point, its horizon marker, so wherever the horizon is and where that meets the ecliptic, that point is going to keep moving as I rotate. And that is the Earth spinning, and that is how we get the houses and the ascendant point itself.
The universe doesn’t spin. The universe is static."
________________


E. Earth IS the Center
PDF Slide 15:
THE CENTER:
 “At the very center of the entire thing is Earth. All energies are based on this locational X. Your cosmic blueprint is hyper-dependent on the exact location of your birth. This is a marker in time-space. Not just when, but where. All coordinates based on this point become YOU.”
Direct Quote:
“The center of the natal chart comprises your core of your energy. And this is why, when we get to true placements, if you’ve ever caught me on TikTok and I’ve done true placements for people, and I say, ‘People will be like, oh, I’m a Sagittarius,’ and, you know, they go, ‘They’re a Sagittarius rising.’ I say, ‘No, you’re not a Sagittarius. You’re an Aries.’”
True Placements Explanation:
"The reason why I say that, and if you go into the replay realm, you’ll see a webinar for true placements. The reason why that matters so much is because you are based on the Earth’s energies. You and everything that exists upon you is an extension of the Earth, and the Earth spinning is the inner wheel.
So therefore, no—you are not a Sagittarius. If you have a Sagittarius ascendant, you are in Aries because the ascendant sits in your first house. The first house is naturally ruled by Aries. Therefore, you, in terms of the position of that placement—your sun—technically you’re not in Aries because you’re not a sign, but your sun placement is in Aries. And then secondly, expresses through Sagittarius energy.
So the way you express yourself is going to be direct. That direction is going to go through something expansive. You do not express yourself expansively without the direct part of it."
________________


F. Houses = Fields (More Important Than Signs)
Direct Quote:
"So the inner wheel is the core of your energies. Those houses that we call fields in alchemistic astrology are arguably more important, at least initially pertinent, over the zodiac signs themselves.
Other systems of astrology prioritize the zodiac signs, and that is incorrect. That’s why nobody can read a chart. And they certainly can’t align with it because their information is wrong."
________________


G. Natural Rulership = True Placements
Direct Quote:
“We call the 12 intersections of this wheel the houses. Natural rulership will replace the numbers 1 through 12 to give you true placements. 1 is Aries, 2 is Taurus, 3 is Gemini, 4 is Cancer. If I am looking at my eighth house, the eighth house is the eighth zodiac. The eighth zodiac is Scorpio. So therefore, if I have any planets in the eighth house, they are Scorpio planets. They are Scorpio placements.”
Example:
 8th House = 8th Zodiac = Scorpio
Any planet in 8th house = Scorpio planet (by natural rulership)
________________


H. The Outer Membrane - Tone
Direct Quote:
“The outer ring is the universe outside. It becomes the stained glass window that we peer through. That comprises the zodiac energies that extend beyond Earth, relationally and spatially. Not the Earth itself, but everything outside the Earth. These sections become the lens. We call these the tone. This is what dictates planetary rulership.”
Rulership Determination:
"So if you have those eighth house placements, because we’re talking about the house, you do not look at the ruler of the house. You’re not looking for Pluto in a chart to know what your eighth house placements are. If your eighth house is in Scorpio because you’re a Capricorn rising, then the ruler is still going to be the sun.
Because you have to get to that outer membrane. Like I said here, this is the membrane in which all energy transfers."
________________


I. Transit Interaction Through Membrane
Direct Quote:
"When transits sit out here, they go through the membrane to get to you. So when you have, for that same example, when you have Venus in, well, right now we have a Mercury retrograde in Leo. It is permeating Leo themes to get to your Scorpio themes. It is not in your Scorpio themes. It is permeating through Leo. It is going through.
You have to think of this as a two-way window. It has to get through Leo to get to that. So it has to get through confidence. It has to get through presence. It has to get through ego, personality, character to be able to get to your debt, to be able to get to your shared resources, to get to your trauma. It is the barrier between you and the outside world and the universe and also the outside world and you, also within synastry."
________________


J. House Overlay Requires Sign Context
Direct Quote:
"You can’t just look at house overlays. You hear that all the time. ‘Oh, their second house overlays my first house, so their value overlays my sense of self.’ Yeah, through what? What’s the zodiac sign? Yes, the house overlay is important, but through what is it doing that? Everyone ignores that.
It only applies to that theme. So if the house overlay is Gemini, then this only happens through communication, siblings, how you think, ideas, local environment, so on and so forth. It doesn’t happen with everything else. It only happens within that energy."
________________


K. Where’s Earth? Everywhere.
Direct Quote:
"The center, the earth, that’s the earth. So people say, ‘Where’s the earth in a chart?’ Everywhere. The whole damn chart is the earth. You as an extension, every point is sensitive. So if my body was the earth, and I tap my hand, that’s different than if I tap my elbow.
That’s the same thing with where you live. You live in California, that’s different than if you lived in Slovenia. It’s going to have a different effect, different energies. Anytime you move, the relocated chart shifts. So this is your static natal chart. You have your relocated chart. You’re gonna see that it’s gonna do this. It’s gonna shift. This stays the same [inner wheel]. This changes the pinpoint of how you interact with that area of the planet because you are pre-mapped to the entire globe."
________________


L. Transits = Universe’s Synastry With You
PDF Slide 15:
TRANSITS:
 “These are the planets in the Universe that are not a part of your personal chart. Each one will pass through an energy shown in the Outer Wheel. This becomes your interaction with everything outside of your own Ecosystem, including Synastry with events, entities, & other people.”
Direct Quote:
"Now here, you’ll see that a bunch of different planets will be here. These are called transits. They are the universe’s synastry with us. And the synastry is kind of a one-way street. The universe is huge. It is massive. It is like you and a corporation. You can’t fight a corporation because the corporation is just too damn big.
Or you can fight another person because you’re on more of an equal playing field. You are not only an equal playing field of the universe, you’re minuscule, universe huge. So you can’t fight these things, and you have to understand you have to work with them."
________________


M. Ecosystems Impress Upon Each Other
Direct Quote:
"Anything that’s a separate ecosystem, meaning everything that’s my energy is one ecosystem. The universe and its energy is an ecosystem. You and your energy is a different ecosystem. My business is its own ecosystem. That means it has its own natal chart, its own way that its energies interact within itself.
And when we get into synastry, which is the comparison of those energies and how that affects me and how I affect it, I have my ecosystem. It has its ecosystem. Never is it working with me. It is always working upon me. Can I work with it? Yes. But it is not natural for it to do so. It’s always impressing its energies on me and me on it.
If you and I sit in a room and we’re interacting, you are not talking with me. You’re talking upon me even if you’re having a conversation with me. How you speak is impressing my energy. And I don’t mean impressing like, ‘Yay, wee, that’s so great.’ I mean impressing in terms of pressuring me.
How you speak is going to trigger my energies to have a certain type of reaction. Is it a square? Do I feel like it’s in conflict? Is it a trine? Do I feel like it’s a natural flow, whether I like it or not? Like every single time you’re around me, I get annoyed. Not because you’re doing anything, just something about you. That’s a trine. Trines are not always good."

VIII. THE PHSR METHOD - INTERPRETATION FRAMEWORK
A. The Only Proper Order
PDF Slide 16:
PHSR:
                                                                                                            1. PLANET - Address the FOCUS—this is the “what” (are we talking about).
                                                                                                            2. HOUSE - Where is the planet? What area of life or FIELD are we talking about? This will be a zodiacal energy.
                                                                                                            3. SIGN - We extend what we know into how that energy will express itself. This is the TONE.
                                                                                                            4. RULER - We are back at the Planet, but are addressing the one that governs the zodiac sign we are expressing through.
Direct Quote:
"P-H-S-R. Very important. And this is exactly what it means. You have your inner wheel and you have your outer wheel. Planet, house, sign, ruler. P-H-S-R. You must, must, must read in this order. Alchemystic astrology is the only system of astrology that has a very specific order of how you read energy.
Again, you’re not reading planets, you’re reading energies. And you need all of this."
________________


B. Why You Can’t Use Definitions
Direct Quote:
“This is why you can’t say, ‘Oh, Mars is in my seventh house. That means this.’ No, it doesn’t. You have the planet and you have the house. You didn’t talk about the sign. You didn’t talk about the ruler. And when you expand P-H-S-R, you’re going to insert decans, degrees, aspects, and things of that nature. You don’t have any of that context. You can’t say Mars in the seventh house means anything.”
________________


C. The Interior Designer vs. Abuser Example
Direct Quote:
"You can have one person where Mars in the seventh house makes them an amazing designer and they do interior design for work. You have another person that beats their wife. And that’s very extreme. And I’m sorry if I trigger somebody by saying it that way, but they’re very aggressive towards their partner.
That doesn’t always play out that way, but somebody might say it does. ‘Oh, Mars and Libra, Mars and the seventh house, you’re aggressive towards your partner.’ No. No, it doesn’t mean that. Your energy is directed into partnership, for sure. It doesn’t mean that you’re angry or you’re abusive. Drawing that conclusion is very dangerous, and 99.999%, let’s just say almost everyone, does that. That’s why astrology has been so wrong for so long. You can’t do that."
________________


D. Rising Sign Changes Everything
Example 1: Scorpio Rising
“All we know is Aries energy directs into that. Now, if you have Mars directed into the seventh house, which is Libra energy, and that is going through, let’s say, Taurus. That means you’re Scorpio rising and Aries energy is coming from the sixth house. So that means you’re pulling sense of service, duty, and criticism into your partners.”
Example 2: Sagittarius Rising
“But if you are a Sagittarius rising with Mars in the seventh house, then you are pulling fifth house energy. You’re pulling sense of purpose, happiness, you’re pulling childhood, children in general, which means your children contribute greatly to your partner. That has nothing to do with Mars in the seventh in terms of you’re abusive to your partner.”
Conclusion:
“All we did was change one thing, which was the rising sign, and we have a completely different context of what Mars in the seventh house means. Again, why you cannot have definitions. You’re reading energies.”
________________


E. The Rulership Chain
Direct Quote:
"So this is the order that you have to read. What is the focus? What is the field? What is the tone? And what is it all wrapped up in? And then where is that ruler?
When you go chase that ruler, what house is it in? So the ruler becomes the planet again. So you’re back here. What house is it in? What sign’s it in? Where’s that ruler? That’s the planet again. What house is it? What sign? Just keep this going.
Now, you don’t keep it going without understanding each step of the way. So you just start with the first one. Where’s the planet? Where’s the house? Where’s the sign? Where’s the ruler? This is the order you do for every reading, everything you do."
Recursive Nature:
 Following the ruler creates a chain:
Planet 1 → House → Sign → Ruler (becomes Planet 2) → House → Sign → Ruler (becomes Planet 3) → etc.
Continue until you’ve traced the full energetic pathway.

IX. ASPECTS - ENERGETIC INTERACTIONS
A. Definition
PDF Slide 17:
 “Each energy will make a geometric angle to another energy—no energy is standalone (this is why definitions for placements do not apply). Each relationship is different, creating interactions.”
Direct Quote:
"Aspects. These are the words that you’re going to hear the most, especially in alchemistic astrology. Outside of alchemistic, you will never hear PHSR because it doesn’t exist. It’s a technique exclusive to what we do. Aspects you hear all the time.
This, all it is, is an energy that makes a geometric angle to another. That is all—an aspect is. No energy ever stands alone, which is why definitions of placements don’t apply. Each relationship is different, creating what we call interactions. That is what an aspect is.
How does this planet relate to this planet? How do they interact? How do they feed into each other? Do they repel? Do they hate each other? And I would actually refrain from making them personalized, like adding human characteristics to them. Is there a companion energy? Do they work together? Are they sitting in opposition? So on and so forth—that’s what you need to know about the aspects."
________________


B. Seven Major Aspects (Not Five)
Direct Quote:
"The aspect glyphs in alchemistic astrology, there are seven major aspects. In every other system of astrology, there are five. The reason why there are seven is because aspects have to be broken down mathematically and scientifically.
When you take the astrology wheel, it is 360 degrees. When you take 360 degrees and mark out 12, there are 12 zodiac signs. You are left with the number 30. 30 is 30 degrees, 30 degrees for each house. That means that every 30-degree relationship must be a major aspect, otherwise there wouldn’t be a house associated with it.
To get there from the conjunction to the opposite point—that’s 180 degrees—that’s half of the chart, you’ll have all the major aspects."

C. The Seven Aspects (PDF Slide 18)
1. Conjunction (☌) - Together (0°)
Direct Quote:
"The first one is the conjunction. The keyword for conjunction is ‘together.’ When you see them, they are within the orb of influence of zero degrees. Every planet has a different orb of influence, which is how far that planet reaches. The moon reaches out three degrees. The sun reaches out 10 degrees.
That’s for a future class, but you’ll need to know that when they are at zero degrees or within the orb of that—meaning from zero, if it’s the moon from zero to three and from zero back to 27 degrees, forward and backward three degrees, or the sun from 0 degrees to 10 degrees, 0 degrees back to 20 degrees, which is 10 degrees ago—that entire span would be a conjunction. Planets would be conjunct if they sit within that range.
So a conjunction is together. You’ll see the planets near each other. As long as they’re within each other’s orb of influence, they will be conjunct."
________________


2. Semi-Sextile (⚺) - Hard Stop (30°)
Direct Quote:
"So, you know, in terms of houses, Aries conjuncts Aries. Aries is in a semi-sextile with Taurus. It is 30 degrees, is the next sign over. That keyword is hard stop. This is what ends up creating an issue. When we take action on something, most of the time we haven’t considered its value and a lot of what we do has no value. It literally has no worth to it. You maximize the abilities of Aries, the first planet, when you put it into something that is of value.
So this is what that glyph will look like. It’s showing two different directions. That’s exactly what it feels like. A convergence. You need to pull those two things into one spot."
________________


3. Sextile (⚹) - Companion (60°)
Direct Quote:
“When you get to the sextile, this is what’s called a companion energy. It’s 60 degrees apart. A lot of times in other systems you’ll hear a 60-degree aspect known as a mini trine. It is not a mini trine. This is the trine over here at 120 degrees. It is half of that. It is not half of the effect. It has nothing to do with the trine. It is a companion partnership energy. It means you have to consider the other energy and they have to be used together to either resolve what you’re trying to do or just realize that it’s there.”
________________


4. Square (□) - Conflict (90°)
Direct Quote:
“A square is conflict. It’s 90 degrees. It’s also growth, by the way. Squares are very important, can be very positive. This is what that’s going to look like.”
Key Insight: Squares = growth through conflict (not inherently negative)
________________


5. Trine (△) - Direct Effect (120°)
Direct Quote:
“The trine, the triangle, is going to be the direct effect. No matter what happens from the first, it is going to affect the second. Trines are not always easy. In fact, usually they’re not easy. It’s 120 degrees apart within the orbits of influence.”
Key Insight: Trines create unavoidable flow between energies—NOT always pleasant or helpful.
________________


6. Quincunx (⚻) - Toggle (150°)
Direct Quote:
"The next one is a quincunx. It is a toggle. It’s 150 degrees. A toggle means I can do this or I can do that, but I cannot do both at the same time. You take any house that’s 150 degrees apart. For instance, you can’t have rage and anger at the same time.
You cannot hold something in and do something about it at the same time. It’s one or the other. Scorpio Aries. Either it’s repressed and it’s within and I’m holding on to it and just within me, or I’m pushing all of that out and doing something with it.
And there is an order. It has to go from the 8th to the 1st. It does not go from the 1st to the 8th. Action and anger does not contribute to trauma. You being angry doesn’t make you rageful. Being rageful makes you angry. 8th to 1st."
________________


7. Opposition (☍) - Counterbalance (180°)
Direct Quote:
"Opposition, first and seventh, for a good example, is about counterbalancing. Counterbalancing does not mean combining. So you’ll read a lot of people, a lot of things for astrology that’ll say 180 degrees apart, something that’s in opposition is about finding the middle ground.
And technically there is a compromise there, but the compromise is not to lose either. It is to say, ‘How do we make both of these work without losing the essence of either?’ And this is where people get really stuck."
Aries-Libra Opposition Example:
"Aries is in opposition to Libra, not because you are—Libra is the compromise. Libra is the balancing. The opposition to Aries is not. So I’ve seen it taught that the opposition carries Libra energy because you have to balance the energies. That is very, very wrong.
Whenever you’re talking about Aries energy and Libra energy, and they’re in opposition of each other, yes, Libra has to do with those things, but it does not relate to the association with Aries."
The Correct Understanding:
"Aries says, ‘How do I maintain myself, the things that I want to do, and my autonomy while also being in a relationship?’ Most people lose that. They side one way or the other. It becomes a seesaw. You need to find the middle ground of the seesaw where it’s not teetering on one end.
That doesn’t mean coming to the middle. It means balancing both of them equally at the same time from their respective points. Maintain this, maintain this. This will feel like it’s detracting from this. This will feel like it’s detracting from this.
When you’re in a relationship, you feel like you can’t do your own stuff. When you’re doing your own stuff, you feel like you can’t be partnering with somebody else or you won’t be able to do your own stuff because you won’t be autonomous.
There is a natural opposition of those energies. It’s about this [maintaining both ends], not meeting in the middle. In fact, if you meet in the middle of a seesaw, what happens? It doesn’t stay like this. It does this crap. It’s way out of balance because you’re trying to meet in the middle of something when Libra means that and opposition does not."

X. THE FOUR VITALITY ANCHORS (ANGLES)
A. Alchemystic Terminology
Direct Quote:
“Vitality anchors. This is an alchemical astrology term. These are the four main things. You see them all the time. The ascendant, the descendant, the midheaven, and the subheaven.”
________________


B. Subheaven vs. IC/Nadir Distinction
Direct Quote:
"The subheaven is also alchemical. It is not the nadir. The nadir is a different point. If you draw a line straight through the earth at the very bottom, that is the nadir. If you look straight up, that is not the midheaven. That is the zenith.
So it’s very important that you do not call the Midheaven the Zenith. You do not call the IC the Nadir. When I first started learning, that’s how I learned them. That’s wrong."
Correct Terms:
                                                                                                            * Zenith = straight up (NOT Midheaven)
                                                                                                            * Nadir = straight down through Earth (NOT IC/Subheaven)
                                                                                                            * Midheaven = ecliptic peak
                                                                                                            * Subheaven = ecliptic anchor
________________


C. Mathematical Points, Not Bodies
Direct Quote:
"The ascendant is a point. The descendant’s a point. These are all mathematical points. They don’t have an orb of influence. They are always in a forced aspect, meaning any planet that is touching any of these points is not being pushed by these points. It is being enveloped by them.
So if you have your sun conjunct the midheaven, the midheaven is not acting upon the sun. The sun is forcing the midheaven to be a part of it.
When we get into forced and true aspects, this will make much more sense. Again, that’s also in my book. They’re not visible celestial bodies. They are rooted in the astronomical trigonometry that involves the ecliptic. Again, there’s that word again. So all of these are rooted in where the plane of reality sits."
________________


D. Ascendant - Emergence
PDF Slide 19:
 ASCENDANT - EMERGENCE (1ST HOUSE)
Direct Quote:
"The ascendant, the key word for the ascendant, is emergence. This is where you come out into the world and through your actions. It only sits in the first house. Every time you come up and you say, ‘This is my motivation,’ ‘This is how I’m going to do it,’ ‘This is why I’m doing it,’ and ‘This is the way that I’m going to do it,’ it’s always through your action. That is the key word of ascendant.
It is not the mask you wear. It is not how you show up. The first house is how you show up. The ascendant is why you showed up."
________________


E. Descendant - Submergence
PDF Slide 19:
 DESCENDANT - SUBMERGENCE (7TH HOUSE)
Direct Quote:
"The descendant is submergence. It is not my partner. My partner is Libra. That’s the seventh house itself. The descendant is what you want to bring from the physical realm back into your private realm, from the public to your personal.
Your descendant is you need to oblige by those energies and say, ‘I’m connecting to you because I want you a part of my personal world.’ That is the sunset point. The sun is disappearing. Descendant. Only connect to people that are going to be the people you want to bring into your personal life. Descendant. Seventh house only."
________________


F. Midheaven - Peak Aspiration
PDF Slide 19:
 MIDHEAVEN - PEAK ASPIRATION (1ST-7TH HOUSE RANGE)
Direct Quote:
“Midheaven. Peak aspiration. Highest public visibility. The midheaven can show up in the first house. The midheaven can show up in the seventh house, and it can appear in any house as long as it’s above the ascendant-descendant axis. So you can have your midheaven and your ascendant in the first house.”
Geographic Variation:
 Midheaven location varies depending on birth location on Earth. Can fall anywhere above the horizon axis.
________________


G. Subheaven - Core Anchor
PDF Slide 19:
 SUBHEAVEN - CORE ANCHOR (1ST-7TH HOUSE RANGE)
Direct Quote:
"The subheaven, which is what lies before it, is your core anchor. This is your deepest emotional truths. This is what keeps you tethered to this world. It can show up in the first house, it can show up in the seventh house, and anywhere below the ascendant-descendant axis, depending on where you are on this planet. It is what pulls you and roots you to reality.
It has nothing to do with Cancer. It has nothing to do with where you came from. It has nothing to do with your emotional stability. It is not Cancer. It has nothing to do with the fourth house whatsoever. Can you have it in the fourth house? Absolutely. And in that case, it will show up through your ancestry. It’ll show up through what makes you emotionally secure. But this is not that.
It is an anchor of what pulls you to this earth and makes you feel grounded on a very personal level. I don’t—nobody sees this way. I dive further into these topics in my book, obviously."

XI. FOUR SELF-GROWTH GLYPHS
A. Introduction
PDF Slide 20:
 “You should always be aware of these 4 additional objects and points. They are crucial to your self-understanding and potential blockages.”




Direct Quote:
"Self-growth. And this is the last one that you need to be able to identify. These four are key. And this is at the very beginning when I showed you which ones to highlight, which ones to activate in your chart.
I told you North Node, South Node, Chiron, Black Moon Lilith. And Black Moon Lilith has two versions. Actually, Chiron’s the only one on this list that does not have two versions because Chiron is an asteroid. Black Moon Lilith is a mathematical point off of the Moon, and so are the North and South Node."
________________


B. Orbs of Influence
Direct Quote:
“The North and South Node and Black Moon Lilith have an orb of influence of three degrees because they are moon-derived. Chiron has an orb of influence of a degree to a degree and a half. We’re still whittling that one down. A half max degree is where we’re sitting at so far.”
________________


C. North Node ☊ - Future Trajectory
PDF Slide 20:
 NORTH NODE:
 “Calculation of the Moon heading South to North across the Ecliptic. It carries a forward momentum, future trajectory, and unease due to being unfamiliar or beyond needs.”
Direct Quote:
"These are calculations of the moon, which means they’re all based on the moon, which means the North Node cannot be your soul’s destiny unless the moon is the soul.
Now, the problem with that is if the moon is the soul and it represents Cancer and it represents your ancestry, that means your grandmother is your soul. So this is why we have to be very cautious on how we word things. The soul is the entire chart. It is all you. The soul is everything. So we can’t call the North Node the soul’s destiny because it isn’t."


Astronomical Definition:
“The truth is that the calculation of the North Node is when the moon is heading south to north across the ecliptic in its orbital cycle the moment you were born. That is the point where it’s crossing between the anchor between the sun and the earth, that line. And we have the moon in its orbit. This is the point from down here to up here where it crosses the ecliptic. That is your North Node.”
North = Future Principle:
"Everything in astrology, especially alchemistic astrology, but everything, is North is future, South is past. Ecliptic is now. Think about the civilizations on this planet. Think about how they form. Think about which ones are more primitive or more historically stuck in the past in their traditions, and which ones are always progressive and forward-thinking.
The forward-thinking, progressive ones are in the Northern Hemisphere. The more attached to how things have always been are in the Southern Hemisphere, and the ones that are living in the moment, in the now, are sitting on the equator. You apply the same thing when you get into the astrology."
What North Node Actually Means:
"The North Node is the moon. It is your emotional needs, your emotional security, your family and sense of family, the things that are going to make you feel comfortable on an emotional level in the future.
Therefore, you can never actually reach your north node. You can never embody or embrace your north node because it is always in the future. It hasn’t happened yet, and it never will. All you can do is align a trajectory towards your north node to say, ‘That’s where I’m going to emotionally grow. That is where it is my out of comfort zone that I need to start acquiring comfort with. I will never be fully comfortable with this energy, but I’m always going to try to align with it.’"
Mother Relationship:
“The north node is a relationship you never had with your mother, but you wish you had. That’s why it’s uncomfortable.”
________________


D. South Node ☋ - Default Settings
PDF Slide 20:
 SOUTH NODE:
 “Calculation of the Moon heading North to South across the Ecliptic. Shows default settings, relationship with family, and comfort zones based off familiarity & routine emotional focus.”
Direct Quote:
"When it comes all the way back around and it’s coming down, that is your South Node.
The South Node is the opposite. It says, this is the relationship I had with my mother. The south node—the relationship with the mother and the family that you always had. It’s the things that became habit, instinct. It’s the things that are rooted in the core of you. It can make you feel stuck, but also gives you great strength and skill. It’s based off of familiarity and routine emotional focus. ‘This has always been the way it’s been for me with my family, with my home, with my sense of security, with my needs. I’ve always needed this. I’ve always been good at this.’ It’s because the South Node is rooted in what always has been.
It doesn’t allow for emotional growth. However, because of the opposition, you use one to fuel the other."

E. Chiron ⚷ - The Authenticity Asteroid
PDF Slide 20:
 CHIRON:
 “Asteroid orbiting the Saturn-Uranus realm. Highlights insecurities, breakdowns in structure, wounds, and where things aren’t normal as you seek what works for you.”
Direct Quote:
"Chiron is an asteroid. It sits for most of its orbit between Saturn and Uranus, so it embodies both themes, but it’s anchored twice to Saturn. We have a webinar that you can watch in the replay realm for Chiron.
This one is about insecurities, breakdowns, and structures, wounds, and where you’re just not normal. This is an authenticity asteroid. This is where things don’t work well for you because you’re trying to do it like other people."
Examples by House:
4th House Chiron:
“If you have it in the fourth house, you expect emotion to process the normal way for you. You’re looking for how you can have typical family normalcy, and you never will.”
6th House Chiron:
“If you’re looking for Chiron in the sixth house, you’re trying to work. You’re trying to have normal routines. You’re trying to have a sense of mental health that is just the norm. You never will.”
7th House Chiron:
“If you have it in the seventh house, you think that relationships are supposed to be a certain way, but for you, they never are. You think that the way that you see design, balance, and interaction with others, your wounds and insecurities, you expect something out of the other person, or you think that they expect something out of you, and then you feel insecure about it when it doesn’t happen. Because it’s not supposed to. You’re supposed to find a way that works for you.”
The Gift of Chiron:
“That’s what Chiron is all about. And once you do, it becomes something that other people look at and say, ‘Holy shit, how did you do that?’ Because it’s not normal.”
________________


F. Michael Jackson Chiron Example
Direct Quote:
"Michael Jackson has his Chiron in Aquarius in the 12th house. So basically, Chiron’s in Pisces, expressing through Aquarius, with its ruler in the 6th house through Leo. His insecurity is about judgment rather than his music, dance, or work ethic. Imagine the biggest pop star in the world having insecurity about music. It’s always that way. And that’s where the wound will be.
And because he’s weird behind closed doors, because he did things differently, it’s also his vulnerability point. It’s where people attacked him. This is where the world will attack you because it’s your weak spot. And you have to stand strong in that authenticity.
That’s why he got accused of what he did behind closed doors, especially around bedtime. Literally, kids sleeping in his bed. That ruler in the sixth house routine, Leo. Kids sleeping in his bed. That’s why he was attacked for that. In his chart, I can tell he never did anything. You can believe what you want, but they attacked him for that because they didn’t know."
11th House Chiron Example:
"In the 11th house, it has to do with your intelligence, depending on what sign it goes through. So if you have Chiron in the 11th house, your weak spot is groups. It is ‘I don’t function well in groups. I’m very concerned that I don’t have a future plan. I don’t know how to change things. I don’t know how to be an individual.’
Taurus just associates value with that. ‘I don’t have value in groups. When I’m in a group, it doesn’t seem to work right and I don’t feel valuable within it. My intelligence and the things that I—the way that my mind works, through the resources that I have, I have to use those resources a different way. If I try to do it normally it doesn’t work and therefore I feel insecure about those things. I don’t feel smart.’ And then we have to attach it to the rest of the chart."

G. Black Moon Lilith ⚸ - Raw Emotional Truth
PDF Slide 20:
 BLACK MOON LILITH:
 “Calculation at the apogee of the Moon. Untethered, liberation-seeking, raw emotional needs and truth which disconnect from reality, thus creating deep guilt and shame.”
Apogee vs. Perigee:
Direct Quote:
"Black moon Lilith is another calculation of the moon. The opposite is something called… In other systems of astrology, it’s called Priapus. We do not use Priapus because Priapus is a male fertility god with an erect penis that won’t go away. That has nothing to do with the moon. It has nothing to do with femininity or motherhood.
So you’ll see in my book that I’ve replaced Priapus with White Moon Sophia. White Moon Sophia makes a lot more sense, and that’s what we’re going to use. White Moon Sophia is the direct oppositional point to Black Moon Lilith. It has a completely different meaning. You’ll learn about that later.
Black Moon Lilith is the apogee of the moon, whereas White Moon Sophia is the perigee. Perigee means it’s the closest to the Earth in orbit. Apogee means it’s the furthest away in orbit. So the moment you were born, wherever that furthest point was becomes your Black Moon Lilith."
Mean vs. True:
"There is a webinar in the replay realm about taming and embracing your Black Moon Lilith. There are two versions. There is a mean version and there is a true version. Same thing goes with the North and South Node. There’s one that has to do with the averages that sits very much internally. And then there’s one that adjusts for orbital variances and fluctuations, gravity paths, things of that nature. That is your true. One’s inward, one’s outward.
The one I want you to focus on now is the inward one, Black Moon Lilith. It’s mean Black Moon Lilith. It looks like this. It has the shape of the moon above a cross."
What It Represents:
“This is the calculation at the apogee. It is an untethered, liberation-seeking, raw emotional needs and truth—something that disconnects from reality, thus creating deep guilt and shame. You need to know why you feel guilt and shame around things. You need to understand what’s stopping you from doing things because you feel like it’s not okay for you to do it because the general world won’t understand, your family won’t understand. That point is extremely important.”

🎯 CORE CONCEPT: WHAT IS REVERSE VANTAGE?
Definition & Foundation
Direct Quote:
“Vantage is your point of view, your perspective. In chart reading, we traditionally read aspects in one direction: Planet 1 feeds energy into Planet 2. But Reverse Vantage means reading it backwards. You have to talk about the receipt of it.”
The Problem with Traditional Astrology:
Traditional aspect interpretation follows a unidirectional energy flow model:
                                                                                                            * Planet 1 (the “giver”) → sends energy → Planet 2 (the “receiver”)
                                                                                                            * Astrologers describe what Planet 1 “does to” Planet 2
                                                                                                            * Focus on the active planet’s influence
                                                                                                            * Ignores the receiving planet’s experience, capacity, and response
Example of Traditional Reading:
 “Your Moon squares your Sun, so your emotional needs conflict with your identity.”
The Limitation:
 This tells you Planet 1’s action but NOT:
                                                                                                            * How Planet 2 experiences this incoming energy
                                                                                                            * Whether Planet 2 wanted/was prepared for this energy
                                                                                                            * How Planet 2’s condition affects the manifestation
                                                                                                            * Why Planet 2 feels the way it does about this dynamic
________________


The Reverse Vantage Solution
Direct Quote:
“You have to ask: Did Planet 2 WANT this energy? Is it prepared to receive it? How does it receive it? Planet 1 thinks Planet 2 is the problem, but Planet 2 becomes the solution.”
The Paradigm Shift:
Instead of asking “What does Planet 1 do to Planet 2?”
Ask: “How is Planet 2’s condition FOUNDED ON or SHAPED BY what Planet 1 offers?”
Key Principle:
 Energy flow is bidirectional, but traditional astrology only reads one direction. Reverse Vantage completes the circuit by examining the reception experience.
________________


Why This Matters: The Fundamental Truth
Direct Quote:
“Planet 1 is sending energy whether Planet 2 wants it or not. But Planet 2’s entire experience—its foundational reality—is built on what it’s receiving. You can’t understand Planet 2 without understanding what’s being poured into it.”
Practical Application:
When you read an aspect in Reverse Vantage:
                                                                                                            1. Traditional (Forward): “Your Chiron wounds your Moon’s emotional security”
                                                                                                            2. Reverse Vantage: “Your emotional security is FOUNDED ON the absence/wound that Chiron represents”
Notice the shift:
                                                                                                            * Forward = one planet affecting another (external action)
                                                                                                            * Reverse = one planet’s condition being BUILT FROM what the other provides (foundational reality)

🔍 METHODOLOGY: HOW TO DO REVERSE VANTAGE READINGS
Step-by-Step Process
Step 1: Identify the Aspect Components
What you need:
                                                                                                            * Planet 1 (the “giver” in traditional reading)
                                                                                                            * Planet 2 (the “receiver” in traditional reading)
                                                                                                            * Aspect type (conjunction, sextile, square, trine, quincunx, opposition)
                                                                                                            * Exact degrees and orbs
                                                                                                            * House placements for both planets
                                                                                                            * Sign placements for both planets
Direct Quote:
“You need to know everything about both planets first. You can’t do Reverse Vantage without understanding the PHSR—Planet, House, Sign, Ruler—for both sides of the aspect.”

Step 2: Determine Aspect Dynamics (True vs Forced)
Critical Distinction:
True Aspects:
                                                                                                            * Both planets are within each other’s orbs
                                                                                                            * Energy exchange is mutual/reciprocal
                                                                                                            * Both planets “agree” to the relationship
                                                                                                            * Example: Sun at 15° Aries, Moon at 17° Leo (both within orbs for trine)
Forced Aspects:
                                                                                                            * Only ONE planet’s orb reaches the other
                                                                                                            * The planet with larger orb “pulls in” the other
                                                                                                            * One-sided energetic dynamic
                                                                                                            * Example: Moon (3° orb) at 18° pulls in Chiron (0.5° orb) at 17.5°
Direct Quote:
“When it’s a forced aspect, the planet doing the forcing is trying to pull that energy in. But the other planet? It didn’t necessarily sign up for this. That’s when Reverse Vantage becomes CRITICAL because you need to see how the forced planet experiences being dragged into this relationship.”
How to Check:
                                                                                                            1. Note Planet 1’s orb allowance (Sun: 10°, Moon: 3°, Mercury: 2.5°, etc.)
                                                                                                            2. Note Planet 2’s orb allowance
                                                                                                            3. Calculate actual degrees between them
                                                                                                            4. If only ONE planet’s orb reaches: FORCED ASPECT
                                                                                                            5. If both planets’ orbs reach each other: TRUE ASPECT

Step 3: Traditional (Forward) Vantage Reading
What to do:
 Read the aspect the way you normally would:
                                                                                                            * “Planet 1 [action verb] Planet 2”
                                                                                                            * Describe what Planet 1’s energy does
                                                                                                            * Explain the type of influence based on aspect type
Example (from case study):
Aspect: Chiron retrograde (17°45’ Aries, 7th house) trine Moon (18°50’, 11th house)
Forward Reading:
 “Chiron’s wounds in relating and partnerships create a direct effect (trine) on the Moon’s emotional security and community connections. The wounds around relationships flow into how emotional safety is experienced in groups and friendships.”
Why do this step?
 You need the baseline understanding before you can flip it. The forward reading establishes what energy is being offered.
________________


Step 4: SWITCH TO PLANET 2’S PERSPECTIVE
This is where the magic happens.
Direct Quote:
“Now you have to become Planet 2. You have to sit in that planet’s house, in that sign, with that ruler, and ask: What is my reality BUILT ON based on what’s coming in from Planet 1?”
Key Questions to Ask:
                                                                                                            1. Was Planet 2 prepared for this energy?

                                                                                                               * Does the house/sign placement suggest receptivity?
                                                                                                               * Is Planet 2 in a position to integrate this energy easily?
                                                                                                               2. Did Planet 2 WANT this energy?

                                                                                                                  * Does the aspect type support or challenge Planet 2’s natural function?
                                                                                                                  * Is this energy aligned or misaligned with Planet 2’s purpose?
                                                                                                                  3. How does Planet 2’s condition reflect the incoming energy?

                                                                                                                     * If Planet 1 sends “lack,” does Planet 2 experience foundational absence?
                                                                                                                     * If Planet 1 sends “intensity,” does Planet 2 build its identity on intensity?
                                                                                                                     4. What is Planet 2’s FOUNDATIONAL REALITY based on this receipt?

                                                                                                                        * This is the core question
                                                                                                                        * Planet 2’s entire experience is shaped by what it receives
                                                                                                                        * Describe Planet 2’s condition as BUILT FROM Planet 1’s offering
________________


Step 5: Reconstruct the Narrative from Reception Point
Framework:
“[Planet 2] in [House] in [Sign] experiences its [core function] as FOUNDED ON / SHAPED BY / BUILT FROM the [Planet 1’s energy/condition] that flows in through [aspect type].”
Example (continuing from above):
Reverse Vantage Reading:
 “The Moon in the 11th house (emotional security in community/friendships) experiences its foundational emotional reality as BUILT ON the absence/wound that Chiron represents. Emotional security is not built on presence, connection, or maternal nurturing—it’s built on LACK. The trine means this flows directly: the absence IS the foundation. The Moon doesn’t know emotional security as ‘having’—it knows it as ‘not having.’”
Notice the shift:
                                                                                                                        * Forward: Chiron wounds the Moon
                                                                                                                        * Reverse: The Moon’s entire emotional foundation IS the wound

“You need both. Forward vantage tells you what’s being sent. Reverse vantage tells you what it’s like to receive it. Together, they give you the full circuit of energy.”
Integration Template:
"In this aspect between [Planet 1] and [Planet 2]:
                                                                                                                        * Forward: [Planet 1] sends [energy quality] into [Planet 2]

Step 7: Apply to ALL Aspects (Not Just Specific Types)
Direct Quote:
“This works for every aspect. Conjunction, semi-sextile, sextile, square, trine, quincunx, opposition—all of them. You always need to check: how is Planet 2 receiving this?”
Why it matters for each aspect type:
                                                                                                                        * Conjunction (0°): Planets merge—but how does Planet 2 experience being merged with Planet 1’s energy?
                                                                                                                        * Semi-Sextile (30°): Hard stop—how does Planet 2 handle being blocked by Planet 1?
                                                                                                                        * Sextile (60°): Companion—does Planet 2 welcome this companionship or feel crowded?
                                                                                                                        * Square (90°): Conflict—Planet 2’s growth is FOUNDED on this conflict (not just challenged by it)
                                                                                                                        * Trine (120°): Direct effect—Planet 2’s reality is built on this flowing energy (for better or worse)
                                                                                                                        * Quincunx (150°): Toggle—Planet 2 must constantly adjust to Planet 1’s incompatible energy
                                                                                                                        * Opposition (180°): Counterbalance—Planet 2’s existence is defined by opposing Planet 1

________________


Forward Vantage (Traditional Reading)
Direct Quote:
“Chiron in the 7th house in Aries is about wounds in relating, wounds in partnerships, wounds in how you show up in one-on-one connections. It’s retrograde, so these wounds are internalized, personal, not visible to others. This energy flows in a trine to the Moon in the 11th house—emotional security, how you feel safe, your relationship with the mother archetype.”
Traditional Interpretation:
 “The wounds around relating and the absence of primary relationships (Chiron in 7th) create a direct, flowing effect on emotional security and the need for community/friendship connections (Moon in 11th). The wound around the mother figure affects how emotional safety is experienced in groups.”
What this tells us:
                                                                                                                        * Chiron’s wound energy flows to the Moon
                                                                                                                        * Relationships and emotional security are connected
                                                                                                                        * The maternal wound impacts group dynamics
What this DOESN’T tell us:
                                                                                                                        * How the Moon actually EXPERIENCES this
                                                                                                                        * What the Moon’s foundational reality is built on
                                                                                                                        * Why Ava’s emotional life feels the way it does
________________


Reverse Vantage Reading
Direct Quote (Instructor):
“Now flip it. The Moon in the 11th house—this is your emotional security, your relationship with your own emotions, your sense of safety in the world. But what is it FOUNDED ON? It’s founded on Chiron’s absence. The Moon doesn’t experience emotional security as HAVING a mother, HAVING safety, HAVING connection. The Moon experiences emotional security as NOT HAVING.”
Expanded Reverse Interpretation:
The Moon’s Foundational Reality:
The Moon in the 11th house seeks emotional security through:
                                                                                                                        * Community connections
                                                                                                                        * Friendship networks
                                                                                                                        * Chosen family (11th house = friends, groups)
                                                                                                                        * Collective belonging
But here’s what Reverse Vantage reveals:
The Moon’s ability to FEEL emotionally secure is BUILT ON the Chiron wound—the absence of the mother, the absence of primary attachment, the absence of foundational safety.
What this means:
                                                                                                                        * The Moon doesn’t know what “full emotional security” feels like
                                                                                                                        * Every attempt to feel safe is constructed around a void
                                                                                                                        * The 11th house placement (friends/community) becomes the substitute for what was never there
                                                                                                                        * The trine means this flows DIRECTLY—the absence IS the foundation, not a challenge to overcome
Direct Quote:
“The trine makes it seamless. The Moon doesn’t fight this; it doesn’t even question it. The Moon’s entire emotional structure is built on ‘I don’t have a mother, so THIS is what safety looks like instead.’ It’s not a problem to solve—it’s the FOUNDATION.”
________________


The Critical Insight: Foundation vs. Challenge
Forward Vantage says:
 “Chiron’s wound affects the Moon’s emotional security.”
Reverse Vantage says:
 “The Moon’s emotional security is not just affected by the wound—it IS the wound. The wound is the foundation upon which all emotional experience is built.”
Practical Manifestation in Ava’s Life:
Because the Moon’s foundational emotional reality is built on absence:
                                                                                                                        * Ava may not register emotional security the way others do
                                                                                                                        * “Safe” doesn’t mean “held” or “nurtured”—it means something constructed from lack
                                                                                                                        * The 11th house shows she builds emotional safety through GROUPS (many people) rather than PRIMARY ATTACHMENT (one person)
                                                                                                                        * This isn’t compensation—this IS her emotional structure
Why the Mother’s Death Isn’t “Just Trauma”:
Direct Quote:
“People would look at this and say, ‘Oh, she has trauma from losing her mother.’ But that’s not what the chart says. The chart says her emotional security—her MOON—is FOUNDED ON that absence. It’s not damage to repair; it’s the building material.”

Integration: Both Vantages Together
Complete Picture:
"In Ava’s chart, Chiron retrograde in the 7th house (wounds in relating, absence of primary partnership/mother figure) sends its energy via trine to the Moon in the 11th house (emotional security in community).
                                                                                                                        * Forward: The wound around the mother/primary attachment flows seamlessly into emotional expression and security needs
                                                                                                                        * Reverse: The Moon’s foundational emotional reality is BUILT ON absence—emotional security is not experienced as ‘having’ but as ‘constructing from lack’
                                                                                                                        * Result: Ava’s emotional life is oriented toward community (11th) because her emotional foundation (Moon) is constructed from the absence (Chiron) of primary maternal attachment. This isn’t pathology—this is her emotional architecture."

Why This Case Study Matters
Forced Aspect Dynamics:
This is a forced aspect—the Moon (3° orb) pulls in Chiron (0.5° orb).
Direct Quote:
“The Moon is PULLING that Chiron energy in. The Moon NEEDS to reference the wound to understand itself. This isn’t Chiron imposing on the Moon—this is the Moon requiring the wound to build its sense of safety.”
The Reverse Vantage Reveals:
                                                                                                                        * The Moon actively incorporates the wound
                                                                                                                        * The Moon’s identity is built on referencing this absence
                                                                                                                        * Without understanding what the Moon is RECEIVING, you’d miss that the Moon NEEDS this wound to function

📖 CASE STUDY 2: INSTRUCTOR’S MOON-SUN TRINE (ADOPTION/PARENTAL DISCONNECTION)
Chart Details
Aspect: Moon trine Sun
Moon Placement: [House/sign from instructor’s chart]
Sun Placement: [House/sign from instructor’s chart]
Orb: Within trine tolerance
Aspect Type: Trine (120°) - Direct effect
Context: Instructor discusses being adopted and the disconnect from birth mother
________________


Forward Vantage (Traditional Reading)
Traditional Interpretation:
 “Moon trine Sun is typically read as a ‘harmonious’ aspect—emotional needs (Moon) and core identity/purpose (Sun) work together easily. The mother figure and father figure are aligned. This is often considered a ‘positive’ aspect indicating emotional integration with identity.”
Pop Astrology Version:
 “You have Moon trine Sun! Your emotions and ego work together beautifully. You probably had a supportive mother who encouraged your identity. This is a lucky aspect!”
The Problem:
 This reading completely misses the instructor’s actual life experience: adoption, disconnection from birth mother, fundamental questions about identity and origin.
________________


Reverse Vantage Reading
Direct Quote (Instructor):
“My Moon trines my Sun. Traditional astrology would say this is great—everything flows, mother and father figures align, emotional security supports identity. But that’s reading it forward. When I read it in reverse, I ask: What is my Sun FOUNDED ON? What is my identity BUILT FROM? And the answer is: my Sun is built from my Moon’s experience of disconnection, absence, and the question of ‘Who am I if I don’t know where I came from?’”
The Reverse Vantage Reveals:
The Sun’s Foundational Reality:
The Sun represents:
                                                                                                                        * Core identity
                                                                                                                        * Life purpose
                                                                                                                        * Father archetype
                                                                                                                        * Conscious self-expression
What it’s built on (via Moon trine):
                                                                                                                        * The Moon’s experience of maternal absence/disconnection
                                                                                                                        * The emotional question of origin
                                                                                                                        * The foundational uncertainty about belonging
Direct Quote:
“My identity—my SUN—is not built on having a mother or having emotional security. It’s built on the QUESTION. It’s built on ‘Who am I without that foundation?’ The trine means this isn’t a conflict—it flows. My purpose IS to explore identity from the position of not having the typical maternal foundation.”

The Trine as Seamless Integration (Not “Easy”)
Critical Correction:
Direct Quote:
“Trines are NOT about things being easy or positive. Trines are about DIRECT EFFECT. Whatever Planet 1 is, it flows directly into Planet 2’s foundation. If Planet 1 is absence, then Planet 2 is built on absence—smoothly, seamlessly, without resistance.”
In this case:
                                                                                                                        * The Moon’s experience of disconnection flows directly into the Sun
                                                                                                                        * The Sun’s identity is FOUNDED ON that disconnection
                                                                                                                        * This isn’t trauma added to identity—this IS the identity structure
Practical Manifestation:
The instructor’s work in astrology, identity exploration, helping others understand their charts:
                                                                                                                        * This work IS the manifestation of the Sun built on the Moon’s question
                                                                                                                        * The purpose (Sun) emerges from the emotional foundation (Moon) of not having typical origin story
                                                                                                                        * The trine makes this seamless—it’s not a struggle, it’s the PATH
________________


Why Traditional Reading Fails Here
Traditional: “Moon trine Sun = harmonious, supportive mother, easy emotional/identity integration”
Reverse Vantage: “Moon trine Sun = the Sun’s identity is BUILT FROM whatever the Moon’s emotional foundation is—in this case, disconnection and the question of origin”
The Difference:
                                                                                                                        * Traditional assumes the CONTENT of the planets (mother = nurturing, identity = supported)
                                                                                                                        * Reverse Vantage reads the STRUCTURE (Sun is founded on Moon’s actual experience, whatever that is)
Direct Quote:
“You can’t assume. You have to read what’s actually there. My Moon’s experience is disconnection, so my Sun is built from disconnection. The trine doesn’t make it positive—it makes it FOUNDATIONAL.”

📖 CASE STUDY 3: VENUS SQUARE ASCENDANT (IDENTITY VS. ACCOMPLISHMENT)
Chart Details
Aspect: Venus square Ascendant
Venus Placement: [House/sign not specified in transcript]
Ascendant: [Sign not specified]
Aspect Type: Square (90°) - Conflict/Growth
________________


Forward Vantage (Traditional Reading)
Traditional Interpretation:
 “Venus square Ascendant creates tension between your values/relationships/accomplishments (Venus) and how you present yourself/your identity (Ascendant). There’s a conflict between what you value and who you appear to be. You may struggle to integrate your relationship needs with your outward persona.”
What this tells us:
                                                                                                                        * There’s tension between Venus themes and identity
                                                                                                                        * Conflict that needs resolution
                                                                                                                        * Challenge in self-presentation
________________


Reverse Vantage Reading
Direct Quote:
“Now read it from the Ascendant’s perspective. The Ascendant is your emergence, your WHY you show up, your identity as it emerges into the world. But what is that emergence BUILT ON? It’s built on Venus squaring it—pushing on it, demanding something from it.”
The Ascendant’s Experience:
What the Ascendant represents:
                                                                                                                        * How you emerge into life
                                                                                                                        * Your reason for showing up
                                                                                                                        * Your identity as you present it
                                                                                                                        * Your 1st house themes
What it’s receiving (from Venus square):
Direct Quote:
“Venus is saying: ‘You need to accomplish. You need to be valued. You need to achieve something worth recognizing.’ And the Ascendant—your identity—is BUILT ON that pressure. Your sense of WHO YOU ARE is founded on the demand to BE ACCOMPLISHED.”
The Square Means:
                                                                                                                        * This is growth-oriented (not flowing like trine)
                                                                                                                        * There’s friction and challenge
                                                                                                                        * But the Ascendant’s FOUNDATION is constructed from this pressure
________________


Practical Manifestation
How this shows up in life:
The Ascendant (identity/emergence) can’t just BE—it must:
                                                                                                                        * Prove its worth through accomplishment (Venus)
                                                                                                                        * Justify its existence through achievement
                                                                                                                        * Build identity on external validation of success
Direct Quote:
“Your identity isn’t allowed to just exist. It has to be EARNED through accomplishment. That’s what it means when the Ascendant is receiving Venus square energy. The Ascendant’s foundation is ‘I am what I accomplish.’”
The Challenge:
Because this is a square:
                                                                                                                        * There’s constant tension between being and doing
                                                                                                                        * Identity feels incomplete without achievement
                                                                                                                        * Resting feels like identity erasure
But the Reverse Vantage Shows:
                                                                                                                        * This isn’t Venus “attacking” the Ascendant
                                                                                                                        * This is the Ascendant’s foundational structure
                                                                                                                        * Identity is BUILT FROM the pressure to accomplish
________________


Integration: Why Both Vantages Matter
Forward: Venus pushes achievement demands onto identity
Reverse: Identity is FOUNDED ON the requirement to accomplish
Result: The person experiences their very existence as needing to be justified through accomplishment—not as external pressure but as identity structure

📖 CASE STUDY 4: VENUS QUINCUNX 6TH HOUSE (WORK PERFECTIONISM LOOP)
Chart Details
Aspect: Venus quincunx 6th house
Aspect Type: Quincunx (150°) - Toggle (one or the other, not both)
Venus Themes: Values, worth, accomplishment, relationships
6th House Themes: Work, service, daily routines, health, perfectionism
________________


Forward Vantage (Traditional Reading)
Traditional Interpretation:
 “Venus quincunx the 6th house creates an awkward adjustment between what you value/enjoy (Venus) and your work/daily service (6th house). You may need to constantly toggle between pleasure and duty, finding it hard to integrate both.”
________________


Reverse Vantage Reading
Direct Quote:
“The 6th house is receiving Venus quincunx. That means the 6th house—your work, your daily service—is FOUNDED ON the toggle with Venus. You can’t do your work AND feel valued at the same time. You have to choose: either work perfectly (6th house) OR feel accomplished (Venus). Not both.”
The 6th House’s Experience:
What the 6th house represents:
                                                                                                                        * Daily work and service
                                                                                                                        * Routines and systems
                                                                                                                        * Health and maintenance
                                                                                                                        * Perfectionism and criticism
What it’s receiving (from Venus quincunx):
The quincunx creates a toggle mechanism—you can access one planet’s energy OR the other, but not simultaneously.
How this manifests:
Scenario 1: Working (6th house active)
                                                                                                                        * When engaged in work, Venus is inaccessible
                                                                                                                        * Can’t feel valued, accomplished, or worthy while working
                                                                                                                        * Work becomes duty without reward
Scenario 2: Feeling Valued (Venus active)
                                                                                                                        * When feeling accomplished or valued, 6th house is inaccessible
                                                                                                                        * Can’t engage in productive work while enjoying success
                                                                                                                        * Achievement feels disconnected from daily service
Direct Quote:
“This is why you see people with this aspect who work themselves to death but never feel accomplished, OR they achieve something and immediately feel like they’re not doing enough work. The toggle means you can’t hold both at once.”
________________


The Perfectionism Loop
How the toggle creates perfectionism:
                                                                                                                        1. Start working (6th house) → Venus becomes inaccessible → Can’t feel accomplished
                                                                                                                        2. Try to feel accomplished → Must stop truly working → Feel guilty for not working
                                                                                                                        3. Return to work to relieve guilt → Venus inaccessible again
                                                                                                                        4. Loop continues indefinitely
Direct Quote:
“The 6th house is BUILT ON this toggle. Work itself becomes the proof of worth BECAUSE you can’t access Venus (actual feeling of accomplishment) while working. So you work more, trying to reach the feeling, but the mechanism prevents it. It’s foundational to how the 6th house operates in this chart.”

Why Reverse Vantage Is Essential Here
Forward reading: “Venus and 6th house don’t integrate well”
Reverse reading: “The 6th house’s entire operational structure is BUILT ON not being able to access Venus while working—this creates the drive for perfectionism as a way to chase the inaccessible feeling of accomplishment”
The Insight:
                                                                                                                        * The perfectionism isn’t a personality flaw
                                                                                                                        * It’s the structural result of the 6th house being founded on a toggle with Venus
                                                                                                                        * You can’t “fix” this by working harder OR by relaxing more
                                                                                                                        * You have to understand the toggle and consciously decide which to activate when

📖 CASE STUDY 5: MOON SQUARE CHIRON (MOTHER’S EXPECTATIONS VS. AUTHENTIC WORK)
Chart Details
Aspect: Moon square Chiron
Aspect Type: Square (90°) - Conflict/Growth
Moon Themes: Emotional security, mother, feelings, instincts
Chiron Themes: Authentic wound, where you must be genuine
________________


Forward Vantage (Traditional Reading)
Traditional Interpretation:
 “Moon square Chiron creates friction between emotional security needs (Moon) and the wound around authenticity (Chiron). The mother may have wounded your sense of authenticity, or emotional safety conflicts with being genuine.”
________________


Reverse Vantage Reading
Direct Quote:
“Flip it. Chiron is receiving Moon square. That means Chiron—your authentic wound, where you MUST be genuine—is FOUNDED ON the Moon’s energy coming in. But it’s a square, so it’s conflict. What does the Moon bring? Mother’s expectations, emotional conditioning, family patterns.”
Chiron’s Experience:
What Chiron represents:
                                                                                                                        * Where you must be authentic
                                                                                                                        * Where you can’t fake it
                                                                                                                        * Your genuine self-expression
                                                                                                                        * The wound that demands truth
What it’s receiving (from Moon square):
The Moon brings:
                                                                                                                        * Mother’s expectations
                                                                                                                        * Family conditioning
                                                                                                                        * Emotional security needs that conflict with authenticity
                                                                                                                        * “Who you should be” vs. “who you are”
Direct Quote:
“Chiron’s wound—your authenticity—is BUILT ON the conflict with what your mother wanted or expected. Your ability to be authentic is founded on having to push against maternal expectations. You can’t just BE authentic; you have to fight for it against the Moon’s conditioning.”

“Her mother had very specific ideas about what kind of work was ‘appropriate’ or ‘valuable.’ The Moon in this case brought the message: ‘You should have a respectable job, a stable career, something practical.’ But Chiron in the 6th house is saying: ‘I need to do work that’s AUTHENTIC to me, even if it doesn’t fit those expectations.’”
The Square Creates:
                                                                                                                        * Emotional security (Moon) conflicts with authentic work (Chiron in 6th)
                                                                                                                        * To feel safe (Moon), she’d need to meet mother’s expectations
                                                                                                                        * To be authentic (Chiron), she must choose work that may disappoint mother
                                                                                                                        * The square means this tension is FOUNDATIONAL to how Chiron operates
Reverse Vantage Reveals:
 “Chiron’s wound around work authenticity is not just ‘challenged’ by the mother—it’s BUILT FROM the conflict with maternal expectations. The ability to be authentic at work is founded on the necessity to push against what was expected.”
________________


Why This Matters for Growth
Forward reading: “Your mother’s expectations conflict with your authentic work”
Reverse reading: “Your capacity for authentic work is FOUNDED ON navigating the conflict with maternal expectations—this tension is the foundation, not the obstacle”
The Shift:
                                                                                                                        * The conflict isn’t something to resolve or eliminate
                                                                                                                        * The conflict IS the structure that created Chiron’s capacity for authenticity
                                                                                                                        * Without the Moon square, Chiron wouldn’t have the same drive for genuine work expression
Direct Quote:
“The square doesn’t mean you’re broken. It means your authenticity is BUILT FROM having to define it against something. That’s actually a powerful foundation once you understand it.”

🛠️ RULES & PRINCIPLES FOR APPLICATION
Rule 1: Reverse Vantage Applies to ALL Aspects
Direct Quote:
“This isn’t just for hard aspects or just for trines. Every aspect—conjunction, semi-sextile, sextile, square, trine, quincunx, opposition—all of them work with Reverse Vantage. You ALWAYS need to ask: how is Planet 2 receiving this?”
Why all aspects:
                                                                                                                        * Every aspect creates an energy exchange
                                                                                                                        * Every Planet 2 has an experience of receiving
                                                                                                                        * The foundational reality question applies universally
________________


Rule 2: Especially Valuable for Forced Aspects
Direct Quote:
“When you have a forced aspect—where only one planet’s orb reaches the other—Reverse Vantage becomes CRITICAL. The planet being pulled in didn’t choose this relationship. You need to understand how it experiences being dragged into this energy exchange.”
Forced Aspect Checklist:
                                                                                                                        1. Check both planets’ orb allowances
                                                                                                                        2. If only one planet’s orb reaches: forced aspect
                                                                                                                        3. The planet with larger orb is “forcing” the relationship
                                                                                                                        4. The forced planet’s experience is especially important to read in reverse
________________


Rule 3: True vs. Forced Changes the Reading
True Aspects (mutual):
                                                                                                                        * Both planets participate willingly
                                                                                                                        * Energy exchange is bidirectional by agreement
                                                                                                                        * Reverse Vantage shows willing reception
Forced Aspects (one-sided):
                                                                                                                        * Planet 2 didn’t “sign up” for this
                                                                                                                        * Planet 1 imposes relationship
                                                                                                                        * Reverse Vantage reveals INVOLUNTARY foundation
                                                                                                                        * Often more impactful because Planet 2 has no choice
________________


Rule 4: Read PHSR for Both Planets First
Direct Quote:
“You can’t skip steps. Before you do Reverse Vantage, you need to know Planet-House-Sign-Ruler for BOTH planets. You need to understand what each planet is doing, where it is, how it’s expressed, and what rules it. Then you can read the aspect forward. THEN you can reverse it.”
Why this matters:
                                                                                                                        * Reverse Vantage is NOT a shortcut
                                                                                                                        * It’s an additional layer requiring full context
                                                                                                                        * Without PHSR, you don’t know what’s being received
________________


Rule 5: The Aspect Type Determines HOW It’s Received
Each aspect creates a different reception experience:
Conjunction (0°): Planet 2 receives Planet 1 as MERGED with itself
                                                                                                                        * “My [Planet 2 function] is inseparable from [Planet 1 energy]”
Semi-Sextile (30°): Planet 2 receives Planet 1 as BLOCKING/STOPPING
                                                                                                                        * “My [Planet 2 function] is stopped by [Planet 1 energy]”
Sextile (60°): Planet 2 receives Planet 1 as COMPANION
                                                                                                                        * “My [Planet 2 function] is accompanied by [Planet 1 energy]”
Square (90°): Planet 2 receives Planet 1 as CONFLICT/GROWTH PRESSURE
                                                                                                                        * “My [Planet 2 function] is built on conflicting with [Planet 1 energy]”
Trine (120°): Planet 2 receives Planet 1 as DIRECT FOUNDATION
                                                                                                                        * “My [Planet 2 function] is seamlessly built on [Planet 1 energy]”
Quincunx (150°): Planet 2 receives Planet 1 as TOGGLE
                                                                                                                        * “My [Planet 2 function] must switch off when [Planet 1] is active”
Opposition (180°): Planet 2 receives Planet 1 as DEFINING OPPOSITE
                                                                                                                        * “My [Planet 2 function] exists IN OPPOSITION TO [Planet 1 energy]”
________________


Rule 6: Don’t Assume Content—Read Structure
Direct Quote:
“The biggest mistake people make is assuming what a planet ‘should’ be. They see Moon and think ‘nurturing mother.’ They see Sun and think ‘confident identity.’ But you have to read what’s ACTUALLY THERE in the chart. Reverse Vantage forces you to read structure, not assumption.”
How to avoid this mistake:
                                                                                                                        1. Don’t bring cookbook definitions
                                                                                                                        2. Read the actual house/sign/ruler
                                                                                                                        3. Let the chart tell you what the planet IS in this case
                                                                                                                        4. Then read what Planet 2 receives based on that actual energy
________________


Rule 7: Both Vantages Together Create Complete Picture
Direct Quote:
“You need both. Forward tells you what’s being sent. Reverse tells you what it’s like to receive it. You don’t do one OR the other—you do BOTH, and the complete picture emerges from combining them.”
Integration Formula:
                                                                                                                        1. Forward Vantage: [Planet 1] sends [energy] to [Planet 2]
                                                                                                                        2. Reverse Vantage: [Planet 2] is founded on [that energy]
                                                                                                                        3. Complete Picture: [Integrated understanding of manifestation]
________________


Rule 8: Planet 1 Thinks Planet 2 Is the Problem
Direct Quote:
“This is key. When you read an aspect forward, Planet 1 often sees Planet 2 as the issue. ‘My Sun squares my Moon, so my Moon is the problem.’ But when you reverse it, you see that Planet 2 is actually the SOLUTION. Planet 2’s condition explains WHY the dynamic exists.”
Example:
                                                                                                                        * Forward: “My Chiron wounds my Moon” (Chiron is the active problem)
                                                                                                                        * Reverse: “My Moon is founded on Chiron’s absence” (Moon’s condition explains the experience)
                                                                                                                        * Truth: The Moon’s foundational reality explains why Chiron manifests as it does
________________


Rule 9: Reverse Vantage Changes Interpretation from Action to Foundation
The Fundamental Shift:
Traditional (Forward):
 “Planet 1 DOES SOMETHING TO Planet 2”
                                                                                                                        * Active verb
                                                                                                                        * External influence
                                                                                                                        * Planet 1 as actor, Planet 2 as recipient
Reverse Vantage:
 “Planet 2’s CONDITION IS BUILT FROM Planet 1’s offering”
                                                                                                                        * Foundational structure
                                                                                                                        * Internal reality
                                                                                                                        * Planet 2’s existence shaped by what it receives
Why this matters:
                                                                                                                        * Changes from blame to understanding
                                                                                                                        * Shifts from problem to architecture
                                                                                                                        * Reveals why Planet 2 experiences what it does

Rule 10: Use Reverse Vantage to Explain “Why”
Direct Quote:
“When someone asks WHY they feel a certain way, WHY they struggle with something, WHY they experience life as they do—Reverse Vantage gives you the answer. It shows you what their reality is BUILT ON.”
Application:

2. Interpretation Generation Logic
Step 1: Aspect Detection
                                                                                                                        * Identify all major aspects (conjunction through opposition)
                                                                                                                        * Calculate exact degrees and orbs
                                                                                                                        * Determine True vs Forced aspect status
                                                                                                                        * True: Both planets’ orbs reach each other
                                                                                                                        * Forced: Only one planet’s orb reaches the other
                                                                                                                        * Tag each aspect with this metadata

                                                                                                                        * Store contextual data for both
Step 3: Forward Vantage Generation
                                                                                                                        * Use standard aspect interpretation logic
                                                                                                                        * Format: “[Planet 1] [aspect verb] [Planet 2]”

8. Content Warnings
Sensitive Interpretations:
Some Reverse Vantage readings may reveal challenging foundational realities (e.g., emotional security built on absence).
Recommendation:
                                                                                                                        * Include gentle framing: “This shows the STRUCTURE of your experience, not a judgment”
                                                                                                                        * Provide resources for further exploration

🔑 KEY TAKEAWAYS & SUMMARY
What Is Reverse Vantage?
Reverse Vantage is an advanced interpretation technique that reads aspects from the RECEIVING planet’s perspective, asking not “What does Planet 1 do to Planet 2?” but rather “How is Planet 2’s foundational reality BUILT FROM what Planet 1 offers?”

Why It Matters
                                                                                                                        1. Completes the energy circuit - Traditional astrology only reads one direction; Reverse Vantage reads the return path
                                                                                                                        2. Reveals foundational structure - Shows what a planet’s experience is BUILT ON, not just influenced by
                                                                                                                        3. Explains “why” - Answers why someone experiences life as they do by showing the foundation
                                                                                                                        4. Changes interpretation from blame to architecture - Shifts from “this planet is causing problems” to “this planet’s reality is structured this way”
                                                                                                                        5. Essential for forced aspects - Reveals how involuntary energetic relationships create foundational realities

Core Methodology
                                                                                                                        1. Identify aspect and both planets (with PHSR for each)
                                                                                                                        2. Determine True vs. Forced aspect status
                                                                                                                        3. Read Forward Vantage (traditional interpretation)
                                                                                                                        4. Switch to Planet 2’s perspective
                                                                                                                        5. Ask: How is Planet 2’s core function FOUNDED ON what Planet 1 offers?
                                                                                                                        6. Reconstruct narrative from reception point
                                                                                                                        7. Integrate both vantages for complete picture

Key Principles
                                                                                                                        * Applies to ALL aspects (not just specific types)
                                                                                                                        * Especially valuable for forced aspects (involuntary relationships)
                                                                                                                        * Changes language from “affect” to “founded on”
                                                                                                                        * Aspect type determines HOW energy is received (merge, stop, companion, conflict, flow, toggle, oppose)
                                                                                                                        * Don’t assume content—read structure (what’s actually in the chart, not cookbook meanings)
                                                                                                                        * Both vantages together create complete understanding
                                                                                                                        * Planet 1 thinks Planet 2 is the problem, but Planet 2 is the solution (Planet 2’s condition explains the dynamic)

What Makes This Unique to Alchemistic Astrology
Direct Quote:
“Traditional astrology reads aspects as one planet acting on another. We read aspects as energy exchanges where BOTH perspectives matter. If you only read forward, you’re only seeing half the circuit. Reverse Vantage completes it.”
Integration with Other Alchemistic Concepts:
                                                                                                                        * Energy-First Philosophy (from Transcript 8): Reverse Vantage reads energy reception, not fixed meanings
                                                                                                                        * PHSR Method (from Transcript 8): Required foundation for both Forward and Reverse readings
                                                                                                                        * Seven-Aspect System (from Transcript 8): Each aspect type creates different reception experience
                                                                                                                        * Transmutation (from Transcript 5): Understanding foundational structure enables conscious transmutation
                                                                                                                        * True vs. Forced Aspects: Orb mechanics determine whether energy exchange is voluntary or involuntary

“You have to read it backwards. You have to talk about the receipt of it. Planet 1 thinks Planet 2 is the problem, but Planet 2 becomes the solution when you understand what it’s actually receiving and how its reality is built from that. That’s Reverse Vantage.”

🎓 VERBATIM QUOTES COLLECTION
On the Core Concept:
“Vantage is your point of view, your perspective. In chart reading, we traditionally read aspects in one direction: Planet 1 feeds energy into Planet 2. But Reverse Vantage means reading it backwards. You have to talk about the receipt of it.”
“You have to ask: Did Planet 2 WANT this energy? Is it prepared to receive it? How does it receive it? Planet 1 thinks Planet 2 is the problem, but Planet 2 becomes the solution.”
“Planet 1 is sending energy whether Planet 2 wants it or not. But Planet 2’s entire experience—its foundational reality—is built on what it’s receiving. You can’t understand Planet 2 without understanding what’s being poured into it.”
On Trines (Critical Correction):
“Trines are NOT about things being easy or positive. Trines are about DIRECT EFFECT. Whatever Planet 1 is, it flows directly into Planet 2’s foundation. If Planet 1 is absence, then Planet 2 is built on absence—smoothly, seamlessly, without resistance.”
“The trine makes it seamless. The Moon doesn’t fight this; it doesn’t even question it. The Moon’s entire emotional structure is built on ‘I don’t have a mother, so THIS is what safety looks like instead.’ It’s not a problem to solve—it’s the FOUNDATION.”
On Forced Aspects:
“When it’s a forced aspect, the planet doing the forcing is trying to pull that energy in. But the other planet? It didn’t necessarily sign up for this. That’s when Reverse Vantage becomes CRITICAL because you need to see how the forced planet experiences being dragged into this relationship.”
“The Moon is PULLING that Chiron energy in. The Moon NEEDS to reference the wound to understand itself. This isn’t Chiron imposing on the Moon—this is the Moon requiring the wound to build its sense of safety.”
On Structure vs. Content:
“The biggest mistake people make is assuming what a planet ‘should’ be. They see Moon and think ‘nurturing mother.’ They see Sun and think ‘confident identity.’ But you have to read what’s ACTUALLY THERE in the chart. Reverse Vantage forces you to read structure, not assumption.”
“You can’t assume. You have to read what’s actually there. My Moon’s experience is disconnection, so my Sun is built from disconnection. The trine doesn’t make it positive—it makes it FOUNDATIONAL.”
On Application:
“This works for every aspect. Conjunction, semi-sextile, sextile, square, trine, quincunx, opposition—all of them. You always need to check: how is Planet 2 receiving this?”
“You need both. Forward tells you what’s being sent. Reverse tells you what it’s like to receive it. You don’t do one OR the other—you do BOTH, and the complete picture emerges from combining them.”
“When someone asks WHY they feel a certain way, WHY they struggle with something, WHY they experience life as they do—Reverse Vantage gives you the answer. It shows you what their reality is BUILT ON.”
On Integration:
“Traditional astrology reads aspects as one planet acting on another. We read aspects as energy exchanges where BOTH perspectives matter. If you only read forward, you’re only seeing half the circuit. Reverse Vantage completes it.”

🎯 WEBINAR PURPOSE & INTRODUCTION
Why This Webinar Exists
Direct Quote:
“Hey, everybody. Welcome to the Zodiac Energy’s walkthrough webinar. This is just kind of a long time coming. For people who have already been learning, this is kind of a refresher course for people who are new and are jumping in. And my foundation’s masterclass, the legacy one that most people are jumping into, is a very dense course, and we already go through a lot of this material in there. We want to kind of go back and just refresh, make sure that what you’re learning is everything that you’re going to need. And look at the lens of Zodiac themes in a different way, so that we’re going to go through so that it’s very basic, very beginners-oriented.”
Target Audience:
                                                                                                                        * Beginners: Complete newcomers to Alchemistic Astrology
                                                                                                                        * Refreshers: Students from the Foundation Masterclass reviewing material
                                                                                                                        * New theory students: Those learning FREE theory for the first time
What Makes This Different:
Direct Quote:
“But I’m introducing free theory, which is something I didn’t introduce in my courses before, which is the foundational relationship of energetic expression.”
This webinar introduces a NEW framework (FREE theory) not covered in previous courses, making it essential even for advanced students.

📖 FREE THEORY: FOUNDATIONAL RELATIONSHIP OF ENERGETIC EXPRESSION
What Is FREE Theory?
Direct Quote:
“It’s something that is a major chapter in my book, I Fixed Astrology, and its purpose is to understand how to concisely pinpoint what an energy means based on its natural relationship to every other relationship. So if you’re talking about Aries, what does it mean to Taurus? What does it mean to Gemini? What does it mean to Cancer? And by understanding those relationships, you know definitively that a certain sign cannot mean something other than what it actually means.”
Core Concept:
FREE theory uses the aspectual relationships between zodiac signs to PROVE what each sign must mean. By examining how each sign relates to every other sign through major aspects (semi-sextile, sextile, square, trine, quincunx, opposition), we can definitively determine:
                                                                                                                        * What a sign MUST include
                                                                                                                        * What a sign CANNOT mean
                                                                                                                        * How signs support, conflict with, or depend on each other

The Saturn/Father Example: How FREE Theory Corrects Astrology
The Problem:
Direct Quote:
“A good, for instance, example of that is Saturn. There are a lot of people in the astrology community who believe that Saturn rules the father. And when you look at how it’s positioned in the chart, Saturn being a square to Aries, which Aries is you and your actions, how you show up in the physical world, would mean that your father would always be challenging you as an undercurrent, always.”
Why This Is Wrong (FREE Theory Proof):
Direct Quote:
“Thematically, across the board, your father would be an issue in your life. Now, obviously, some of you, that might be true, but that’s because of the placements. That’s because of the rulerships. That is your individual expression of energy. But an undercurrent of everyone, it doesn’t apply that way. So the undercurrent is that it does not— the father, if it were Capricorn, does not challenge us in terms of just existence. Also, it would mean that the mother at the fourth house and the father at the tenth house would be an always opposites. They would never work together; they would always be the mother’s over here, the father’s over here. There’s no real unity allowed. We know that that’s not true. The mother tends to support the father; the mother has themes; the father has themes.”
The Correct Answer (Via FREE Theory):
Direct Quote:
“We know that Saturn cannot rule the father for those reasons. It’s the reason why we know that Leo rules the father. The fifth house rules the father. The sun rules the father because a semi-sextile, although creates a hard stop in your life in terms of the energies of Cancer into the energies of Leo. Once you understand what Leo needs and the purpose of Leo, the fourth house funnels directly into a direct cohesive integration with the fifth house. And that is when you would see your parents in unison. You would see your emotional security and your desire for purpose to have that cohesion, which would make you feel fulfillment.”
The FREE Theory Logic:
                                                                                                                        1. Cancer (4th house) = Mother, emotional security
                                                                                                                        2. Leo (5th house) = Father, purpose, vitality
                                                                                                                        3. Cancer and Leo are in semi-sextile (30°)
                                                                                                                        4. Semi-sextile = needs understanding to flow, or feels blocked
                                                                                                                        5. Mother and father MUST work together cohesively for fulfillment
                                                                                                                        6. Therefore: Leo = Father (NOT Saturn/Capricorn)
This is FREE theory in action: aspectual relationships prove rulerships.

How FREE Theory Works: The 180° Rule
The Vantage Shift at Opposition:
Direct Quote:
“Once we pass that, we are now past 180 degree mark. Now what ends up happening is 180 degrees, anything beyond that becomes zero again; zero becomes 180 degrees, we flip it upside down because we have to complete the second half of the travel when we’re doing this journey through the aspects.”
Practical Application:
From 0°-180° (Aries through Libra):
                                                                                                                        * Aries is Planet 1 (the giver/sender)
                                                                                                                        * Energy flows FROM Aries TO other signs
From 180°-360° (Scorpio through Pisces):
                                                                                                                        * Aries becomes Planet 2 (the receiver)
                                                                                                                        * Energy flows FROM other signs TO Aries
Direct Quote:
“Now Aries is actually the end point, so what we’re gonna do here is now, once we get to Scorpio, Aries is the energy that’s being fed into because there’s a quincunx; the quincunx does not go from Aries to the Scorpio energy; it does not go from the first house to the eighth because that breaks the 180-degree rule. It goes from the eighth to the first; Aries becomes planet two. Up until this point, from Aries to Libra, Aries was always planet one. From its vantage, now from its vantage, it is the receiving planet; it is planet two or sign two or energy two.”
Why This Matters:
This creates directional energy flow that is unique to Alchemistic Astrology. Energy doesn’t flow randomly—it follows specific, provable paths based on the 180° Rule.
Direct Quote:
“This energy flow is specific to alchemistic astrology; it doesn’t exist outside of the system.”
________________


Application Beyond Ascendants: Vantage Theory
Direct Quote:
“In reality, it doesn’t have to be the ascendant because of vantage. So even if you were, let’s say, a Virgo rising, you would have Scorpio in your third house. So would it be Gemini’s energy expressing through Scorpio? And from the vantage of you putting yourself in the energy of Scorpio in that third house, that Gemini energy expressing through Scorpio, you would know your mental relationship in the themes it plays in relationship to the first house, in relationship to the eighth house, in relationship to the 10th house because you’re doing that.”
Vantage Principle:
FREE theory applies to any house/sign combination, not just the Ascendant. You can use any sign as your “vantage point” and analyze its relationships to all other energies in the chart.
Example:
                                                                                                                        * Virgo Rising with Scorpio in 3rd house
                                                                                                                        * Put yourself in Scorpio’s vantage (3rd house)
                                                                                                                        * Analyze: How does Scorpio (8th house energy) express Gemini (3rd house) themes?
                                                                                                                        * Map relationships to 1st, 8th, 10th houses from that vantage
Direct Quote:
“So whether that’s the first house or it’s your sixth house, if it’s Scorpio energy, you’ll see the themes; you’ll see how it plays out and its relationship within the chart.”

♈ ARIES: THE COMPLETE FREE THEORY BREAKDOWN
Core Identity
Ruler: Mars

Modality: Cardinal
Main Keyword: ACTION
Direct Quote:
“Aries is the first; it is ruled by Mars. It is the same exact energies as the first house… In alchemistic astrology, signs are planets, are houses. They are synonymous; they are the same… So, Aries is the sign, the ruler is Mars, the house is always that first house, all the same exact energy.”

Aries Themes & Keywords
Direct Quote:
“The main keyword in alchemistic astrology for Aries is every single thematic expression of Aries is always gonna come down to some sort of action, and you can see a lot of these words; all these words are going to have some sort of, even if it feels loose, synonymous association with the word action.”
Complete Keyword List:
                                                                                                                        * Drive, passion, movement (physical body movement, travel movement)
                                                                                                                        * Travel (Aries rules travel: “it’s literally talking about go, do— that’s travel”)

Direct Quote:
“Anytime you do something first, anytime you do anything impulsive, reactionary; reactionary is kind of a combination of Aries and Cancer as well, because it has to do with our emotional point. But when we get into it, it is always in conflict of safety, right? When your passions and drive need, they themselves don’t need any sort of feelings of safety, but your security within what you’re doing, that passion comes from, this is who I feel like I am. Otherwise, there is no passion.”

Aries FREE Theory: Aspectual Relationships
Aries to Aries (0° Conjunction)
Direct Quote:
“In free theory, Aries has no, it says NA, but we don’t have to worry about Aries’ association with itself, other than saying it obviously works with itself, right?”
Interpretation: Aries naturally aligns with itself; no conflict or complexity in self-reference.

Aries to Taurus (30° Semi-Sextile)
Relationship: Supportive, Simultaneous Collaboration Required
Direct Quote:
“Aries, in its position to Taurus, which is the second house, the next house over, is in a semi-sextile; it’s a 30 degrees. Remember, all of these are sitting in major aspects to each other. The 30 degree aspect, the semi-sextile, is where Taurus, and from the vantage of Aries, it needs to understand Taurus to be able to support it; otherwise, it feels blocked by Taurus.”
What This Means:
Direct Quote:
“When it’s Aries to Taurus, your actions and the value of your actions are not inherently obvious. So you can do whatever you want. Whether or not it has value could be a waste of energy until you figure out something valuable to put your energy in. Making money is very difficult because we don’t have, that’s the first house to the second to the third; we don’t know how to make money, and then we don’t know the actions it takes to make money. What are we gonna do that’s actually gonna bring those resources and value?”

                                                                                                                        * Taurus (value/resources) must be understood for Aries (action) to be productive
                                                                                                                        * If Aries doesn’t understand Taurus, it “acts a fool”—exerts energy without worth
Direct Quote:
“So, until we understand Taurus, Aries is going to act a fool; it’s just gonna go astray, it’s gonna exert energy, which is also a keyword of Aries that we’ll get to, in an area that does not support actual value. Human beings do this all the time. We exert our energy into things that literally have no value and then we wonder why we have no value, and it makes us feel like we’re not worthy, we don’t have self-worth, we don’t have that value because what we’re putting our energy into is not identified as value.”
Practical Application:
                                                                                                                        * Without understanding what has value (2nd house), action (1st house) is directionless
                                                                                                                        * This explains why people work hard but don’t make money
                                                                                                                        * This explains why effort doesn’t always equal results

Aries to Gemini (60° Sextile)
Relationship: Consideration for Inclusion (Not Required, But Helpful)
Direct Quote:
“When we get to the sextile, the 60 degree, it’s Aries to Gemini, first house to third house. The Gemini energy needs to be considered, so in order to take action, there’s always an element of our environment. There’s something that we can see, there’s something we’ve thought of Now, have we thought it through? Can we see everything? No, but there is an element of that that we have to consider. So, in order to take action, there has to be some sort of thought; there has to be some sort of perception.”
The Sextile Rule (First Half of Chart):
Direct Quote:
“But the thing with sextiles in this direction, you’re going to see when I get to Aquarius, it doesn’t work that way. But sextiles in this direction is that you do not have to use the sextile that is ahead, but you do have to consider it. Aries must consider Gemini, but does not have to use Gemini. I can take action; I can act without thinking; people do it all the time, but the saying is what? Look before you leap. That is that sextile because it’s not a requirement, but it is something that would help Aries along.”

Aries to Cancer (90° Square)
Relationship: Conflict Point Requiring Symbiosis Through Agreement
Direct Quote:
“Once we get to Cancer, we’re at the square, we’re at the 90 degree angle, so Aries at the first house, Cancer at the fourth house. This is a conflict point; this needs symbiosis through agreement, and this is the part that people don’t understand. Anytime you’re talking about any aspect, planet one is always the problem; it causes the conflict because there’s something going on with planet two. Planet two is the solution; it’s where the energy is being directed, so it has to be understood so that we have a symbiotic relationship, and we can have positive outcome from it.”
The 90° Turning Point:
Direct Quote:
“But in a square aspect at the 90 degrees, we’re in the aspect spectrum from zero to 180; we’re at the halfway point. And everything from zero to 90 is for the purposes of the first planet to utilize those first energies to be able to achieve whatever it’s trying to achieve. Once we pass that 90 degree angle, we’re coming over to the opposition; it’s in favor of the second planet.”
What This Means for Aries-Cancer:
Direct Quote:
“When you do things and you don’t feel safe doing them, you get in trouble, or you don’t do them, or you end up doing something that you get hurt. When you do something and you understand what the foundation is and there’s an element of safety and security within it, or you feel good about it, then you can actually take what you’re doing and what you feel good about doing and do something better.”

Practical Application:

Aries to Leo (120° Trine)
Relationship: Direct Support, Autofocus (Floodgate Effect)
Direct Quote:
“When you get beyond that, now we’re starting to get into the oppositional energy. We’re talking about Leo’s energy. Aries is a direct support into Leo, which means it’s an autofocus. From Aries, the energy is going to open up like a floodgate into Leo, first house into fifth house; nothing you can do about it. This is the trine aspect… Now this could be good, this could be bad, but no matter what, it’s going to go there now.”
Critical Correction: Trines Are NOT Always “Easy”
Direct Quote:
“Again, planet one, planet two, we always say, oh, this is harmonious. It’s not true; the harmony is the fact that there’s nothing stopping it. If planet two does it, if planet one is trying to feed energy to planet two but planet two is not readily aligned to accept it, then what you’re doing is forcing energy and creating a conflict, because planet two feels overwhelmed, which is also part of the trine. You can feel very overwhelmed in these areas; it’s too much, like too much of a good thing type of energy.”

Aries to Virgo (150° Quincunx)
Relationship: True Opposite (Cannot Integrate, Must Toggle)
Direct Quote:
“Once we get to Virgo, we’re hitting a quincunx, which is 150 degrees. Aries is feeding naturally where to go, extends naturally into but does not integrate with the quincunx with the planet two, with Virgo. So Aries into Virgo or first house in the sixth house, these energies are true opposites. is interesting because we don’t call it the opposition, but this is your true opposite. You cannot have Aries and have Virgo at the same time.”
The Quincunx Rule:
Direct Quote:
“The function is to identify the first and the second, feed the first energy into the second, and then allow them to operate independently. So, a good for instance is you cannot have autonomy, meaning I do what I want, if you have routine because you are not doing what you want; you’re doing the same thing. You can’t take action while you’re overthinking, processing, and analyzing something. You have to bounce back and forth between these energies.”

Aries to Libra (180° Opposition)
Relationship: Balance (NOT Compromise, But Equality/Symbiosis)
Direct Quote:
“Once we get to Libra, we’re hitting the oppositional energy. So now we’re saying Aries is in opposition to Libra; it requires balance, and I’m gonna help you understand balance because a lot of people think that means a midpoint when it doesn’t, and direction to rationalize. So balance is not about compromise; there is an element of compromise in there only so that these two energies can work together, but not because they’re both giving up something to meet in the middle. They’re not giving up what they are, and this is the problem with compromises, is we tend to think that that harmony, that balance means we have to give up something.”
What Balance Actually Means:
Direct Quote:
“It means we have to meet at a point where there is an equality, where there is a symbiosis, so we have to we have to say well what does Aries need, what does Libra need. Aries already knows but doesn’t understand Libra because it’s literally oppositional, but it’s going to feed its energy naturally into the opposition. So what we have to do is balance out what what we’re feeding in through Aries into what is mutually receptive for Libra, so that we can support it.”

Aries After 180°: Becoming Planet 2 (The Receiver)
The Vantage Flip:
Direct Quote:
“Once we pass that, we are now past 180 degree mark… Now Aries is actually the end point… once we get to Scorpio, Aries is the energy that’s being fed into… Aries becomes planet two. Up until this point, from Aries to Libra, Aries was always planet one. From its vantage, now from its vantage, it is the receiving planet; it is planet two or sign two or energy two.”
From Scorpio through Pisces, energy flows TO Aries, not from it.

Scorpio to Aries (150° Quincunx, Reversed)
Relationship: True Opposite (No Integration, But Rage Fuels Action)
Direct Quote:
“Once we hit Scorpio’s energy, what’s gonna happen is, from the vantage of Aries, Scorpio is driven by meaning; Scorpio’s energy is naturally feeding into Aries. However, there is no integration which means you again, just like Aries and Virgo, with Aries and Scorpio, you can’t integrate these two. You can’t, you can’t be angry and rageful at the same time. However, your rage can fuel your anger, which happens all the time. You can’t, you can’t take action while transforming. You can’t do things while trying to like do things outwardly while diving deep inwardly. Those two things can’t happen, but while you’re doing them, then you dive deeper. It can, it can spawn why you take action on something.”

Sagittarius to Aries (120° Trine, Reversed)
Relationship: Direct Flow (Aries Must Align or Adjust)
Direct Quote:
“Scorpio and Sagittarius energy are another trine, but remember from the vantage of Aries, Sagittarius is flowing directly into Aries, which means Aries must either align to accept it or inform Sagittarian energy. Now, this is where it gets tricky because if it’s in your natal chart, you can do it either direction. You can say, Oh, my Sagittarius, this is what I want to take action on. Sagittarius needs to flow; I need to change Sagittarius to direct into Aries, or you say Sagittarius already flowing. I’m going to change what I’m doing and how I do it so that it aligns with the new beliefs, or the adventure, or the wisdom, or whatever.”
Natal vs Transit Difference:
Direct Quote:
“When it’s a transit, you don’t have that option; you can’t change the sky, you can’t change the universe. This is why aspects in your natal chart and aspects in transits are very different; they also operate differently. And sometimes you read them backwards intentionally because they have to be, because the order flow is different.”

Capricorn to Aries (90° Square, Reversed)
Relationship: Friction Point for Growth (Aries in Control)
Direct Quote:
“Capricorn’s energy Now from the vantage of Aries, Capricorn’s energy, sitting at the top of the chart, squares off with Aries. This is a friction point for growth. It’s different than squaring off with Cancer because Cancer’s a conflict point, meaning from Aries’ viewpoint, from its vantage, Cancer feels like the obstacle, feels like the problem. But from Capricorn, from Aries’ viewpoint, Capricorn seems like there’s friction there, but Aries is the resolution.”

Direct Quote:
“So it feels like it’s being acted upon as a friction point instead of a conflict point, but it’s allowing for growth through conflict clarity. It’s basically saying, why don’t you understand me? Let’s talk; you adjust to match me… So Capricorn squaring off with Ares is a friction point; Ares is in control. Capricorn still has to feed it through what Capricorn can offer.”

Aquarius to Aries (60° Sextile, Reversed)
Relationship: Required Level (Not Optional, Not Consideration—Prerequisite)
Direct Quote:
“From Aquarius, now we’re on the other side of the sextile; remember the first sextile to Gemini, from Aries to Gemini, was there’s a certain level of Gemini that we need to consider. From the vantage point of the second planet, which is Aries from Aquarius, there’s already a level that is there, cooperatively speaking. We don’t choose anymore; it’s not about maybe, no.”
The Sextile Rule (Second Half of Chart):
Direct Quote:
“You’re already saying there’s an expectation that there is, from that sextile, an element, a level in a quantifiable and quantified level of Aquarian energy. So, being able to be autonomous requires a level of individuality; otherwise, you’re not going to be autonomous. To be able to have movement requires a level of being able to change directions; that is Aquarian energy. Without Aquarian energy, Ares cannot do what Ares needs to do.”
Energy vs Exerted Energy:
Direct Quote:
“The physical body and the energy exerted require energy to be able to do so. Now, you’re going to see energy. I didn’t put energy under Aquarius; I put it under Aries. But both of them are energy. One is energy exerted, like fuel burned, and Aquarius is the actual energy.”

Pisces to Aries (30° Semi-Sextile, Reversed)
Relationship: Supportive, Simultaneous Collaboration (Aries as Answer)
Direct Quote:
“Then, when we get to Pisces, instead of it being like Taurus, which is the other semi-sextile from Aries to Taurus, Taurus needs to be understood or feels like the blockage. Well, Aries is the answer to Pisces. All of your spirituality, all of your creativity, it all needs to be fed through supportive, simultaneous collaboration with Aries energy. If you don’t take action on your manifestation, it won’t happen. If you’ve got music and you don’t exert energy to produce the music, it stays in the ether.”
Inspiration Requires Action:
Direct Quote:
“You always need energy, you always need action, you always need direction. Even taking that for, oops, even taking that for passion and drive is all based off of hope and inspiration. Without inspiration, there is no motivation, so it’s a collaborative, supportive, and simultaneous energy usage.”

This tells us that Taurian energy is in a stagnancy or a set pace, and it’s not looking for change. It is not looking for a reason to have to waver. It is not looking for a purpose to start something or change anything. It is saying we’ve already established it. This is what it is and let’s move on.”

“So being the self-value, which means it’s the, again, when we talked about inferior versus superior, it’s the inferior position amplifies this, but Taurus’s energy is based off of that association of when Venus is between the earth and the sun. So it creates anything that is ours of value on a material level or a reality plane that is, I wouldn’t say immovable, but it’s not there to move.”

Direct Quote:
“So we have resources, which can be literally anything that is, you have access to. You know, tarot cards, the cards themselves, are resources. So they are Taurus energy for the deck of cards. It also includes items in general, belongings, possessions, luxury, so value and the levels of value would be luxury, money, and how they can tie into luxury. Obviously, being when you take like luxury and items and you put those two together, you get jewelry, for example, art and talents themselves, because these are self-created art, artwork, because it’s an item that is art. So the actual artwork is art, is Taurus as well; plants and earthly things, values, especially because plants are here as resources.”

FREE Theory: Taurus Aspectual Relationships
Fuel as Semi-Sextile from Aries
Direct Quote:
“…senses, I already said the throat, your talents, and then fuel. So fuel is an interesting one because I’ve seen that kind of all over the place, but fuel is a resource; most often, it’s a natural resource actually, and whether you’re using food for fuel or you’re using gasoline for your vehicle, it is fuel. And that’s the semi-sextile from Aries to Taurus; without the appropriate fuel, you can’t exert the energy.”

Taurus Sextile to Cancer (Security Through Resources)
Direct Quote:
“…you can see this in every, I have a slide for each one of these because you’ll see that with Taurus, Taurus is now NA. Ares requires supportive, simultaneous collaboration to work with Taurus, and then it continues going on from Taurus to Cancer. That is the consideration for inclusion. Do I feel comfortable within having money? Do I feel safe based off of my materialism? I don’t have to feel safe there is an element of security, but how much security? Well, if I don’t have any money, I feel very insecure, or I feel comfortable with it. I don’t need all that money, right? That’s Taurus sextile to Cancer, but Cancer from sextiles, in order for there to be nurturing, I need resources, I need food, so to speak. Houses, you can just do it that way. If I have money, I could buy a house, but to buy a house, I would need money. That’s the same sextile from either direction.”

Direct Quote:
“So we have facts and figures like numbers, words in general, options, or any time you have an assortment or a variety of anything: curiosity, perception, your eyes and your hands, siblings, cousins, co-workers, neighbors, also classmates, which attributes to early learning. Anything at arm’s reach, your local environment, tools like hammers and screwdrivers, or whatever, the different options to be able to use with your hands; those are all Gemini energy. Communication and actual speech, thoughts and ideas, messages and documentation that includes texting, and then early learning, learning in general, but early learning when we’re talking really about the fundamentals, the basics.”

Gemini vs Sagittarius: The Learning Distinction
Direct Quote:
“And that is without any sort of philosophical approach or application So when you’re learning something, just kind of getting the information, information also another keyword that is Gemini, it doesn’t take over. We say it’s higher education but really what it is, is any time you add a philosophical or a wandering approach that you’re not saying this is what it is, that becomes Sagittarian energy on the other end of this.”
The Difference:
                                                                                                                        * Gemini: Facts, data, information gathering, learning basics
                                                                                                                        * Sagittarius: Philosophy, belief-based learning, “what if” exploration
                                                                                                                        * Gemini: “Here’s the data” (perception)

Gemini Square Virgo (Mental Health and Stress)
Direct Quote:
“…free theory, we see here that Gemini is the friction point for growth, conflict, clarity. So we know that Virgo, the assessment is that stress, which is stress, anxiety, our perception, right? That is Gemini’s energy. It counters our mental health. It creates, if I go back here to Virgo, it’s the conflict point. It needs symbiosis through agreement.”
The Anxiety-Mental Health Connection:
Direct Quote:
“Now, we didn’t talk about Gemini ruling anxiety and Gemini ruling your options and what you’re doing and how your brain races and goes back and forth And the stress that comes from that, that contributes to, it quincunxes into Scorpio’s energy, which contributes to trauma. And that trauma contributes through a quincunx directly back into Aries, which feeds into a quincunx back into Virgo. We’re getting into quinconic flow here, but that’s how this all operates.”

Direct Quote:
“Keyword is safety, which obviously is the same as security, so whenever you talk about like a security system, it literally is cancer energy, protection, which isn’t on this list, but that’s another one: feelings and moods, subconscious, as opposed to Neptune, which rules the unconscious, which I actually didn’t put in there; nurturing, care, self-care— those are all cancer energy. Empathy, which is connecting to somebody through mood, through feelings, through emotions; privacy and all things that are private or personal.”

Response vs Aries (Clarification)
Direct Quote:
“Your response to something is an emotional response; it’s a reactive response. That is Cancer, so sometimes you’ll see response as an Aries thing, but that’s actually the action on response; the response itself is Cancer.”
The Distinction:
                                                                                                                        * Cancer: Emotional response, reaction (internal)
                                                                                                                        * Aries: Action ON the response (external)
Practical Example:
                                                                                                                        * Someone insults you
                                                                                                                        * Cancer = feeling hurt/angry (response)
                                                                                                                        * Aries = yelling back or walking away (action on response)

Cancer and Ancestry/Home
Direct Quote:
“Ancestry, your lineage, just going back: mother, motherhood, mothers, grandmothers, maternal-like people, maternity, all of those things, and family— especially on the mother’s side— but it’s usually through a mother’s lineage. House and home, the physical and the feeling of it. Hometown, which includes country, domestication, agriculture— which obviously the tilling of the land, the land being here, and the actual what you do to care for the crops and be able to cycle that through— that is all Cancer’s energy.”
Practical Application:
                                                                                                                        * Cancer rules WHERE you’re from (hometown, country)

Direct Quote:
“It is the ego, it is your character; it’s also characters. So if you’re talking about people, like a person, the existence of that person that you’re talking about is Leo, literally existence in itself. Happiness, a sense of, it’s that sense of not achievement, success, or fulfillment, because those are all Capricorn, but it’s the level that comes before that that contributes to those things. It’s that sense of validation, celebration, happiness, a sense of knowing that this is aligned with the core of your being.”

Leo vs Capricorn (Happiness vs Achievement)
Critical Distinction:

“Happiness, a sense of, it’s that sense of not achievement, success, or fulfillment, because those are all Capricorn, but it’s the level that comes before that that contributes to those things.”

Creative Expression: Pisces Influence
Direct Quote:
“Your sense of expression, sometimes we say creative expression. Creative expression is because Pisces energy quincunxes into Leo, so you’re getting that creativity from Pisces, and it’s fueling your Leo energy. So it is creative expression, but it’s also character expression and personal expression.”

Pisces Quincunx Leo (Depression Connection)
Direct Quote:
“Depression is, by the way, ruled by Pisces, because it’s literally the opposition. Remember, quincunx of the will to live is depression, so quincunx from Pisces to Leo. It’s illusion. Your depression is not real. You’re actually depressed. Something made you sink through Scorpio’s energy to trine into Pisces, but you’re sitting in this cycle of what’s not real, what’s not actually happening This is why it’s so hard to get pulled out of that because you have to jumpstart yourself through Aries energy, which you don’t understand how to. How do I become motivated when I’m depressed? That’s that semi-sextile.”

Practical Application:
Direct Quote:
“The easiest way is find something that you can do, something of passion. Go to the gym; it’s all Aries stuff. Go do something. If you don’t do something, you can sink deeper into depression. If you do something, it’s almost impossible to be depressed because you’re enhancing your vitality. Use your creativity; go color. Doing something is any physical, actionable thing; it doesn’t have to be like going for a run. It could be go for a drive sometimes; sometimes it could be go get a coloring book and start coloring. Anything. Dance. Anything that’s going to pull you out of that, that’s going to take a higher vibration of Pisces energy and fuse it into a new cycle is going to pull you out of that.”

Gemini Sextile Leo (Youth Energy)
Direct Quote:
“Logic, a lot of people assign logic to Gemini; it is not. Gemini is the curiosity, it’s the playing, and it has a youthful energy because it’s in a sextile. Remember, that’s how the sextiles work with Leo’s energy, which is youth. So Gemini itself isn’t youth, but it has a level of youth, too.”

♍ VIRGO: REALITY
Core Identity
Ruler: Mercury (Superior/Interpersonal)
House: 6th House
Element: Earth
Modality: Mutable
Main Keyword: REALITY (also logic, analysis, mental health)
Direct Quote:
“Virgo is also ruled by Mercury and aligns with the same energies as the sixth house, except we know here that it’s the outward mind. It is an earth element. This is why it rules reality, which you’ll see here as a keyword right there. The modality is still mutable, so no matter what, Mercury is a mutable energy.”

Direct Quote:
“It’s the analyzation, Virgo, the organization, the compartmentalizing, all of that is categorization, all that kind of stuff. Anytime when you organize or you do any of that routine, figuring out exactly what you want to do that’s gonna make sense in the world, work and tying that into service. Critique, criticism: you as an employee or you having employees is all Virgo’s energy. Health, details, reality; refinement, efficiency, practicality, precision, accuracy, that’s all Virgo. Utility, the usage of resources is also Virgo.”

Mental Health Emphasis
Direct Quote:
“Mental health is attributed to mental health. Remember, it’s ruled by Mercury, so whenever you’re talking about health, it’s always in the head. So the physical body, quincunx is in, it opposes Pisces; this Virgo energy, and Taurus trines it.”
Virgo Health Rulership:
                                                                                                                        * Mental health (primary focus)

                                                                                                                        * Physical health is secondary (Taurus trines in for physical body)

Virgo Opposition Sagittarius (Overwhelm)
Direct Quote:
“Remember stress and mental health are directly related, so stress needs to be in support of mental health. Stress is not necessarily a bad thing, but when it becomes overwhelming and overbearing through that opposition of Jupiter, that’s where we have a problem And then we have Virgo that squares off with Sagittarius, so that becomes the conflict point; that overwhelm. That overwhelm is the problem.”
The Overwhelm Problem:
Direct Quote:
“So resolving this means focusing on what is going to be best for articulation through mental health, through what is real. And this is where prioritizing things is extremely important. You’re stressed out because you’re overwhelmed; because you’re not prioritizing what actually matters in the real world.”

Virgo and Perfectionism: The Pisces Connection
Direct Quote:
“Fantasy, fantastic realms, the Lulu land, illusion, delusion, loss, lack, anything that is negative in terms of having physicality, anything that opposes reality. This is actually where a lot of people think, because of idealism, a lot of people think that Virgo itself inherently is perfectionism. It’s actually not; it’s reality that’s fed in by an opposition to Pisces idealism to create perfectionism through detail. So Virgo itself doesn’t rule perfectionism but becomes perfectionistic based on the relationship with Pisces.”

                                                                                                                        * Add Pisces opposition = “reality should match the ideal” = perfectionism
Critical Correction to Traditional Astrology:
Most astrology says “Virgo = perfectionism.” FREE theory proves this is WRONG. Perfectionism is the RESULT of Virgo-Pisces opposition, not Virgo alone.

♎ LIBRA: VALUE THROUGH MENTALITY
Core Identity
Ruler: Venus (Superior/Interpersonal)
House: 7th House
Element: Air
Modality: Cardinal
Main Keyword: VALUE THROUGH MENTALITY (value through outward expression)
Direct Quote:
“Libra, also ruled by Venus like Taurus, the seventh house, same exact energies; it is an air sign. So while value is still the keyword, it is value through mentality. It is value through outward expression of mental faculty. It is the value associated with what can be perceived because of that trine from Gemini.”

Direct Quote:
“It is a flowing mental process, this Libra energy, even though it is value. So it’s really value of thought. It is a cardinal sign. So again, we’ve gotten past the mutability. We’re trying to start something, see what’s going to stick, see what’s going to work and play until we get to a point where it’s like, okay, we’re going to maintain this, so that value outward connection.”

Direct Quote:
“A lot of people talk about networking for the 11th house, and that’s true, but prior to being able to network, network is a multiple. It requires, there’s a sextile from the ninth house to the 11th. It requires a level of abundance and expansion. So before you can hit any level of expansion, you have to have an actual connection one-to-one with anybody. So that actually happens through conversation.”
________________


Conversation vs Communication
Critical Distinction:
Direct Quote:
“Now, conversation is not Gemini; communication, thoughts, ideas, all Gemini. But the actual relaying of that and bouncing it back and getting something back through the mental faculties and air is conversation. That is Libra; it is the balance. It’s the reciprocity that we see here: balance, peace. Again, equalizing, equilibrium.”
The Difference:
                                                                                                                        * Gemini: Communication (one-way relay of thoughts/ideas)
                                                                                                                        * Libra: Conversation (reciprocal exchange, bouncing back and forth)
Reciprocity:
Direct Quote:
“Reception, so giving and putting energy out is Aries; receiving, so that you can bounce it back, is Libra.”
________________


Balance: NOT a Middle Ground
Direct Quote:
“Balance is not about compromise; there is an element of compromise in there only so that these two energies can work together, but not because they’re both giving up something to meet in the middle. They’re not giving up what they are, and this is the problem with compromises, is we tend to think that that harmony, that balance means we have to give up something. It means we have to meet at a point where there is an equality, where there is a symbiosis.”
What Balance Actually Means:
                                                                                                                        * Equality, not middle ground
                                                                                                                        * Symbiosis, not sacrifice
                                                                                                                        * Both energies honored, neither diminished
                                                                                                                        * Fine line, not compromise
________________


Grace and Diplomacy
Direct Quote:
“And then we have grace and elegance, which goes into diplomacy and tact, which is really just about not being too harsh, not being too soft. Grace is that fine line; it’s that middle ground. It is that compromise that we were talking about before with Libra’s energy. It’s that oppositional energy that keeps everything from tipping to one side or the other, so that is Libra.”
Practical Application:
                                                                                                                        * Not too harsh, not too soft
                                                                                                                        * Fine line walking
                                                                                                                        * Diplomatic approach
                                                                                                                        * Elegance in handling situations

Libra and Aesthetics
Direct Quote:
“Design, fashion, beauty, aesthetics. These are all how we showcase what is valuable to us on a mental level. It is that artistic quality, but put out in a visual medium, or could be a visual medium, but any way where others can perceive it.”

♏ SCORPIO: DEPTH
Core Identity
Ruler: Pluto
House: 8th House
Element: Water
Modality: Fixed
Main Keyword: DEPTH
Direct Quote:
“Scorpio is synonymous with Pluto, synonymous with the 8th house energy. Here’s your free theory. As we continue on, it is also a water sign, so it’s that sub-level current that is of an emotional nature, of a fluid nature, and the modality is fixed. So although there is a level, you’ll see some of the keywords like it’s not meant to be fast, it’s not meant to be ever-changing. The change that comes with Scorpio takes a long time because you’re trying to maintain something.”

Fixed Water: Cycles
Direct Quote:
“And one thing that’s not listed here, the main keyword is depth. Going down the rabbit hole, conspiracy theories, that’s all Scorpio’s energy. But the one that contributes to the fixed energy is cycles. So you’re assuming the sextile back from Virgo in free theory, which is routine, and you’re going deep into routine, which means you’re doing it again, and you’re doing it again, and you’re doing it again, and you’re doing it again, and these are your cycles.”

Direct Quote:
“Now, toxicity is also part of Scorpio, but again, I can only do so many words; it kind of aligns with all of these other words here. Anything that has to do with darkness or confinement, small spaces, is Scorpio. Anytime you’re diving to the depths of something, another word that’s not on here that’s very important is pressure.”
________________


Pressure vs Impact
Direct Quote:
“So while Aries is impact, Scorpio is pressure. It’s the sustained, that fixed energy, the sustained pushing, essentially, into the depths of something. When we’re here and we’re pushing, pushing, we’re diving deeper. We’re going into the depths of how much we can push. That’s why it’s also whenever you repress something is Scorpio’s energy, and why it’s therapy to go find it.”
The Difference:
                                                                                                                        * Aries = impact (immediate, forceful hit)
                                                                                                                        * Scorpio = pressure (sustained, continuous push into depths)

Taboo and Repression
Direct Quote:
“Crime, mystery, anything that’s niche, taboo, that’s unaccepted by society, but still seems to have some traditional set of society. Like, for instance, there’s a reason why people who are the most uptight, who have that more Capricorn energy, they’re rigid, they’re traditional. There’s always an element of repression there that creates that tradition, and they’re the most sexually repressed people ever for this exact reason, that you have that sextile from Scorpio into Capricorn.”
The Scorpio-Capricorn Connection:
Direct Quote:
“And from Capricorn’s standpoint, there’s already Scorpio’s energy. So there’s something they’ve been stuffing down because there’s a level of conformity that comes from Capricorn, and Scorpio is not. Scorpio is anything that is taboo; anything that would make them themselves from an internal level is being pushed down and stuffed away.”

                                                                                                                        * Most traditional/rigid people are most sexually/emotionally repressed
                                                                                                                        * Sextile means there’s a LEVEL of Scorpio in Capricorn (repressed depth)

Transformation and Decay
Direct Quote:
“Transformation and regeneration; these are all about going to the depths using decay. I have poop here because Scorpio rules sewage and literal excretion of the stuff that we don’t want anymore. Regeneration and transformation; these are all by going deep so that we can come back.”

                                                                                                                        4. Regeneration (rebuilding from depth)

Intimacy and Trust
Direct Quote:
“Dust and debris, the reproductive system, the act of reproducing, which requires oops, which requires intimacy, which is also deep bonds. Kinks, which is that taboo nature over here. Trust, being able to have that intimacy, to be able to have that deep bond, to develop that trust. Companionship, or not companionship, that’s Libra. It’s a word: collaboration.”

Other People’s Resources
Direct Quote:
“Using other people’s resources, which is another keyword, to be able to blend in with what you’re doing with what they have, whether that’s a talent, a skill, or an actual asset to be able to do that. Inheritances, investments, anything that you’re gonna dive deeper in is gonna take an element of time to get out, secrecy, things that are hidden, so on.”

Scorpio: The Most Misunderstood Energy
Direct Quote:
“This is all Scorpio. This is a very, very important energy. I would say, not that there’s an importance; I don’t like hierarchies, but it’s one of the ones that’s so overlooked and misunderstood, yet contributes so directly into your daily life that it needs more correct application and understanding so that people are not demonizing or vilifying Scorpio’s energy.”
Why Scorpio Is Misunderstood:
                                                                                                                        * Associated with darkness, death, taboo
                                                                                                                        * Demonized in pop astrology
                                                                                                                        * Actually essential for transformation
                                                                                                                        * Repression causes MORE problems than expression

“Sagittarius is going to be, here’s your free theory, ruled by Jupiter, synonymous with the ninth house energy. It is a fire sign, so again, actionable, life kind of burning and whatnot.

Direct Quote:
“Because we’re expanding through the opposition of Mercury, which is Gemini’s energy, we’re getting hypotheticals, hypothesizing, kind of guesswork, which is the mental wandering that is all Sagittarian: beliefs, mindset, culture, which is literally beliefs that are infused from family or lineage or a sense of where we came from.”
________________


Beliefs vs Perception
The Gemini-Sagittarius Axis:
Direct Quote:
“So mindset is going to be based off of what we believe, using the opposition from Gemini. So Gemini is the curiosity. We’re taking the facts, the figures, here’s the data, and here’s like, we’re playing with the data to get something that can be logical. Whereas Jupiter’s energy, Sagittarius, is based off of beliefs, which are rooted in a what-if adventure, so essentially you’re opposing the facts and figures. Instead of it being, it’s not the mental perception; it is what we’ve taken from perception and said, this is. This is what we’re going to believe in; this is what we’re going to expand upon, which is mindset.”

Growth Can Be Negative
Direct Quote:
“Accumulation, so the quincunx from Sagittarius into Taurus is going to say, well, we’re going to have a certain amount that could grow, and it could grow negatively, by the way. So it’s accumulation or it’s negative growth, but that’s all Sagittarius that feeds directly into Taurus’s energy. So we have growth. Again, growth does not have to be positive, and it doesn’t even have to be outward. It can be inner growth, it could be downward growth, it can be anything that expands out.”

                                                                                                                        * Can expand inward (not just outward achievement)
                                                                                                                        * Can grow downward (not just upward progress)
Practical Examples:

“It also has to do with your reputation, your public image, the public in general; because that becomes the status quo, becomes the tradition. History, which is time and tradition together, squaring off with, this is the fun one, squaring off with Aries energy is like, did history actually happen that way? A lot of times it didn’t, and the reason it didn’t is because of that square.”

History and the Aries Square
Direct Quote:
“History, which is time and tradition together, squaring off with, this is the fun one, squaring off with Aries energy is like, did history actually happen that way? A lot of times it didn’t, and the reason it didn’t is because of that square. So we would have to understand what could have been and what the actions were to understand the history of limitations, which goes in with rules, regulations, being the best.”

Capricorn vs Aquarius: Records
Direct Quote:
“In this moment, I’ll mention that like this is a completion point for Capricorn. Once we’ve hit the completion point, there’s always that person that comes along and says, nope, I’m better. That’s what breaking a record is; Aquarius is breaking the record, Capricorn is holding the record.”
The Difference:
                                                                                                                        * Capricorn = holding the record (maintaining the structure/standard)
                                                                                                                        * Aquarius = breaking the record (innovation, change, surpassing structure)

Parents vs Father
Critical Correction:
Direct Quote:
“Tradition, authority, anyone in a position of authority; and this is where the confusion of the father being Capricorn versus parents being Capricorn. Parents absolutely are, but that could be mom, that could be dad; it’s anybody of authority or your own authority and how that sits in your chart in your life.”
What Capricorn Actually Rules:
                                                                                                                        * Parents (both/either, as authority figures)
                                                                                                                        * ANY authority figure (teachers, bosses, government, police)
                                                                                                                        * Your OWN authority (how you embody structure/discipline)
What Capricorn Does NOT Rule:
                                                                                                                        * Father specifically (that’s Leo/Sun, per FREE theory)
This corrects a major traditional astrology error.

Consequence and Results
Direct Quote:
“Reputation, respect, elders, which is gained through reputation; consequence, the result of your actions; results in general, anything that’s at the end of something, the finish line is also Capricorn. Endurance, stamina, how long you can go under whatever context. Discipline, adhering to something that would give you structure and actually building something in construction; this is all Capricorn’s energy.”
Capricorn as Endings:
                                                                                                                        * Consequence = the end result of action
                                                                                                                        * Finish line = the end of a race/journey
                                                                                                                        * Achievement = the end goal reached
                                                                                                                        * Death = the ultimate end (covered below)
________________


Death: The Ultimate Capricorn Theme
Direct Quote:
“Death can happen under all those circumstances. … Technically, Capricorn’s energy is the end, so the actual finish line of your life isn’t Pluto, and it’s not Aquarius, and it’s not Pisces; it’s actually Capricorn. Capricorn isn’t how you die, but it is the end. It is the longevity, it’s the time, it’s the definitive conclusion, all Capricorn’s energy.”
Critical Correction to Traditional Astrology:
Most astrology says “Pluto/Scorpio rules death.” This is WRONG according to FREE theory.
The Truth:
                                                                                                                        * Capricorn = death (the actual end, the finish line of life)
                                                                                                                        * Scorpio = way you can die (decay, transformation process)
                                                                                                                        * Aquarius = cheating death (resuscitation, revival)
                                                                                                                        * Pisces = what comes after (unknown, dissolution)
Direct Quote:
“So in tarot, it should be the death card, but it’s not because people don’t realize that that’s what Capricorn rules, death. It is literally the end of exhaustion.”
Why Capricorn Should Be the Death Card in Tarot:
                                                                                                                        * Death = definitive end
                                                                                                                        * Capricorn = endings, completion, finality
                                                                                                                        * Tarot incorrectly assigns Death to Scorpio

Virgo Trine Capricorn (Routine Supports Longevity)
Direct Quote:
“Mental health, remember, it’s ruled by Mercury, so whenever you’re talking about health, it’s always in the head. So the physical body, quincunx is in, it opposes Pisces; this Virgo energy, and Taurus trines it.”

“Aquarian energy is that next step; it’s Uranus-ruled, the 11th house. Again, all of this is synonymous. There was free theory; it is an air sign, so again, it has to do with logistics, logic, and the flow of mental faculty. Then you have modality being fixed, which is ironic.”

Direct Quote:
“A lot of people don’t understand that about Aquarian energy because they’re like, oh, it’s revolution, it’s change; it is all those things, but how does that happen? It’s because there’s something that you’re trying to carry forward, and however long it takes you to do that, you’re going to keep doing it. So rebellion is not just, I’m rebelling now, and tomorrow I’m not rebelling anymore. It’s a sustained effort, and that goes with revolution.”
What Fixed Air Means:
                                                                                                                        * Revolution = sustained rebellion (not one-time event)
                                                                                                                        * Innovation = persistent pursuit of change
                                                                                                                        * Individuality = fixed quirks/uniqueness (doesn’t change day to day)
                                                                                                                        * The future is fixed (it WILL happen, though HOW is variable)
Direct Quote:
“It goes with being individualistic and your uniqueness. Your uniqueness isn’t something that changes; like, your quirks are your quirks. And while you can work on them, they change, you gain some, you lose some; for the most part, they’re pretty frickin’ fixed. The future is fixed. So when you’re talking about it, though, inquiring energy is about oscillation; it is about innovation.”

Direct Quote:
“It is detachment; that also means things that are cut off, so sometimes we talk about, like, death. I don’t know if you’ve noticed, and you’ll see when we get to Pisces, the word death is in a Pisces slide. It wasn’t on Scorpio’s slide, and it’s not on Aquarius’s slide. However, death can happen under all those circumstances.”

Energy vs Exerted Energy
Critical Distinction (Already Covered in Aries):
Direct Quote:
“The physical body and the energy exerted require energy to be able to do so. Now, you’re going to see energy. I didn’t put energy under Aquarius; I put it under Aries. But both of them are energy. One is energy exerted, like fuel burned, and Aquarius is the actual energy.”
The Difference:
                                                                                                                        * Aquarius = energy itself (electricity, potential, source)
                                                                                                                        * Aries = exerted energy (fuel burned, action taken)
Practical Example:
                                                                                                                        * Aquarius = battery charge
                                                                                                                        * Aries = using the battery

Death and Detachment
Direct Quote:
“All of those different energies can result in death because death is a set of permanents, and none of these have to do with things that are permanent. But technically, Capricorn’s energy is the end, so the actual finish line of your life isn’t Pluto, and it’s not Aquarius, and it’s not Pisces; it’s actually Capricorn. Capricorn isn’t how you die, but it is the end. It is the longevity, it’s the time, it’s the definitive conclusion, all Capricorn’s energy. … Aquarius energy is the step beyond that. It is an ability to cheat death, so to speak, but I won’t get into that part of Aquarius.”
Aquarius and Death:
                                                                                                                        * Detachment = cutting off (can include death)
                                                                                                                        * Aquarius = cheating death (resuscitation, electricity restarts heart)
                                                                                                                        * Capricorn = actual death/end
                                                                                                                        * Aquarius = the step beyond death (revival, next cycle)

Technology and Mechanics
Direct Quote:
“It is the mechanics; it is how things work, which is why it’s technology. It’s electricity, which isn’t on here, but it is; it’s that type of energy that contributes to that.”
Why Aquarius Rules Technology:
                                                                                                                        * Mechanics = understanding how things work
                                                                                                                        * Innovation = improving how things work

                                                                                                                        * Technology = mechanical innovation

Groups vs The Collective
Critical Distinction:
Direct Quote:
“Groups, teams, collections, not the collective, because once you start talking about the collective, you’re talking about everyone. When you’re not talking about individuals anymore, you’re talking about a whole, not a group of people; you’re talking about the whole group, which again is Capricorn’s energy.”
The Difference:
                                                                                                                        * Aquarius = groups, teams, collections (multiple individuals together)
                                                                                                                        * Capricorn = the collective (everyone as a whole, society, public)

Nervous System
Direct Quote:
“Networking, connecting to others, expanding out on our one-to-one integrations and our ability to relate to people to create a web, which is also an Aquarian thing. Randomness, the ability to be eccentric and go wherever we want based on those different connections, which is why Aquarius rules the nervous system.”
Why Aquarius Rules Nervous System:
                                                                                                                        * Nervous system = electrical signals (electricity)
                                                                                                                        * Networking = neural connections (web of connections)
                                                                                                                        * Randomness = synaptic firing patterns (oscillation)

♓ PISCES: THE UNKNOWN
Core Identity
Ruler: Neptune
House: 12th House
Element: Water
Modality: Mutable
Main Keyword: UNKNOWN (what isn’t there)
Direct Quote:
“Pisces, which is synonymous with Neptune because it’s its ruler, and the 12th house, same keywords. It is a water element, so we know that it’s about the undercurrents; it’s about the flowing and fluid nature of things, and the modality is mutable, so it’s always something that moves, which is why it rules water when Cancer doesn’t rule water; Scorpio doesn’t rule water because it’s not the presentation or the start of it; it’s not the fixed nature of it; it’s actually ice would be Scorpio.”
________________


Mutable Water: Dissolution
Direct Quote:
“Water in its fluid form, or even vaporized form, would be Pisces, because it has that dissolution; it has that fluid property. Technically, the water that forms ice is still Pisces, by the way; it’s just that Scorpio has overtaken it so that you have Scorpio’s influence to create ice. Erosion is actually Scorpio’s energy, because that’s a decay; it doesn’t go anywhere, so the unknown and Pisces energy requires dissolution. So if there’s no dissolution, if there’s no disbursement, then it’s not going to be Pisces energy; it’s going to be Scorpio’s energy as decay.”

                                                                                                                        * Scorpio = ice (fixed water, frozen/stagnant)
                                                                                                                        * Pisces = fluid water (flowing, dissolving, vaporizing)
Dissolution vs Decay:
                                                                                                                        * Scorpio = decay (fixed, doesn’t move, breaks down in place)
                                                                                                                        * Pisces = dissolution (disperses, dissipates, flows away)

The Unknown: What Isn’t There
Direct Quote:
“So the key word for Pisces energy is unknown, and this is literally what isn’t there. When you’re looking at grand design, you have to realize that there has to be something that means it’s not there There’s actually an aspect that means without, which is quincunx. And there’s a zodiac sign that means without, and that is Pisces. Sometimes you have to read Pisces as I don’t have it, or it’s unknown to me whether or not I do have it, and it could be either or, because it’s unknown.”
Pisces as “Without”:
                                                                                                                        * Quincunx = the aspect of “without”
                                                                                                                        * Pisces = the sign of “without”
                                                                                                                        * “I don’t have it” OR “Unknown if I have it”
Practical Application:
                                                                                                                        * 12th house placements: Unknown/hidden parts of self

Direct Quote:
“So inspiration comes from a place that we just don’t know; hope also. Now optimism is actually a belief in chance; that is Sagittarian energy. Some people try to say that Pisces is optimistic; it’s not. Pisces is fed by optimism; that’s where the inspiration, the hope is. That’s the square from Sagittarius, but it needs to feed into the unknown, which then, through free theory, has to connect to everything else.”

Optimism vs Hope
Critical Distinction:

                                                                                                                        * Pisces = hope (emotional longing from unknown source, not belief-based)

The 12th House: You Before You
Direct Quote:
“And there’s an interesting, before I continue, there’s an interesting element of Pisces: if you look in your chart at the 12th house, that is you before you. It is you in the womb, you floating in the amniotic sac in the fluid. That’s Pisces energy; it’s the 12th house. It is your mother’s pregnancy, actually sitting in your 12th house. The conditions around it are actually sitting in your 12th house, and how you were conceived is in your 12th house, which is fun to look at.”

Idealism and Perfectionism
Direct Quote (Already Covered in Virgo):
“Fantasy, fantastic realms, the Lulu land, illusion, delusion, loss, lack, anything that is negative in terms of having physicality, anything that opposes reality. This is actually where a lot of people think, because of idealism, a lot of people think that Virgo itself inherently is perfectionism. It’s actually not; it’s reality that’s fed in by an opposition to Pisces idealism to create perfectionism through detail. So Virgo itself doesn’t rule perfectionism but becomes perfectionistic based on the relationship with Pisces.”

Mirrors, Windows, and Reflections
Direct Quote:
“Imagination, reflections, mirrors, windows, anything that could be but isn’t, but is, is there. So that’s why you can walk into a window and be like, what the hell happened? Distractions is a query in energy, but things that happen that you don’t see would be Piscean energy.”
Why Pisces Rules Mirrors/Windows:
                                                                                                                        * Reflection = image that’s there but not real
                                                                                                                        * Window = barrier to what’s visible but unreachable
                                                                                                                        * You walk into windows because they’re illusion (looks open but isn’t)

Depression: The Quincunx to Leo
Direct Quote (Already Covered in Leo):
“Depression is, by the way, ruled by Pisces, because it’s literally the opposition. Remember, quincunx of the will to live is depression, so quincunx from Pisces to Leo. It’s illusion. Your depression is not real. You’re actually depressed. Something made you sink through Scorpio’s energy to trine into Pisces, but you’re sitting in this cycle of what’s not real, what’s not actually happening This is why it’s so hard to get pulled out of that because you have to jumpstart yourself through Aries energy, which you don’t understand how to. How do I become motivated when I’m depressed? That’s that semi-sextile.”
The Depression Cycle:
                                                                                                                        1. Something traumatic (Scorpio)
                                                                                                                        2. Trine to Pisces (sink into illusion/loss)
                                                                                                                        3. Pisces quincunx Leo (loss of will to live/vitality)
                                                                                                                        4. Result: Depression (illusion that vitality is gone)
The Solution:
Direct Quote:
“The easiest way is find something that you can do, something of passion. Go to the gym; it’s all Aries stuff. Go do something. If you don’t do something, you can sink deeper into depression. If you do something, it’s almost impossible to be depressed because you’re enhancing your vitality.”
Aries semi-sextile Pisces = action pulls you out of illusion

Escapism and Spiritual Bypassing
Direct Quote:
“Escapism is a big one. We talk about this a lot, or I do anyway, that a lot of people who are spiritual and who dive deep into spirituality are actually just escaping the real world. They’re looking for this fantasy, this idealistic thing that cannot happen, and they, as a result, cannot balance the spirituality with the real world. I was never really anti-spiritual; I just realized that the spiritual community was full of it and just went a different route and thought I wasn’t spiritual because I wasn’t them.”
The Problem:
                                                                                                                        * Spirituality can be escapism (avoiding reality via Pisces illusion)
                                                                                                                        * New age fluff (idealism without reality)
                                                                                                                        * Cannot balance spiritual and material (Pisces-Virgo imbalance)
The Solution:
Direct Quote:
“But in reality, this is something, especially as I was doing astrology, I said, wow, spirituality is so important. I don’t know that I have it. Then I started realizing, well, I do have it. I just don’t have it like other people.”
Authentic spirituality balances Pisces (unknown/spiritual) with Virgo (reality/practical).

Subconscious vs Unconscious
Critical Distinction:
Direct Quote:
“Cancer is rest, sleep. That’s why it’s the subconscious; Pisces is the unconscious. Some people think Pisces is subconscious; it’s not. The moon is. That’s where our subconscious tendencies come from a sense of safety and have a sense of habit and ritual to it, which is a combination of Virgo and Scorpio’s energy. Pisces is, yes, Pisces joy is also dreams; those are the illusions.”
The Difference:
                                                                                                                        * Cancer/Moon = subconscious (patterns, habits, emotional conditioning below awareness)
                                                                                                                        * Pisces/Neptune = unconscious (completely unknown, dreamstate, before consciousness)

Dreams and Sleep
Direct Quote:
“That’s where we get, when you get into Scorpio’s energy is when you get into your REM sleep, your deep sleep, which leads us into our dream state. If you don’t hit that REM, you don’t get those dreams.”
Sleep Stages:
                                                                                                                        * Cancer = sleep itself (rest, subconscious state)
                                                                                                                        * Scorpio = REM sleep (deep, fixed state)
                                                                                                                        * Pisces = dreams (unconscious imagery, illusions)

Death and Endings
Direct Quote:
“Dissolution, loss, things that are going away, things that are ending, like actual endings, which is interesting to think of Capricorn being the death point. And there’s a sextile from— because there’s an element of death we don’t fully understand— but there’s a sextile from death to Pisces energy, which means, is it actually the ending point? Like, cyclically speaking, is it the true ending point? Is death the actual ending point? No, you can come back.”
Death in the Zodiac:
                                                                                                                        * Capricorn = death (the end, finish line)
                                                                                                                        * Pisces = after death (what comes next, the unknown)
                                                                                                                        * Aquarius = cheating death (revival)
                                                                                                                        * Scorpio = way of dying (decay, transformation)
The Sextile from Capricorn to Pisces:
Direct Quote:
“You could be revived through electricity, like through resuscitation, which is that Aquarian energy, which is why people can cheat death, even though Capricorn rules it. Once you’ve hit the ending, though, you are dead; like, you can’t be at the ending point. So you can have these near-death experiences, and you can have these spiritual awakenings and whatnot with it, but then you can cycle through. So it’s an interesting concept there. In order to have it, you have to actually die, which is crazy to think of.”

                                                                                                                        * Near-death experiences = touching Pisces (unknown) without fully dying (Capricorn)

Burnout vs Depression
Direct Quote:
“Burnout is a combination of things, but remember Capricorn is the exhaustion. To get out of burnout, you would have to take the oppositional point and feed it in, which is rest: Cancer. Cancer is rest, sleep.”
The Difference:
                                                                                                                        * Depression = Pisces (illusion of lost vitality)

                                                                                                                        * Burnout = Capricorn (actual exhaustion)
                                                                                                                        * Cure: Cancer (rest, sleep, emotional nurturing)

Lucid Dreams
From Q&A:
Direct Quote:
“Lucid dreams is really a combination of energies that are bringing a sense of reality into the scope of how Neptune, how Pisces, and how the 12th house sits in your chart. When you start identifying an energy as something, like lucid dreams is not dreams, it’s lucid dreams. You’re putting an adjective to them. As soon as you start adding adjectives, you’re adding other energies in because you’re quantifying that dream.”

🎓 CONCLUDING REMARKS & Q&A INSIGHTS
The 12th-6th Axis: Personal vs Outer World
Direct Quote:
“The split of the axis goes from the 12th house to the end of the fifth house, beginning of the 12th, end of the fifth. So your axis between personal and not personal is actually tilted; it is not the ascendant, descendant; it’s not the first seventh; it is the 12th sixth, technically. The sixth starts the outer world; the 12th starts the inner world.”
Critical Teaching:
                                                                                                                        * Traditional: 1st-7th axis = self vs other
                                                                                                                        * Alchemistic: 12th-6th axis = inner vs outer world
                                                                                                                        * 12th house = inner world (before you, subconscious, hidden)
                                                                                                                        * 6th house = outer world starts (work, service, daily interaction)

Individuality vs Service: The Balance
Direct Quote:
“And if our everything was connection to everybody in a way where we had no separation of ourselves versus other people, there would literally be no point in living So, while I believe that service to others and connecting to others is a huge, vital, integral part of what we’re supposed to do, it’s also supposed to be being ourselves and doing things for our own motivations that will be received in some way, not for them, but in a way where we can discuss it.”
The Philosophy:
                                                                                                                        * NOT all about service (that’s spiritual bypassing)
                                                                                                                        * NOT all about self (that cuts off purpose)
                                                                                                                        * BOTH: Individual motivation + connection/service
                                                                                                                        * Why: Personal chart = unique expression; must honor self AND connect
Direct Quote:
“If we say, I’m gonna do it my own way and do it for me, and I don’t care about you, well, you’re cutting out a lot of the chart, means you’re gonna be out of alignment and there’s gonna be no purpose for the thing that you’re doing. You’re not gonna be able to sell it, you’re not gonna be able to talk about it, nobody’s gonna care. You’re literally cutting out the motive, and then you’re going to lose motivation because nothing’s cycling back in to keep the thing going.”
Practical Application:
                                                                                                                        * Do things for YOUR motivations (Aries, Leo, personal planets)
                                                                                                                        * But connect/share (Libra, Aquarius, Pisces, interpersonal planets)
                                                                                                                        * Both required for sustained motivation and purpose

Mini Gods: Individuality Within Connection
Direct Quote:
“I talk all the time about how we are mini gods, right? Some people hate that term and I don’t know what to tell them You can believe whatever you wanna believe, but if you’re on this journey, the way that we can teach it, Ashley and I, is we believe that we’re all mini gods. Most people understand or have a similar belief that we’re all connected through a source, but it doesn’t mean that we are all the same. And I think this is where I deviate so hard from the spiritual community.”
The Distinction:
                                                                                                                        * New age: We’re all one, serve everyone, no separation
                                                                                                                        * Alchemistic: We’re all connected BUT unique individuals
                                                                                                                        * Chart purpose: Shows your UNIQUE expression within the whole
                                                                                                                        * Why charts matter: If we were all the same, why have individual charts?
Direct Quote:
“What would be the point of having a natal chart? What would be the point of being different from another person? And what would be the point of having a sun or an Aries? These are all very personal things.”

FREE Theory and Lucid Dreams (Descriptor Example)
Direct Quote:
“Lucid dreams is really a combination of energies that are bringing a sense of reality into the scope of how Neptune, how Pisces, and how the 12th house sits in your chart. When you start identifying an energy as something, like lucid dreams is not dreams, it’s lucid dreams. You’re putting an adjective to them. As soon as you start adding adjectives, you’re adding other energies in because you’re quantifying that dream.”
The Principle:
                                                                                                                        * Pisces = dreams (base energy)
                                                                                                                        * “Lucid” = qualifier (adds another energy)
                                                                                                                        * Any descriptor = additional aspect/planet
                                                                                                                        * FREE theory = base themes, not every specific variation
Application:
                                                                                                                        * When something has multiple qualities, check for multiple aspects
                                                                                                                        * Descriptors point to combined energies
                                                                                                                        * Base keyword = primary planet/sign; modifiers = aspects

FREE Theory Purpose
Direct Quote:
“So free theory and the thematic expression of each one of these energies is not about a specific; it is about the theme itself in general, so that when we see it in the chart, we can say, oh, you have lucid dreams. Oh, you have messed up dreams.”
What FREE Theory Does:
                                                                                                                        * Provides base themes (foundation of each sign)
                                                                                                                        * Proves what signs MUST mean (via aspectual relationships)
                                                                                                                        * Shows energy flow (directional, based on 180° Rule)
                                                                                                                        * Enables precise identification (this IS Scorpio, NOT Pluto, etc.)
What FREE Theory Does NOT Do:
                                                                                                                        * Describe every specific manifestation (that’s where aspects come in)
                                                                                                                        * Replace aspect analysis (it’s the foundation FOR aspect work)

Example Entry: Aries-Taurus Semi-Sextile:
Aspect: Semi-sextile (30°)
Relationship: Supportive, Simultaneous Collaboration Required
Description: "Aries (action) needs to understand Taurus (value/resources) or feels blocked. Action without value = wasted energy."
Example: "Working hard but not making money = Aries acting without Taurus understanding."
Proof: "This is WHY people can work hard and stay poor—they're exerting energy (Aries) without directing it toward value (Taurus)."

Feature 3: Energy vs Definition Mode
Purpose:
Train users to think in terms of ENERGY (how it manifests) rather than fixed definitions (what it "means").
Toggle Feature:
Definition Mode (Traditional): "Mars means aggression and war."
Energy Mode (Alchemistic): "Mars is action energy. How does it manifest? Through drive, assertion, movement, pioneering. In low vibration: aggression, conflict. In high vibration: courage, leadership."
Implementation:
                                                                                                                        * Toggle switch in settings: "Show Definitions" vs "Show Energy"
                                                                                                                        * Energy mode uses dynamic language: "manifests as," "expresses through," "flows into"
                                                                                                                        * Definition mode uses static language: "means," "represents," "is"
                                                                                                                        * Encourage users to default to Energy mode

                                                                                                                        * Practical interpretation
                                                                                                                        * Resolution method
Example Output:
Aries (1st) → Cancer (4th)
Aspect: Square (90°)
Flow: Aries sends → Cancer receives
Planet 1: Aries (the problem)
Planet 2: Cancer (the solution)


Relationship: "Conflict Point Requiring Symbiosis"


Interpretation: "Action (Aries) requires emotional safety (Cancer). Without feeling safe, action leads to trouble or harm. Cancer is the solution—when you feel secure, action becomes productive."


Resolution: "Ensure emotional foundation before taking action. Build safety structures that enable risk-taking."

________________


1. INTRODUCTION & PHILOSOPHICAL FRAMEWORK
1.1 Building on Previous Teachings
Direct Quote:
“This is part of the reason that I really wanted to have these webinars for those in you that are already in the Uber and experienced, because we’ve already discussed certain foundations where people that are brand new are like, ‘Wait, what?’ And we would literally have to like take several steps back in order to get those foundations present. So with this particular series, we’re able to do things that I find are a little bit more advanced and I’m able to speak faster without having to over explain certain things that we’ve already discussed.”
Context: Transcript 15 represents an advanced mechanics class designed for students who have already absorbed:
                                                                                                                        * The dual wheel chart structure (inner wheel = houses; outer wheel = signs)
                                                                                                                        * Natural rulership and bidirectional energy flow
                                                                                                                        * PHSR interpretation method (Planet-House-Sign-Ruler)
                                                                                                                        * Basic understanding that houses are the CORE of interpretation
Pedagogical Positioning:
 The instructor explicitly acknowledges this material requires prior foundation. This is NOT an introductory class—it’s building sophisticated technical mechanisms on top of already-established philosophical principles.
Key Prerequisite Concepts Referenced:
                                                                                                                        1. Inner vs Outer Wheel - Discussed thoroughly in Transcript 8 (Uber Newbie Basics)
                                                                                                                        2. Natural Rulership - Each planet has a “natural” sign it rules
                                                                                                                        3. Bidirectional Energy - Rulership creates two-way energy flow
                                                                                                                        4. Houses as Priority - The field (house) matters more than the tone (sign)
________________


1.2 What Are “True Placements”?
Direct Quote:
“So what we’re really discussing when we’re talking about true placements is mechanically understanding this inner and outer wheel, this dual system that we have talked about before. And what we’re going to be doing is taking each part of those and individually pulling them through so that they can stand alone. And I hope to remind you of why the inner wheel, the house is the core of everything.”
Defining True Placements:
True Placements is NOT a single technique—it’s a comprehensive framework for understanding how EVERY energy in the chart operates through the dual wheel mechanism.
Core Principle:
 Most astrology collapses the dual wheel into a single layer by treating “Sun in Leo in the 10th house” as one unified placement. Alchemistic Astrology separates these layers to understand:
                                                                                                                        * What the planet IS (Sun = vitality focus)
                                                                                                                        * Where it OPERATES (10th house = career/public field)
                                                                                                                        * How it EXPRESSES (Leo = vital creative tone)
                                                                                                                        * Where it PULLS FROM (its Base = the house ruled by Leo)
                                                                                                                        * How it ENTERS (its Spark = degree-based first engagement)
Why “True” Placements?
Direct Quote:
“Most astrology is actually telling you what your sign placements are. And I’ve been very, very vocal about the fact that your sign doesn’t mean anything. That’s a tone. That’s a membrane. If anything, what matters is the energetic field, which is the house, right? So we really want to separate those two so that we can understand the chart from a very different perspective.”
The term “True” emphasizes:
                                                                                                                        1. Astronomical accuracy - Based on actual celestial mechanics, not symbolic assignments
                                                                                                                        2. Hierarchy of importance - Houses (Earth’s rotation) are physically more connected to YOU than signs (ecliptic/universe)
                                                                                                                        3. Functional reality - How the energy actually WORKS vs how it’s traditionally described

1.3 Scope: The 10 Ruling Planets
Direct Quote:
“And the reason I bring that up is because True Placements, they apply to every single energy in the chart. However, what we’re going to do from a like informational perspective is we’re only going to be talking about the 10 planets, not any like asteroids or Chiron or Black Moon Lilith or any of those things, because we’re going to be looking at rulers. We’re going to be talking about rulers.”
Technical Limitation:
True Placements analysis focuses on the 10 ruling planets:
                                                                                                                        1. Sun (rules Leo)
                                                                                                                        2. Moon (rules Cancer)
                                                                                                                        3. Mercury (rules Gemini and Virgo)
                                                                                                                        4. Venus (rules Taurus and Libra)
                                                                                                                        5. Mars (rules Aries and Scorpio - see note below)
                                                                                                                        6. Jupiter (rules Sagittarius and Pisces)
                                                                                                                        7. Saturn (rules Capricorn and Aquarius)
                                                                                                                        8. Uranus (co-rules Aquarius)
                                                                                                                        9. Neptune (co-rules Pisces)
                                                                                                                        10. Pluto (co-rules Scorpio)
Why This Limitation?
Direct Quote:
“You can’t get a base outside of the 10 ruling planets. I can’t give you a base for Chiron because Chiron doesn’t rule a sign. I can’t give you a base for Black Moon Lilith because it doesn’t rule a sign. I can’t give you a base for Ceres because, you know, it doesn’t rule a sign.”
The Base concept (covered in Section 4) requires a planet to RULE a sign. Since asteroids, Chiron, Black Moon Lilith, and other points don’t have traditional rulerships in the system, they cannot have Bases calculated.
Important Rulership Note:
Direct Quote:
“We’re also not going to be getting into the argument about traditional versus modern rulers. My perspective on that is Mars rules both Aries and Scorpio. Saturn rules both Capricorn and Aquarius. Jupiter rules both Sagittarius and Pisces. And I do believe that Uranus, Neptune and Pluto have influence on their respected signs. However, I’ve talked about this before, the only aspect to Uranus, Neptune and Pluto that is a Ptolemaic aspect—meaning that it’s actually like real aspects and not like sassy aspects—is the conjunction. So you can only really conjunct these signs as an outer planet. You can’t really rule them.”
Alchemistic Astrology Rulership System:
                                                                                                                        * Primary Rulers: Traditional rulers maintained (Mars/Aries-Scorpio, Jupiter/Sagittarius-Pisces, Saturn/Capricorn-Aquarius)
                                                                                                                        * Outer Planet Influence: Uranus, Neptune, Pluto have INFLUENCE through conjunction but are NOT primary rulers
                                                                                                                        * Practical Implication: When calculating Base (Section 4), use traditional rulers; outer planet influence is acknowledged but doesn’t replace foundational rulership

2. THE DUAL WHEEL SYSTEM: CORE VS FIELD
2.1 Review: Inner Wheel (Houses) vs Outer Wheel (Signs)
Direct Quote:
“So when we talk about the dual wheel, what do we mean by that? Well, we have this inner wheel, which is the house. This is going to be created by the earth’s rotation. This is the core. And then we have an outer wheel, which is the sign, which is going to be created by the universe, which is the ecliptic, and this is the field that we’re going to move through.”
Scientific Foundation:
The dual wheel is NOT arbitrary, it’s based on two distinct astronomical phenomena:
Inner Wheel (Houses):
                                                                                                                        * Created By: Earth’s rotation on its axis (24-hour cycle)
                                                                                                                        * Represents: Core energy fields emanating from Earth
                                                                                                                        * Connection to YOU: Direct—you are an extension of Earth’s energy
                                                                                                                        * Function: Defines the FIELD/AREA of life where energy operates
                                                                                                                        * Priority: PRIMARY (most important in interpretation)
Outer Wheel (Signs):
                                                                                                                        * Created By: Earth’s orbit around the Sun / the ecliptic (365-day cycle)
                                                                                                                        * Represents: Universal membrane/filter through which you experience reality
                                                                                                                        * Connection to YOU: Indirect—you observe the universe through Earth’s position
                                                                                                                        * Function: Provides the TONE/EXPRESSION of how energy manifests
                                                                                                                        * Priority: SECONDARY (modifies but doesn’t define core energy)

2.2 Why Houses Are the Core
Direct Quote:
“The inner wheel, the houses that are created from the earth’s rotation, this is the core. Meaning that this is our most intimate relationship with energy. Why? Because you are an extension of the earth. You are literally born of this earth. The outer wheel, the signs, is the tone. It is the field through which we move. It is the membrane. It is the veil.”
Metaphysical Justification:
The instructor provides a philosophical AND physical argument for house priority:
Physical Argument:
                                                                                                                        1. You are born ON Earth
                                                                                                                        2. Your body is made FROM Earth’s elements
                                                                                                                        3. Earth’s rotation creates the house divisions
                                                                                                                        4. Houses are therefore YOUR energy fields
Experiential Argument:
 Signs represent the UNIVERSE—the vast ecliptic circle through which Earth moves. You don’t directly experience the universe; you experience EARTH’S RELATIONSHIP to the universe.
Analogy:
                                                                                                                        * Houses = The rooms in your home (where you live and operate)
                                                                                                                        * Signs = The neighborhood/city around your home (the broader context you experience through your windows)
You don’t live IN the neighborhood; you live in your house WITHIN the neighborhood. The house is your immediate reality; the neighborhood colors your experience.

2.3 The Fundamental Error in Most Astrology
Direct Quote:
“Most astrology is actually telling you what your sign placements are. And I’ve been very, very vocal about the fact that your sign doesn’t mean anything. That’s a tone. That’s a membrane. If anything, what matters is the energetic field, which is the house, right?”
Critical Distinction:
Traditional astrology says: “You have Sun in Leo”
                                                                                                                        * This emphasizes the SIGN (tone/expression)
                                                                                                                        * The house is mentioned secondarily or ignored
Alchemistic Astrology says: “You have Sun in the 10th house, colored by Leo”
                                                                                                                        * This emphasizes the HOUSE (field/area of life)
                                                                                                                        * The sign is acknowledged as a modifier
Why This Matters:
Direct Quote:
“So we really want to separate those two so that we can understand the chart from a very different perspective. And within True Placements, what we’re doing is we’re allowing all of these energies to stand alone. We’re giving them—each one of them their own value, their own stance, their own place to be able to express.”
When you collapse house and sign into “Sun in Leo in 10th,” you:
                                                                                                                        1. Lose the ability to see how house FIELD operates independently
                                                                                                                        2. Miss the bidirectional energy flow from the planet’s RULER
                                                                                                                        3. Cannot calculate the BASE (Section 4)
                                                                                                                        4. Cannot understand the SPARK (Section 5)
True Placements separates these layers so each can be analyzed for its unique contribution to the energy’s expression.

3. TRUE PLACEMENTS METHODOLOGY
3.1 The Reading Sequence
Direct Quote:
“So when we’re reading a placement, we’re going to be reading: Planet, Spark—which is the first thing, actually Planet in Field rather, the house that we’re talking about. First thing, the planet becomes the focus. The way that it enters is the spark. The next stage, literally the next way you dive into that energy is the pulse, which is the decan, which we’re not talking about today. Then you have the tone, which is the sign. Then you have the field, which is the house, which is like the house that we’re reading that the planet is in. And then we have the base.”
Complete Reading Order:
                                                                                                                        1. PLANET = Focus (What is the energy about?)
                                                                                                                        2. SPARK = First Engagement (How do you enter this energy? Degree-based)
                                                                                                                        3. PULSE = Next Entry Point (Decan—not covered in Transcript 15)
                                                                                                                        4. TONE = Expression (What is the flavor/membrane?)
                                                                                                                        5. FIELD = Core Area (Which life area does this operate in? MOST IMPORTANT)
                                                                                                                        6. BASE = Bidirectional Source (Where does this energy pull from?)
Important Note on Order:
The instructor clarifies there’s a logical sequence vs presentation sequence:

“So the way I’m listing it, Planet, Spark, Pulse, Tone, Field, Base, that’s like a natural flow of how things work. However, when you’re reading, the house is first. The house is the field. That’s what I always say. That’s the most important part. But within that, how I naturally go through the energy is in that order.”
Practical Reading Approach:
Step 1: Identify the HOUSE (field)—this is your anchor
Step 2: Note the PLANET (focus)—what is operating in this field?
Step 3: Check the SPARK (degree)—how does it enter?
Step 4: Observe the PULSE (decan)—second engagement layer [not covered here]
Step 5: Acknowledge the TONE (sign)—what flavor does it have?
Step 6: Calculate the BASE (rulership)—where is it pulling from?
This creates a layered, multi-dimensional understanding instead of the flat “Sun in Leo in 10th” statement.

3.2 Why Sign “Doesn’t Mean Anything”
Direct Quote:
“This is why I laugh about it all the time: people want to do sign zodiac or they want to do planet zodiac. Sign doesn’t mean anything.”
Clarification:
The instructor is NOT saying signs are useless—she’s saying they are not the primary defining factor.
The Hierarchy:
                                                                                                                        1. HOUSE (field) = Defines WHERE the energy operates (most important)
                                                                                                                        2. PLANET (focus) = Defines WHAT the energy is about
                                                                                                                        3. RULER (base) = Defines where it PULLS FROM (bidirectional connection)
                                                                                                                        4. SIGN (tone) = Colors HOW it expresses (least important for core meaning)
Analogy:
If you’re painting a room:
                                                                                                                        * House = Which room you’re painting (bedroom vs kitchen)
                                                                                                                        * Planet = What you’re painting (walls vs ceiling)
                                                                                                                        * Ruler/Base = Where you’re getting your supplies from
                                                                                                                        * Sign = What color you’re using
The color (sign) matters for aesthetics, but it doesn’t change the FACT that you’re painting the bedroom walls. You wouldn’t describe your project as “I’m doing a blue project”—you’d say “I’m painting my bedroom blue.”
Similarly, you don’t have a “Leo sun”—you have a Sun in the 10th house that expresses through Leo.

3.3 Separating the Layers
Direct Quote:
“So we really want to separate those two so that we can understand the chart from a very different perspective. And within True Placements, what we’re doing is we’re allowing all of these energies to stand alone. We’re giving them—each one of them their own value, their own stance, their own place to be able to express.”
Technical Implementation:
In a traditional astrology app, you might display:
Sun: Leo, 10th House


In an Alchemistic Astrology app using True Placements, you would display:
SUN (Vitality Focus)
├─ Field: 10th House (Career, Public Life, Reputation)
├─ Tone: Leo (Vital, Creative, Expressive)
├─ Base: [Calculated from Leo's house position]
├─ Spark: [Calculated from exact degree]
└─ Pulse: [Decan information]


Each layer gets its own SPACE to be understood independently, then synthesized.
Why This Approach?
Direct Quote:
“And the reason I bring that up is because True Placements, they apply to every single energy in the chart.”
By separating layers:
                                                                                                                        1. You can see patterns ACROSS placements (e.g., multiple planets with 5th house bases)
                                                                                                                        2. You can understand energy flow more clearly (Base → Planet → Field → Expression)
                                                                                                                        3. You avoid the reductionist trap of “Sun in Leo” meaning one fixed thing
                                                                                                                        4. You honor the complexity of how energies actually interact

4. BASE CONCEPT: BIDIRECTIONAL RULERSHIP ENERGY
4.1 Definition and Core Concept
Direct Quote:
“So a base is the bidirectional energy that we are pulling from. And what we’re doing is we’re finding that through the ruler. So whatever planet we’re talking about, we’re going to figure out what sign that planet rules, and then we’re going to find the house that that sign is in. And that becomes our base.”
Simple Definition:
BASE = The house position of the sign that your planet rules
Conceptual Framework:
Every planet rules a sign (or signs). That ruling relationship creates a bidirectional energy channel:
                                                                                                                        1. The planet SENDS energy to its ruled sign
                                                                                                                        2. The planet PULLS energy from wherever its ruled sign is located (by house)
The house where the ruled sign sits becomes the BASE—the foundational energy source that the planet draws from.

4.2 Calculation Method
Direct Quote:
“So whatever planet we’re talking about, we’re going to figure out what sign that planet rules, and then we’re going to find the house that that sign is in. And that becomes our base.”
Step-by-Step Algorithm:
STEP 1: Identify the planet you’re analyzing
STEP 2: Determine which sign(s) that planet rules
STEP 3: Locate that sign in the chart (which house does it govern?)
STEP 4: That house number = the planet’s BASE
Rulership Reference Table:
Planet
	Rules Sign(s)
	Sun
	Leo
	Moon
	Cancer
	Mercury
	Gemini & Virgo
	Venus
	Taurus & Libra
	Mars
	Aries & Scorpio
	Jupiter
	Sagittarius & Pisces
	Saturn
	Capricorn & Aquarius
	Uranus
	Aquarius (co-ruler)
	Neptune
	Pisces (co-ruler)
	Pluto
	Scorpio (co-ruler)
	Important for Dual-Ruled Planets:
Direct Quote:
“When you have a planet like Mercury or Venus or Mars or Jupiter or Saturn, they all rule two signs. So for any of those planets, you actually have two bases. And how do you decide which one to be pulling from? That’s something you have to determine. Like you have to look at your own chart and be like, ‘Which one makes more sense for me?’ You get to make that choice.”
Technical Note:
                                                                                                                        * Mercury has TWO bases (one from Gemini’s house, one from Virgo’s house)
                                                                                                                        * Venus has TWO bases (one from Taurus’s house, one from Libra’s house)
                                                                                                                        * Mars has TWO bases (one from Aries’s house, one from Scorpio’s house)
                                                                                                                        * Jupiter has TWO bases (one from Sagittarius’s house, one from Pisces’s house)
                                                                                                                        * Saturn has TWO bases (one from Capricorn’s house, one from Aquarius’s house)
The native must discern through experiential investigation which base resonates more strongly, though both are technically valid.

4.3 Elvis Presley Example: Sun Base
Context: The instructor uses Elvis Presley’s chart throughout this class.
Direct Quote:
“So in Elvis’ case, his sun is in Capricorn in the sixth house. That’s his placement. His base for his sun is going to be determined by Leo. So where is Leo in his chart? Leo is on the cusp of his ninth house. So we’re going to say, okay, his sun in Capricorn in the six, his base is Sagittarius—or sorry, his base is the ninth house.”
Elvis’s Sun Analysis:
Sun Placement:
                                                                                                                        * Sign: Capricorn
                                                                                                                        * House: 6th house
                                                                                                                        * Interpretation: Vitality focus operates in daily work/health field, expressed through structured Capricorn tone
Sun Base Calculation:
                                                                                                                        1. Sun rules Leo
                                                                                                                        2. Leo is located on the 9th house cusp in Elvis’s chart
                                                                                                                        3. Therefore: Sun’s BASE = 9th house
What This Means:
Elvis’s vitality (Sun) operates in the 6th house field (daily work, routine, health), BUT it pulls its foundational energy from the 9th house (higher learning, expansion, performance, teaching, foreign cultures).
Interpretation:
Direct Quote:
“So what we’re saying here is that even though his vitality focus is in his daily work, right, like his sun is in the sixth house, he’s working with his vitality in a very physical way, in a very daily way, the base of that, where he’s pulling from is this ninth house energy, which is the higher learning, the performance. You know, Elvis was an incredible performer. That’s like his thing. That’s like, I mean, and he literally got his spark there. That’s what we’re going to get into.”
Practical Application:
Elvis didn’t just work (6th house)—he worked as a performer (9th house base). His daily routine (6th) was infused with performance energy, higher consciousness, and reaching broad audiences (9th).
The BASE shows where the energy originates before it expresses through the planet’s house position.

4.4 Elvis Presley Example: Moon Base
Direct Quote:
“His moon is in Pisces in the eighth house. So we’re going to find his base for the moon. The moon rules Cancer, which is on the cusp of his twelfth house. So his moon in Pisces in the eight, his base is the twelfth house.”
Elvis’s Moon Analysis:
Moon Placement:
                                                                                                                        * Sign: Pisces
                                                                                                                        * House: 8th house
                                                                                                                        * Interpretation: Emotional needs/safety focus operates in transformation/depth field, expressed through dissolvable Pisces tone
Moon Base Calculation:
                                                                                                                        1. Moon rules Cancer
                                                                                                                        2. Cancer is located on the 12th house cusp in Elvis’s chart
                                                                                                                        3. Therefore: Moon’s BASE = 12th house
What This Means:
Direct Quote:
“What we’re looking at here is we have his emotional need for safety, the moon, within this transformative, shared resource kind of experience, the eighth house, and it’s in Pisces. So it’s very dissolvable, very escapism. The base of that is the twelfth house, which is where we lose sense of self. We transcend the ego. We are able to escape. There is a massive amount of isolation. There’s like a seclusion from the rest of the world.”
Interpretation:
Elvis’s emotional world (Moon) operated through:
                                                                                                                        1. 8th house placement = Deep transformation, intensity, shared resources, sexuality, death/rebirth themes
                                                                                                                        2. Pisces tone = Dissolving boundaries, escapism, sensitivity, mysticism
                                                                                                                        3. 12th house base = Pulling from isolation, transcendence, loss of self, hidden realms
Practical Application:
This configuration reveals why Elvis struggled with:
                                                                                                                        * Substance use (12th house base → 8th house transformation → Pisces dissolution)
                                                                                                                        * Isolation despite fame (12th house base feeding emotional needs)
                                                                                                                        * Difficulty maintaining boundaries (Pisces + 12th house + 8th house combo)
                                                                                                                        * Deep spiritual/mystical interests (12th house feeding into emotional world)
The BASE shows that his emotional security needs were ROOTED in 12th house themes, which then expressed through the 8th house transformation field.

4.5 Base vs. House Placement: The Critical Difference
Direct Quote:
“And I know that I just said, you know, the sun is in the sixth house. So why are we talking about two different things? Because the sun in the sixth house is where his vitality focus is operating. The base of his sun, the ninth house, is where he’s pulling that energy from.”
Conceptual Distinction:
House Placement (Field):
                                                                                                                        * WHERE the planet operates
                                                                                                                        * The AREA OF LIFE it affects
                                                                                                                        * The experiential domain

                                                                                                                        * The ENERGETIC FOUNDATION
                                                                                                                        * The bidirectional rulership channel

                                                                                                                        * House Placement = Where the fountain sits in your garden (which area it beautifies)
                                                                                                                        * Base = Where the water pipes connect (where the water actually comes from)
The fountain operates in one location (house) but draws its water from a different source (base).

4.6 Focus vs. Field Distinction
Direct Quote:
“So for example, if somebody has Mars in cancer in the twelfth house, their focus, the planet, is going to be action, determination, how they move forward, right? That’s Mars energy. The field is going to be the twelfth house. That’s where they’re operating. But where they’re pulling from is going to be determined by their base.”
The Framework:
FOCUS (Planet) = WHAT the energy is
FIELD (House) = WHERE the energy operates
SOURCE (Base) = WHERE the energy pulls from
TONE (Sign) = HOW the energy expresses
Example: Mars in Cancer in 12th House
Focus (Mars): Action, determination, drive, assertion
Field (12th): Isolation, transcendence, hidden realms, subconscious
Tone (Cancer): Protective, emotional, nurturing, defensive
Base Calculation:
                                                                                                                        1. Mars rules Aries (and Scorpio)
                                                                                                                        2. Find Aries in the chart → Let’s say it’s in the 3rd house
                                                                                                                        3. Mars’s BASE = 3rd house
Interpretation:
 This person’s action (Mars focus) operates in hidden/isolated ways (12th house field) with protective emotional responses (Cancer tone), BUT it draws its foundational energy from communication, learning, and immediate environment (3rd house base).
Practical Meaning:
 They might take action (Mars) in hidden ways (12th), but the DRIVE to act comes from intellectual stimulation, sibling dynamics, or communication needs (3rd house base). They’re not just randomly acting from isolation—they’re acting from isolation BECAUSE of something in their learning/communication world.

4.7 Why Base Matters: The Bidirectional Energy Flow
Direct Quote:
“So a base is the bidirectional energy that we are pulling from.”
Bidirectional Energy Explained:
Traditional Astrology View:
 Planet → Sign (one-way relationship)
“Mars in Aries means assertive action”
Alchemistic Astrology View:
 Planet ↔ Ruled Sign ↔ House of Ruled Sign (two-way relationship)
“Mars rules Aries → wherever Aries is in your chart creates an energy channel → Mars draws from that house”
Why This Matters:
Direct Quote from Transcript 8 (Bidirectional Rulership):
“When we’re talking about rulership, we’re talking about a bidirectional relationship. It’s not just that the planet rules the sign; the sign also influences the planet through the house it governs.”
The BASE concept operationalizes this bidirectional theory:
                                                                                                                        1. Sending Energy: Sun sends vitality energy TO Leo (wherever Leo appears in transits, other charts, etc.)
                                                                                                                        2. Receiving Energy: Sun receives foundational energy FROM the house Leo governs in YOUR natal chart
Practical Impact:
If your Sun’s base is the 5th house (Leo on 5th cusp), your vitality is constantly pulling from and influenced by 5th house themes:
                                                                                                                        * Creative expression
                                                                                                                        * Children/childhood
                                                                                                                        * Play and recreation
                                                                                                                        * Romance and pleasure
                                                                                                                        * Authentic self-expression
Even if your Sun is in the 11th house (groups, future goals), it’s rooted in 5th house energy. You might pursue future visions (11th) but do so with creative, playful, child-like enthusiasm (5th base).

4.8 Base Cannot Exist for Non-Ruling Bodies
Direct Quote:
“You can’t get a base outside of the 10 ruling planets. I can’t give you a base for Chiron because Chiron doesn’t rule a sign. I can’t give you a base for Black Moon Lilith because it doesn’t rule a sign. I can’t give you a base for Ceres because, you know, it doesn’t rule a sign.”
Technical Limitation:
The BASE calculation requires:
                                                                                                                        1. A planet
                                                                                                                        2. That planet RULES a sign
                                                                                                                        3. That sign appears somewhere in the chart
                                                                                                                        4. The house where that sign appears = BASE
Non-Ruling Bodies:
                                                                                                                        * Chiron - Does not rule a sign (no base)
                                                                                                                        * Black Moon Lilith - Does not rule a sign (no base)
                                                                                                                        * Ceres, Pallas, Juno, Vesta (asteroids) - Do not rule signs (no base)
                                                                                                                        * North Node/South Node - Not planets, don’t rule signs (no base)
                                                                                                                        * Part of Fortune - Calculated point, doesn’t rule a sign (no base)
Why This Makes Sense:
The Base is about bidirectional rulership energy. If a point doesn’t RULE anything, there’s no rulership channel to trace backward to find a base.
App Development Note:
 Base calculations should ONLY be offered for the 10 ruling planets. Attempting to calculate base for other points should return an error message: “Base calculation only applies to the 10 ruling planets (Sun through Pluto).”

5. SPARK CONCEPT: FIRST ENGAGEMENT THROUGH DEGREE THEORY
5.1 Definition and Core Concept
Direct Quote:
“The spark is your first engagement within the energy. So what we’re doing is we’re looking at the degree that the planet is in. And I know that there’s a lot of like degree theory out there and specifically like Nicholas’s work where he’s taken the 360 degrees and essentially assigned them by like sign, right? So zero degrees is assigned to Aries and one degrees assigned to Taurus.”
Simple Definition:
SPARK = The first way you engage with a planetary energy, determined by the exact DEGREE the planet occupies
Why “Spark”?
The term “spark” suggests:
                                                                                                                        * Initial ignition
                                                                                                                        * First contact point
                                                                                                                        * Entry mechanism
                                                                                                                        * How the energy “lights up” when activated
It’s the DOORWAY through which you enter the planet’s energy before you experience the full tone (sign) and field (house).

5.2 Problems with Nicholas’s Degree Theory
Direct Quote:
“And the reason why I find issue with that is because celestially that doesn’t make sense. So essentially what he’s doing is saying that as we move from Aries, he’s putting Aries at one degree, he’s putting Taurus at two degree, he’s putting Gemini at three degree, which would make sense as we’re going through a sign, right? But then as soon as you hit a new sign, it starts over. It resets back at Aries. And there’s nothing celestially that resets.”
The Flawed System:
Nicholas’s degree theory (popular in some astrology circles) assigns:
                                                                                                                        * 0° = Aries
                                                                                                                        * 1° = Taurus
                                                                                                                        * 2° = Gemini
                                                                                                                        * 3° = Cancer
                                                                                                                        * [etc., cycling through all 12 signs]
                                                                                                                        * 12° = Aries (starts over)
                                                                                                                        * 13° = Taurus
                                                                                                                        * [repeats for 360°]
Critical Flaw:
Direct Quote:
“And there’s nothing celestially that resets. So I don’t understand the reasoning behind that. And if someone has a reasoning behind that, great. It’s just not my perspective. So I wanted to give you what I think is a little bit more aligned with celestial mechanics.”
Why It’s Problematic:
                                                                                                                        1. No Astronomical Basis: Nothing in the sky “resets” every 12 degrees
                                                                                                                        2. Arbitrary Assignment: Why would 1° = Taurus when Taurus is 30-60° along the ecliptic?
                                                                                                                        3. Ignores Perpetual Motion: The ecliptic is a continuous circle; degrees don’t restart
                                                                                                                        4. Contradicts Natural Progression: Signs naturally follow each other; degrees should too
The instructor rejects this system in favor of one based on actual celestial mechanics.

5.3 Alchemistic Astrology Spark System
Direct Quote:
“What I have found to be more aligned is that when you are in an odd sign, so Aries, Gemini, Leo, Libra, Sagittarius, Aquarius, zero degrees is Aries. But as you’re moving through that odd sign, you are perpetually moving through the zodiac. So you start at Aries at zero degrees, and then as you go to one degree, you move into Taurus, and then you move through the zodiac from there.”
Core Mechanic:
The Spark system uses perpetual zodiacal progression based on whether the planet is in an ODD or EVEN sign.
Foundation:
                                                                                                                        * Each degree represents ONE sign in zodiacal order
                                                                                                                        * The starting point depends on sign polarity (odd vs even)
                                                                                                                        * No resetting—continuous progression through the zodiac

“So if you’re at 11 degrees in an even sign, you start with Libra. So you’re at Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius, Pisces, Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo. So 11 in an even sign is Virgo.”
11 degrees in even sign:
                                                                                                                        * Start at 0° = Libra
                                                                                                                        * Count forward 11 steps: Libra→Scorpio→Sagittarius→Capricorn→Aquarius→Pisces→Aries→Taurus→Gemini→Cancer→Leo→Virgo
                                                                                                                        * Spark = Virgo

5.6 Mathematical Shortcut: Modular Arithmetic
Direct Quote:
“So if you want to math this, what you can do is you can take the degree number, divide it by 12, and the remainder is where you are within the zodiac. So if you’re in an odd sign and you’re at like 19 degrees, you divide 19 by 12, the remainder is 7. That means that seven degrees forward from Aries, which would be Scorpio.”
Formula for Fast Calculation:
Step 1: Take the degree number
Step 2: Divide by 12
Step 3: Note the REMAINDER
Step 4: Count that many signs forward from your starting point
For Odd Signs (start at Aries):
                                                                                                                        * Degree ÷ 12 = remainder
                                                                                                                        * Count remainder forward from Aries (0 = Aries, 1 = Taurus, 2 = Gemini, etc.)
For Even Signs (start at Libra):
                                                                                                                        * Degree ÷ 12 = remainder
                                                                                                                        * Count remainder forward from Libra (0 = Libra, 1 = Scorpio, 2 = Sagittarius, etc.)

5.7 Elvis Presley Example: Sun Spark
Direct Quote:
“In Elvis’ case, his sun is at eight degrees. So eight degrees in an odd sign, because he’s in Capricorn, which is an even sign—wait, let me look at that. Capricorn, so he’s in an even sign. So we start with Libra. Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius, Pisces, Aries, Taurus, Gemini. So eight degrees Capricorn would give us a Gemini spark.”

Interpretation:
Direct Quote:
“Gemini being the mental, it being the communicative. Elvis was known for his voice, known for being like an entertainer and like having the mind—like he wasn’t necessarily known for being like super smart, but he had a mind and he was very clever and he was very witty.”
Elvis’s vitality (Sun):
                                                                                                                        * Operates in: 6th house (daily work/health)
                                                                                                                        * Pulls from: 9th house (performance/teaching) [BASE]
                                                                                                                        * Expresses through: Capricorn (structured, serious)
                                                                                                                        * First engages via: Gemini (mental, communicative, witty) [SPARK]
The Gemini Spark explains WHY Elvis was such a compelling communicator and entertainer—his vitality ENTERED through mental agility and communication before expressing through the more serious Capricorn tone.

5.8 Instructor’s Personal Example: Sun Spark
Direct Quote:
“I have a sun at 26 degrees Leo. So let’s see here. So my sun is in an odd sign. So we start with Aries. 26 divided by 12 is two remainder two. So we start with Aries. So Aries, Taurus, Gemini. So my spark is Gemini.”
Instructor’s Sun Details:
                                                                                                                        * Sign: Leo (ODD sign)
                                                                                                                        * Degree: 26°
Spark Calculation Method 1 (Counting):
                                                                                                                        1. Leo is ODD → start at Aries
                                                                                                                        2. Count 26 degrees forward from Aries [would take a while]
Spark Calculation Method 2 (Modular Arithmetic):
                                                                                                                        1. 26 ÷ 12 = 2 remainder 2
                                                                                                                        2. Start at Aries (0)
                                                                                                                        3. Count 2 forward: Aries(0)→Taurus(1)→Gemini(2)
                                                                                                                        4. Sun’s Spark = Gemini
Personal Reflection:
Direct Quote:
“So with my sun having a Gemini spark, that means that the way that I enter into my vitality is through the mind, is through thought, is through communication. And I’m sure everyone here can be like, ‘Yep, that checks out.’ Like that makes a lot of sense to me. Like I’m an educator. I’m a teacher. The way that I engage with my vitality, which my sun is in Leo, so it’s very vibrant and it’s very expansive and it’s very like empowering. But the way I enter into it is very Gemini. It’s very like conversational, it’s very casual, right?”
Interpretation:
The instructor’s vitality (Sun in Leo) is naturally vibrant and empowering (Leo tone), BUT the entry point (Spark) is Gemini:
                                                                                                                        * Communication-first approach
                                                                                                                        * Intellectual engagement
                                                                                                                        * Conversational teaching style
                                                                                                                        * Mental agility
This explains why she teaches astrology (Leo vitality) through talking, explaining, and mental frameworks (Gemini spark) rather than through, say, silent meditation or physical demonstration.

5.9 Daughter’s Example: Sun and Mercury Spark
Direct Quote:
“My daughter has sun at five degrees Virgo. So sun at five degrees Virgo—Virgo is an even sign. So we start with Libra. Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius, Pisces. So she has a Pisces spark. She also has Mercury at five degrees Virgo. So same thing. So she has a Pisces spark for both of those.”

Interpretation:
Direct Quote:
“And I see it. She literally has to… she’s actually very analytical, very detail oriented because, you know, she’s very Virgo. But the way that she gets there has to be very dream-like. It has to be very intuitive. Like there has to be a flow to it. And once she’s in the flow, then she can move into like the analysis and the organization and the perfection. But if she can’t find the flow, if she can’t like dream it up, if she can’t like be very Pisces about it, then she can’t get into her Virgo energy. She can’t get into her mental energy. And that’s just who she is.”
Key Insight:
The daughter expresses as VIRGO (analytical, detail-oriented, organized), but she cannot access that energy without first moving through PISCES (flow, intuition, dreaminess).
This reveals the sequential nature of Spark:
                                                                                                                        1. SPARK (Pisces) = Entry point / doorway
                                                                                                                        2. SIGN (Virgo) = Full expression once inside
She must first “dream her way in” before she can analyze and organize.

5.10 Why Spark Matters: Entry Points vs. Full Expression
Direct Quote:
“The way that it enters is the spark. The next stage, literally the next way you dive into that energy is the pulse, which is the decan, which we’re not talking about today. Then you have the tone, which is the sign.”
The Layered Model:
Traditional astrology: “You ARE your sign”
                                                                                                                        * Sun in Virgo = You are analytical
Alchemistic Astrology: “You ACCESS your sign through your spark”
                                                                                                                        * Sun in Virgo with Pisces Spark = You must first flow/dream (Pisces), THEN you can analyze (Virgo)
Why This Changes Everything:
Two people with Sun in Virgo might have:
                                                                                                                        * Person A: Aries Spark → Enters through ACTION, then organizes
                                                                                                                        * Person B: Pisces Spark → Enters through FLOW, then organizes
Both are “Virgo suns” but their experience is completely different because the entry mechanism differs.
App Development Implication:
Don’t just show “Sun in Virgo”—show:
SUN IN VIRGO
├─ Spark: Pisces (Entry through intuition/flow)
├─ Full Expression: Analytical, detail-oriented (Virgo)
└─ Interpretation: Must dream/flow first, then organize


This gives users actionable insight into HOW to access their energy, not just WHAT their energy is.

5.11 Spark vs. Decan vs. Sign
Direct Quote:
“The way that it enters is the spark. The next stage, literally the next way you dive into that energy is the pulse, which is the decan, which we’re not talking about today. Then you have the tone, which is the sign.”
Three Layers of Engagement:
                                                                                                                        1. SPARK (Degree) = First engagement / doorway / initial entry
                                                                                                                        2. PULSE (Decan) = Second engagement / deeper entry [not covered in Transcript 15]
                                                                                                                        3. TONE (Sign) = Full expression / mature manifestation
Metaphor:
Entering a house:
                                                                                                                        * Spark = Which door you use (front door? back door? window?)
                                                                                                                        * Pulse = Which hallway you walk down once inside
                                                                                                                        * Tone = Which room you ultimately arrive in
The ROOM (sign) is where you spend your time, but HOW YOU GOT THERE (spark → pulse) affects your experience of the room.

6. READING SEQUENCE INTEGRATION
6.1 Complete Reading Order with All Components
Direct Quote:
“So when we’re reading a placement, we’re going to be reading: Planet, Spark—which is the first thing, actually Planet in Field rather, the house that we’re talking about. First thing, the planet becomes the focus. The way that it enters is the spark. The next stage, literally the next way you dive into that energy is the pulse, which is the decan, which we’re not talking about today. Then you have the tone, which is the sign. Then you have the field, which is the house, which is like the house that we’re reading that the planet is in. And then we have the base.”

                                                                                                                        1. PLANET → What is the focus? (Sun = vitality, Moon = emotional needs, Mars = action, etc.)
                                                                                                                        2. SPARK → How do I first engage this energy? (Calculated from degree)
                                                                                                                        3. PULSE → How do I deepen into this energy? (Decan - not covered here)

                                                                                                                        5. FIELD → Where does this energy operate? (House - MOST IMPORTANT)
                                                                                                                        6. BASE → Where does this energy pull from? (House of ruled sign)
Hierarchy of Importance:
Direct Quote:
“The house is first. The house is the field. That’s what I always say. That’s the most important part.”
While the reading sequence flows naturally from planet → spark → pulse → tone → field → base, the FIELD (house) is always the anchor for interpretation.

Integrated Interpretation:
Elvis’s vitality (Sun focus) pulls foundational energy from performance and teaching (9th house base), first engages through communication and mental wit (Gemini spark), expresses with structured seriousness and ambition (Capricorn tone), and operates in the field of daily work and physical health (6th house).
Narrative Synthesis:
Elvis was a performer and teacher (9th base) whose vitality entered through his clever communication and wit (Gemini spark). This manifested as serious, ambitious daily work (Capricorn in 6th) in the entertainment industry. His vitality wasn’t just “work”—it was PERFORMANCE-BASED work that required mental agility and communication skills to activate.
Why This Matters:
Traditional reading: “Sun in Capricorn in 6th = hardworking, health-focused”
True Placements reading: “Vitality operates through performance-teaching (base), accessed via wit/communication (spark), expressed seriously (tone) in daily work routines (field)”
The True Placements reading is:
                                                                                                                        * More dimensional
                                                                                                                        * More actionable (user knows HOW to access vitality)
                                                                                                                        * More accurate (explains WHY Elvis worked the way he did)

6.3 How to Apply This in Chart Reading
Direct Quote:
“And within True Placements, what we’re doing is we’re allowing all of these energies to stand alone. We’re giving them—each one of them their own value, their own stance, their own place to be able to express.”
Practical Reading Protocol:
Step 1: Identify the Planet
                                                                                                                        * What are we analyzing? (Sun, Moon, Mercury, etc.)
Step 2: Anchor in the Field (House)
                                                                                                                        * Which life area does this operate in?
                                                                                                                        * This is your PRIMARY anchor
Step 3: Calculate the Base
                                                                                                                        * What sign does this planet rule?
                                                                                                                        * Which house is that sign in?
                                                                                                                        * This is where the energy PULLS FROM
Step 4: Calculate the Spark
                                                                                                                        * What is the exact degree?
                                                                                                                        * Is the planet in an odd or even sign?
                                                                                                                        * Count forward from Aries (odd) or Libra (even)
                                                                                                                        * This is the ENTRY POINT
Step 5: Note the Tone (Sign)
                                                                                                                        * How does the energy EXPRESS?
                                                                                                                        * This is the FLAVOR
Step 6: Synthesize
                                                                                                                        * Create a narrative that connects: Base → Spark → Tone → Field
                                                                                                                        * Explain the energy flow from source to entry to expression to operation

MARS Analysis


FOCUS (Planet): Action, drive, assertion, will, determination


BASE (Source):
├─ Rules: Aries (and Scorpio)
├─ Aries Located in: 2nd House (example)
└─ Pulls from: Self-worth, resources, values, material security


SPARK (Entry):
├─ Degree: 14°
├─ Sign Polarity: Taurus is EVEN
├─ Calculation: Start Libra, count 14 → 14÷12=1 rem 2 → Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius
└─ Spark Sign: Sagittarius
└─ Entry Point: Expansion, philosophy, optimism, adventure


TONE (Expression):
└─ Sign: Taurus
└─ Expresses through: Steady, persistent, sensual, stubborn, grounded


FIELD (Operation):
└─ House: 11th
└─ Operates in: Groups, friendships, future goals, social causes


INTEGRATED MEANING:
This person's drive and action (Mars) pulls foundational energy from self-worth and material security (2nd house base). They first access their drive through expansion and philosophical thinking (Sagittarius spark), then express it in steady, persistent ways (Taurus tone) within group settings and future-oriented projects (11th house field).


Practically: They take action in social causes (11th) but are motivated by securing their own worth first (2nd base). They must first feel expansive and optimistic (Sagittarius spark) before they can activate their more stubborn, persistent drive (Taurus). Without that initial expansion, they can't access their drive at all.

7. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: ELVIS PRESLEY CASE STUDY
7.1 Elvis’s Complete Chart Context
Direct Quote:
“So in Elvis’ case, his sun is in Capricorn in the sixth house. That’s his placement. His base for his sun is going to be determined by Leo. So where is Leo in his chart? Leo is on the cusp of his ninth house.”

7.2 Sun Analysis: Performance-Based Daily Work
Complete Sun Breakdown:
FOCUS: Sun = Vitality, life force, ego, will, self-expression
BASE (9th House):
Direct Quote:
“So what we’re saying here is that even though his vitality focus is in his daily work, right, like his sun is in the sixth house, he’s working with his vitality in a very physical way, in a very daily way, the base of that, where he’s pulling from is this ninth house energy, which is the higher learning, the performance. You know, Elvis was an incredible performer. That’s like his thing.”
9th House Themes:
                                                                                                                        * Performance and stage presence

Interpretation: Elvis’s vitality didn’t just express through work (6th house)—it was ROOTED in performance energy (9th base). His work WAS performance.
SPARK (Gemini):
Direct Quote:
“Gemini being the mental, it being the communicative. Elvis was known for his voice, known for being like an entertainer and like having the mind—like he wasn’t necessarily known for being like super smart, but he had a mind and he was very clever and he was very witty.”
Gemini Themes:
                                                                                                                        * Communication and voice

7.3 Moon Analysis: Emotional Isolation and Transformation
Complete Moon Breakdown:
FOCUS: Moon = Emotional needs, safety, comfort, nurturing, instinctual responses
BASE (12th House):

Interpretation: His emotional world expressed through Pisces—highly sensitive, boundary-less, prone to escape mechanisms.
FIELD (8th House):

SYNTHESIS:
Direct Quote:
“What we’re looking at here is we have his emotional need for safety, the moon, within this transformative, shared resource kind of experience, the eighth house, and it’s in Pisces. So it’s very dissolvable, very escapism. The base of that is the twelfth house, which is where we lose sense of self. We transcend the ego. We are able to escape. There is a massive amount of isolation. There’s like a seclusion from the rest of the world.”
Elvis’s emotional safety needs were:
                                                                                                                        * Rooted in isolation/transcendence/escape (12th base)
                                                                                                                        * Expressed through dissolution/sensitivity/escapism (Pisces tone)
                                                                                                                        * Operated in intense transformation/shared intimacy (8th field)
This configuration explains:
                                                                                                                        * Substance abuse issues: 12th base + Pisces tone + 8th transformation = escape through substances
                                                                                                                        * Difficulty with boundaries: Pisces in 8th = merging with others, losing self in relationships
                                                                                                                        * Isolation despite fame: 12th base = needed solitude to feel emotionally safe
                                                                                                                        * Intense relationships: 8th house = deep, transformative emotional experiences
                                                                                                                        * Spiritual seeking: 12th base + Pisces = natural mystical inclinations
Tragic Outcome:
This Moon configuration reveals the vulnerability in Elvis’s chart:
                                                                                                                        * He needed isolation (12th base) to feel safe
                                                                                                                        * His emotions dissolved boundaries (Pisces)
                                                                                                                        * He experienced this through intense transformation (8th)
                                                                                                                        * This manifested as substance abuse (escape mechanism) and difficulty maintaining healthy emotional boundaries

8. Q&A: COMMON QUESTIONS AND ADVANCED CLARIFICATIONS
8.1 Understanding the Dual Wheel Visually
Question (Implied from Instructor’s Explanation):
 “How do I visualize the dual wheel system?”
Direct Quote:
“So when we talk about the dual wheel, what do we mean by that? Well, we have this inner wheel, which is the house. This is going to be created by the earth’s rotation. This is the core. And then we have an outer wheel, which is the sign, which is going to be created by the universe, which is the ecliptic, and this is the field that we’re going to move through.”
Answer:
Visualize two concentric circles:
INNER CIRCLE (Houses):
                                                                                                                                    * Divided into 12 sections
                                                                                                                                    * Numbered 1-12

8.2 Dual Rulers: Which Base to Use?
Direct Quote:
“When you have a planet like Mercury or Venus or Mars or Jupiter or Saturn, they all rule two signs. So for any of those planets, you actually have two bases. And how do you decide which one to be pulling from? That’s something you have to determine. Like you have to look at your own chart and be like, ‘Which one makes more sense for me?’ You get to make that choice.”
Question: “Mercury rules both Gemini and Virgo. Which base do I use?”
Answer:
Dual-Ruling Planets:
                                                                                                                                    * Mercury: Gemini + Virgo → Two bases
                                                                                                                                    * Venus: Taurus + Libra → Two bases
                                                                                                                                    * Mars: Aries + Scorpio → Two bases
                                                                                                                                    * Jupiter: Sagittarius + Pisces → Two bases
                                                                                                                                    * Saturn: Capricorn + Aquarius → Two bases
Resolution Method:
Step 1: Calculate BOTH bases
                                                                                                                                    * Find Gemini in your chart → Note that house
                                                                                                                                    * Find Virgo in your chart → Note that house
                                                                                                                                    * Both are valid Mercury bases
Step 2: Examine your life experience
                                                                                                                                    * Which base resonates more strongly?
                                                                                                                                    * Which base explains your Mercury expression better?
                                                                                                                                    * Which base do you feel pulling from more often?
Step 3: Choose through EXPERIENTIAL INVESTIGATION
                                                                                                                                    * This is not arbitrary—it’s based on YOUR lived reality
                                                                                                                                    * Trust your self-knowledge
                                                                                                                                    * The “correct” base is the one that ACCURATELY DESCRIBES your experience
Example:
Person with Mercury in Aries in 3rd house:
                                                                                                                                    * Base Option 1: Gemini in 5th house
                                                                                                                                    * Base Option 2: Virgo in 8th house
Investigation Questions:

                                                                                                                                    * Or does it pull from deep research and transformation (8th)?
                                                                                                                                    * Do you communicate to CREATE and PLAY (5th)?
                                                                                                                                    * Or do you communicate to PROBE and UNCOVER (8th)?
Whichever resonates = Your Base
App Development Implication:
 For dual-ruling planets, display BOTH potential bases and invite user to investigate which resonates. Don’t arbitrarily choose one.

8.3 Can You Change Your Base?
Implied Question: “If I have two bases, can I consciously shift which one I use?”
Answer (Synthesized from Transcript Context):
Yes, potentially—through transmutation:
Remember from Transcript 5 (Time to Manifest):
                                                                                                                                    * Energy is MALLEABLE
                                                                                                                                    * You can consciously TRANSMUTE from low to high vibration
                                                                                                                                    * Free will is central to Alchemistic Astrology
Application to Base:
If you have two bases (e.g., Mercury with Gemini and Virgo bases):
                                                                                                                                    1. Default Pattern: You may naturally default to one base
                                                                                                                                    2. Conscious Shift: Through awareness, you can intentionally pull from the other base
                                                                                                                                    3. Integration: Ideally, you learn to pull from BOTH as needed
Example:
Mercury with 5th (Gemini) and 8th (Virgo) bases:
                                                                                                                                    * Unconscious: Always communicates from depth/intensity (8th)
                                                                                                                                    * Conscious: Recognizes they can ALSO communicate from playfulness (5th)
                                                                                                                                    * Mastery: Chooses which base to pull from depending on context
App Development Note:
 Emphasize that having two bases is a GIFT—it provides flexibility and range in how you access the planetary energy.

8.4 Do Transiting Planets Have Bases?
Implied Question: “Do I calculate base for transiting planets, or only natal planets?”
Answer (Synthesized from System Logic):
Yes, transiting planets have bases:
Reasoning:
                                                                                                                                    * Base is determined by a planet’s natural rulership
                                                                                                                                    * Natural rulership doesn’t change whether the planet is natal or transiting
                                                                                                                                    * Sun ALWAYS rules Leo (natal or transit)
                                                                                                                                    * Therefore, transiting Sun always has a base determined by where Leo is in your NATAL chart
Example:
Your Natal Chart: Leo on 10th house cusp
Transiting Sun: Currently in Pisces in your 5th house
Transiting Sun’s Base:
                                                                                                                                    * Sun rules Leo
                                                                                                                                    * Leo is in YOUR 10th house
                                                                                                                                    * Transiting Sun’s base = 10th house (career/public life)
Interpretation:
The transiting Sun (moving through your 5th house of creativity) is PULLING from your 10th house (career/reputation). This suggests that during this transit, your creative endeavors (5th) are energetically connected to your career aspirations (10th base).
App Development Implication:
 Transit reports should include base calculations to show where transiting energies are SOURCING from in the user’s natal structure.

8.5 Does Spark Change with Progressions?
Implied Question: “As my planets progress, does the Spark change?”
Answer (Synthesized from System Logic):
Yes, Spark changes with secondary progressions:
Reasoning:
                                                                                                                                    * Spark is based on EXACT DEGREE
                                                                                                                                    * Secondary progressions move planets forward ~1° per year
                                                                                                                                    * As the degree changes, the Spark calculation changes
Example:
Natal: Sun at 15° Leo (odd sign)
                                                                                                                                    * Start at Aries
                                                                                                                                    * Count 15 forward: 15÷12=1 rem 3 → Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer
                                                                                                                                    * Natal Spark = Cancer
Age 30 Progression: Sun at 15° Virgo (even sign)
                                                                                                                                    * Start at Libra
                                                                                                                                    * Count 15 forward: 15÷12=1 rem 3 → Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn
                                                                                                                                    * Progressed Spark = Capricorn
Interpretation:
The person’s entry point into vitality EVOLVED:
                                                                                                                                    * Natal: Entered through emotional safety (Cancer)
                                                                                                                                    * Age 30: Now enters through structure and achievement (Capricorn)
This reflects MATURATION and changed approach to self-expression.
App Development Implication:
 Progression reports should recalculate Spark for progressed positions and note how the entry point has evolved.

No—calculation is the same:

                                                                                                                                    * Retrograde doesn’t change which sign a planet rules
                                                                                                                                    * Sun rules Leo whether direct or retrograde
                                                                                                                                    * Base calculation unchanged
Spark:
                                                                                                                                    * Spark is based on exact DEGREE
                                                                                                                                    * Retrograde affects the planet’s MOTION, not its degree at a specific moment
                                                                                                                                    * Calculate spark from the degree where the planet IS (whether moving forward or backward)
However, Retrograde Affects EXPRESSION:
From Transcript 1 (Natal Retrogrades):
                                                                                                                                    * Retrograde = internalized/review energy
                                                                                                                                    * May affect HOW you access the Spark
Example:
Mercury Retrograde at 20° Gemini
                                                                                                                                    * Base: Gemini in [X house] and Virgo in [Y house]
                                                                                                                                    * Spark: 20° in odd sign (Gemini) → Start Aries, count 20 → 20÷12=1 rem 8 → Sagittarius
                                                                                                                                    * Calculation is NORMAL
But Interpretation Shifts:
                                                                                                                                    * Mercury retrograde = internalized communication
                                                                                                                                    * Sagittarius spark = philosophical entry point
                                                                                                                                    * Combined: Internally philosophizes before communicating
Retrograde affects the NATURE of the expression, not the CALCULATION of base/spark.

Your vitality (Sun) pulls foundational energy from 
communication and learning (3rd house base). You first 
access this vitality through emotional safety and nurturing 
themes (Cancer spark), then express it with creative 
dramatic flair (Leo tone), all operating in the field of 
career and public reputation (10th house).


Practically: Your career success depends on learning and 
communicating (3rd base). You must feel emotionally safe 
(Cancer spark) before you can shine publicly. Once 
activated, you express with creative confidence (Leo).

9.10 Validation & Error Handling
Required Validations:
1. Degree Range Check:
                                                                                                                                    * function validateDegree(degree) {
                                                                                                                                    *   if (degree < 0 || degree >= 30) {
                                                                                                                                    *     throw new Error("Degree must be between 0 and 29.99");
                                                                                                                                    *   }
                                                                                                                                    *   return true;
                                                                                                                                    * }


2. Non-Ruling Planet Check:
function validatePlanetForBase(planet) {
  const rulingPlanets = [
    'Sun', 'Moon', 'Mercury', 'Venus', 'Mars', 
    'Jupiter', 'Saturn', 'Uranus', 'Neptune', 'Pluto'
  ];
  
  if (!rulingPlanets.includes(planet)) {
    return {
      error: true,
      message: `${planet} does not rule a sign and therefore has no Base.`,
      explanation: "Base calculations only apply to the 10 traditional ruling planets."
    };
  }
  return { error: false };
}


3. Missing House Cusp Data:
function validateHouseCusps(natalChart) {
  for (let i = 1; i <= 12; i++) {
    if (!natalChart.houses[i].cuspSign) {
      throw new Error(`Missing house cusp data for house ${i}`);
    }
  }
  return true;
}

9.11 Performance Optimization
Caching Strategy:
Base and Spark calculations are deterministic—they don’t change unless birth data changes.
// Cache calculated values
const calculationCache = {
  base: {},
  spark: {}
};


function getCachedBase(planet, chartId) {
  const cacheKey = `${chartId}_${planet}`;
  if (calculationCache.base[cacheKey]) {
    return calculationCache.base[cacheKey];
  }
  
  const result = calculateBase(planet, getNatalChart(chartId));
  calculationCache.base[cacheKey] = result;
  return result;
}


Batch Calculation:
Calculate all True Placements components for all 10 planets at once during chart load:
function generateTruePlacementsReport(natalChart) {
  const planets = ['Sun', 'Moon', 'Mercury', 'Venus', 'Mars', 
                   'Jupiter', 'Saturn', 'Uranus', 'Neptune', 'Pluto'];
  
  const report = {};
  
  planets.forEach(planet => {
    const planetData = natalChart.planets[planet];
    
    report[planet] = {
      focus: getPlanetMeaning(planet),
      field: planetData.house,
      tone: planetData.sign,
      base: calculateBase(planet, natalChart),
      spark: calculateSpark(planetData.degree, planetData.sign),
      integratedReading: generateIntegratedReading(planet, /* ... */)
    };
  });
  
  return report;
}

10. SUMMARY & KEY TAKEAWAYS
10.1 Core Concepts Introduced
TRUE PLACEMENTS SYSTEM:
 A comprehensive framework for understanding how planetary energies operate through the dual wheel structure, separating house (field) from sign (tone) and revealing energy sources (base) and entry points (spark).
THE DUAL WHEEL:
                                                                                                                                    * Inner Wheel (Houses): Created by Earth’s rotation; represents YOUR core energy fields; MOST IMPORTANT
                                                                                                                                    * Outer Wheel (Signs): Created by Earth’s orbit; represents universal membrane/tone; SECONDARY modifier
                                                                                                                                    * Planets exist BETWEEN these layers, having both a field position (house) and an expression style (sign)
BASE CONCEPT:
                                                                                                                                    * Definition: The house position of the sign a planet rules
                                                                                                                                    * Purpose: Shows where a planet PULLS foundational energy from
                                                                                                                                    * Mechanism: Bidirectional rulership creates energy channel between planet and the house its ruled sign occupies
                                                                                                                                    * Limitation: Only applies to the 10 ruling planets (Sun through Pluto)
                                                                                                                                    * Dual Rulers: Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn have TWO bases; user determines which resonates through experiential investigation
SPARK CONCEPT:
                                                                                                                                    * Definition: First engagement with planetary energy, determined by exact degree
                                                                                                                                    * Purpose: Shows HOW you ENTER/ACCESS the planet’s energy before full expression
                                                                                                                                    * Calculation: Based on sign polarity (odd vs even) and perpetual zodiacal progression
                                                                                                                                    * Odd Signs (Aries, Gemini, Leo, Libra, Sagittarius, Aquarius): Start at Aries (0°), count forward
                                                                                                                                    * Even Signs (Taurus, Cancer, Virgo, Scorpio, Capricorn, Pisces): Start at Libra (0°), count forward
                                                                                                                                    * Formula: Degree ÷ 12 = remainder; count remainder forward from starting sign
                                                                                                                                    * Distinguishes from Nicholas’s flawed system by maintaining celestial continuity

10.4 Why Sign “Doesn’t Mean Anything”
Clarification:
 The instructor’s provocative statement doesn’t mean signs are useless—it means they are NOT the primary defining factor.
Hierarchy:
                                                                                                                                    1. HOUSE (field) - Defines WHERE energy operates [MOST IMPORTANT]
                                                                                                                                    2. PLANET (focus) - Defines WHAT the energy is about
                                                                                                                                    3. BASE (source) - Defines WHERE it pulls from
                                                                                                                                    4. SPARK (entry) - Defines HOW to access it
                                                                                                                                    5. SIGN (tone) - Colors HOW it expresses [LEAST important for core meaning]
Traditional Error:
 Saying “I’m a Leo sun” emphasizes SIGN (tone) over HOUSE (field), leading to superficial interpretation.
Correct Approach:
 “I have Sun in the 10th house (career) with Leo tone (creative expression), Gemini spark (mental entry), and 3rd house base (communication foundation)”

Energy is Malleable:
 True Placements doesn’t create rigid definitions—it reveals MECHANISMS through which you can CONSCIOUSLY WORK with energy.
Free Will Emphasized:
                                                                                                                                                      * Dual bases offer CHOICE
                                                                                                                                                      * Spark reveals ACCESS POINT (you can learn to activate it)
                                                                                                                                                      * Understanding source (base) allows conscious realignment
Transmutation Application:
                                                                                                                                                      * If your spark is challenging, you can WORK with that entry point
                                                                                                                                                      * If your base is in a difficult house, you can CONSCIOUSLY transmute that foundational energy
                                                                                                                                                      * True Placements provides the MAP; you choose the route
Practical Empowerment:
 Knowing your Sun’s Gemini spark (for example) means you know you must COMMUNICATE or THINK your way into vitality. This is ACTIONABLE wisdom, not fatalistic description.

10.9 Common Misconceptions Corrected
MISCONCEPTION #1: “Base is the same as the house the planet is IN”
                                                                                                                                                      * CORRECTION: Base is the house of the SIGN THE PLANET RULES, not where the planet sits
                                                                                                                                                      * Example: Sun in 6th house does NOT mean 6th is the base; Leo’s house position is the base
MISCONCEPTION #2: “Spark resets every sign like Nicholas’s system”
                                                                                                                                                      * CORRECTION: Spark uses PERPETUAL PROGRESSION through the zodiac; no resetting every 12 degrees
MISCONCEPTION #3: “Saying sign doesn’t matter means ignore signs completely”
                                                                                                                                                      * CORRECTION: Signs matter as TONE/EXPRESSION but are not the PRIMARY defining factor; houses are
MISCONCEPTION #4: “You can calculate base for Chiron or asteroids”
                                                                                                                                                      * CORRECTION: Base ONLY works for the 10 ruling planets; other bodies don’t rule signs
MISCONCEPTION #5: “Dual bases mean the chart is broken or unclear”
                                                                                                                                                      * CORRECTION: Dual bases are a FEATURE, offering flexibility; user determines which resonates through self-investigation

10.11 Key Quotes for Reference
On the Dual Wheel:
“The inner wheel, the houses that are created from the earth’s rotation, this is the core. Meaning that this is our most intimate relationship with energy. Why? Because you are an extension of the earth.”
On Base:
“So a base is the bidirectional energy that we are pulling from. And what we’re doing is we’re finding that through the ruler.”
On Spark:
“The spark is your first engagement within the energy. So what we’re doing is we’re looking at the degree that the planet is in.”
On Reading Sequence:
“Planet, Spark—which is the first thing, actually Planet in Field rather, the house that we’re talking about. First thing, the planet becomes the focus. The way that it enters is the spark… Then you have the tone, which is the sign. Then you have the field, which is the house… And then we have the base.”
On Sign’s Role:
“This is why I laugh about it all the time: people want to do sign zodiac or they want to do planet zodiac. Sign doesn’t mean anything.”
On Elvis’s Sun:
“Even though his vitality focus is in his daily work… the base of that, where he’s pulling from is this ninth house energy, which is the higher learning, the performance. You know, Elvis was an incredible performer. That’s like his thing.”
On Elvis’s Moon:
“His emotional need for safety, the moon, within this transformative, shared resource kind of experience, the eighth house, and it’s in Pisces. So it’s very dissolvable, very escapism. The base of that is the twelfth house, which is where we lose sense of self.”

                                                                                                                                                      * Provides actionable insight (how to ACCESS energy, not just what it IS)
                                                                                                                                                      * Reveals hidden motivations (Base shows energy source)
                                                                                                                                                      * Explains life patterns with depth (Elvis case study demonstrates)

1. INTRODUCTION & PHILOSOPHICAL FRAMEWORK
1.1 Opening Context and Webinar Purpose
Direct Quote:
“Thank you so much for being here and welcome to the Aspect Spectrum webinar. What we’re doing here is helping you understand the major aspects within alchemical astrology. There are seven of them. In other systems of astrology, there are five because they ignore the semi-sextile and they ignore the quincunx. We want to make sure that you understand that every single one of these 30 divisions within the… 30-degree divisions within the 360-degree wheel is important and is actually a major aspect.”


Webinar Purpose:
The Aspect Spectrum webinar serves as a comprehensive framework for understanding how planetary relationships evolve through geometric space. Unlike traditional aspect interpretation, which treats each aspect as an isolated event, this system presents aspects as a continuous journey through the zodiacal circle.
Target Audience:
This is an intermediate-to-advanced class. The instructor assumes participants already understand:
                                                                                                                                                      * Basic chart structure (houses, signs, planets)
                                                                                                                                                      * The concept of planetary aspects
                                                                                                                                                      * The dual wheel system (inner wheel = houses; outer wheel = signs)
                                                                                                                                                      * PHSR interpretation method
                                                                                                                                                      * Bidirectional energy concepts
What Makes This System Different:
Traditional astrology recognizes five major aspects:
                                                                                                                                                      1. Conjunction (0°)
                                                                                                                                                      2. Sextile (60°)
                                                                                                                                                      3. Square (90°)
                                                                                                                                                      4. Trine (120°)
                                                                                                                                                      5. Opposition (180°)
Alchemistic Astrology recognizes seven major aspects, adding:
6. Semi-Sextile (30°)
7. Quincunx/Inconjunct (150°)
This expansion is not arbitrary—it’s based on the principle that every 30-degree division of the 360° wheel represents a significant geometric relationship worthy of major aspect status.

1.2 The Journey Metaphor: Aspects as Adventure
Direct Quote:
“As you see here, it is a journey through the major geometry. I called it a solar lunar tail. Go ahead and mute your mics, guys. Cool, thank you. I called it a solar lunar tail because… Move this real quick. There we go. Because what I’m going to be doing is using the sun.”
The Core Metaphor:
Aspects are not static configurations—they are stages in a narrative arc. The instructor frames aspectual relationships as:
                                                                                                                                                      * A trek - Physical journey with progressive stages
                                                                                                                                                      * An adventure - Dynamic experience with challenges and resolutions
                                                                                                                                                      * An evolution - Developmental process where each stage leads to the next
                                                                                                                                                      * A story - Narrative with beginning, middle, climax, and return
Why Journey Language Matters:
Direct Quote:
“And this is why I had to create the aspect spectrum, because what I realized is that through the major energies, It’s more like a trek that these energies go out on, like a journey, like embarking on this adventure. And from the conjunction, when one planet stays behind and the other one leaves, the relationship is a gradual… It’s a story. It’s an evolution. It’s one thing leads to the next, leads to the next, leads to the next, leads to the next, and it gets all the way to the opposition.”
Traditional astrology says: “You have a square between Mars and Saturn”
                                                                                                                                                      * This is a static snapshot
                                                                                                                                                      * Treats the aspect as fixed/permanent
                                                                                                                                                      * Doesn’t account for the evolutionary context
Aspect Spectrum says: “Mars and Saturn are at the square stage of their journey”
                                                                                                                                                      * This is a dynamic process
                                                                                                                                                      * Recognizes past (conjunction, semi-sextile, sextile) and future (trine, quincunx, opposition)
                                                                                                                                                      * Understands current friction as part of larger developmental arc
Practical Implication:
When you understand aspects as journey stages, you can:
                                                                                                                                                      1. Contextualize current challenges - “This square makes sense because we just left the sextile cooperation phase”
                                                                                                                                                      2. Anticipate future evolution - “After we work through this square, we’ll reach the supportive trine”
                                                                                                                                                      3. Identify where you are in the cycle - “Are we applying toward the aspect or separating from it?”
                                                                                                                                                      4. Read both directions - “What did we leave behind at conjunction? Where are we heading at opposition?”

1.3 Why the Instructor Created Aspect Spectrum
Direct Quote:
“The way that I viewed the aspects when I was first getting into it and the reason why aspect spectrum came about is I saw so much conflicting information, not as much with conjunctions. I think people got that. This is here. This is here. They’re together. Now you’re going to see that there’s more to it than that.”
Problems with Traditional Aspect Interpretation:
1. Semi-Sextile Neglect:
Direct Quote:
“But I saw that when we got to the semi-sextile, nobody talked about it. No one knew what it meant.”
Traditional astrology either:
                                                                                                                                                      * Ignores the semi-sextile entirely
                                                                                                                                                      * Calls it a “minor aspect” without explaining its function
                                                                                                                                                      * Provides vague, contradictory keywords
2. Sextile Oversimplification:
Direct Quote:
“When I got to the sextile, they usually defined it as a mini trine. And I was like, this just doesn’t make sense.”
The “mini trine” description:
                                                                                                                                                      * Collapses the sextile’s unique function
                                                                                                                                                      * Misses the opportunity/effort dynamic
                                                                                                                                                      * Doesn’t explain why it’s 60° (not 120°)
3. Square Partial Understanding:
Direct Quote:
“In the square, there’s a lot that they get, but there’s a lot missing.”
Traditional astrology recognizes square = tension/challenge, but misses:
                                                                                                                                                      * The equal support requirement
                                                                                                                                                      * The turnover point at exactitude
                                                                                                                                                      * The shift from Planet One to Planet Two focus
4. Quincunx Dismissal:
Direct Quote:
“They ignore the quincunx.”
The 150° aspect is either:
                                                                                                                                                      * Treated as minor/irrelevant
                                                                                                                                                      * Given confusing “adjustment” keywords
                                                                                                                                                      * Not integrated into the major aspect framework
5. Opposition Misunderstanding:
Direct Quote:
“And the opposition, I think, is the worst one. I think it’s the most misunderstood aspect.”
Traditional interpretation says:
                                                                                                                                                      * Opposition = conflict, enemies, polarization
                                                                                                                                                      * Must “compromise” to resolve
                                                                                                                                                      * One side vs the other
This misses:
                                                                                                                                                      * The handoff point mechanism
                                                                                                                                                      * The balance vs compromise distinction
                                                                                                                                                      * The role reversal that occurs at 180°
The Solution: Aspect Spectrum
Direct Quote:
“And this is why I had to create the aspect spectrum, because what I realized is that through the major energies, It’s more like a trek that these energies go out on, like a journey, like embarking on this adventure.”
The Aspect Spectrum system:
                                                                                                                                                      1. Includes all seven major aspects (restoring semi-sextile and quincunx)
                                                                                                                                                      2. Maps them as a journey (conjunction → opposition → back to conjunction)
                                                                                                                                                      3. Identifies handoff points (where Planet One/Two roles switch)
                                                                                                                                                      4. Provides perception vs reality (how it feels vs how to resolve it)
                                                                                                                                                      5. Honors geometric precision (exact degrees matter more than signs/houses)
________________


1.4 Geometry Over Symbolism
Direct Quote:
“Another thing I want to preface that I’m going to mention again in a second anyway is that what we’re doing is using the houses kind of for reference. But this goes to any 30-degree aspect. The geometry, the major geometry between them is that the 30 degrees are the major aspects. This can happen within an orb of influence within the same sign, within the same house. If you have something at zero degrees and something at 28 degrees, it can be semi-sextile. If you have something that is in the first house, in the second house, it can be sextile. It can also be conjunct.”
Core Principle:
GEOMETRIC DEGREE RELATIONSHIPS > House/Sign/Element/Modality
Traditional Astrology Approach:
“Mars in Aries squares Saturn in Cancer”
                                                                                                                                                      * Emphasizes signs (Aries vs Cancer)
                                                                                                                                                      * Focuses on element clash (fire vs water)
                                                                                                                                                      * May mention modality (cardinal vs cardinal)
                                                                                                                                                      * Degree is secondary
Aspect Spectrum Approach:
“Mars at 15° and Saturn at 15° are exactly 90° apart”
                                                                                                                                                      * Starts with precise geometric relationship
                                                                                                                                                      * Then adds sign/house/element context
                                                                                                                                                      * Recognizes aspect works the same regardless of signs
Critical Clarification:
Direct Quote:
“It just depends on the degree. So this is where the math and the geometry are extremely important.”
Example 1: Aspect Within Same Sign
Planet A at 0° Aries
Planet B at 28° Aries
= 28° separation = Semi-Sextile (even though same sign)
Example 2: Aspect Across Sign Boundaries
Planet A at 29° Pisces
Planet B at 1° Aries
= 2° separation = Conjunction (even though different signs)
Example 3: Aspect Within Neighboring Houses
Planet A at 28° in 1st house
Planet B at 2° in 2nd house
= Could be Sextile (60° apart) OR Conjunction (4° apart)
→ Must calculate exact degrees to know
Mathematical Foundation:
Direct Quote:
“Although we’re only… Although we’re displaying a natal chart wheel, the aspects are based on the degree relationships, not house, sign, element, or modality. Everything comes down to the math, the trigonometry, the geometry, all right?”
The 360° circle divides into:
                                                                                                                                                      * 12 signs × 30° each = 360°
                                                                                                                                                      * 12 houses (via Whole Signs) × 30° each = 360°
                                                                                                                                                      * Major aspects = multiples of 30°:
                                                                                                                                                      * 0° (conjunction) = 30° × 0
                                                                                                                                                      * 30° (semi-sextile) = 30° × 1
                                                                                                                                                      * 60° (sextile) = 30° × 2
                                                                                                                                                      * 90° (square) = 30° × 3
                                                                                                                                                      * 120° (trine) = 30° × 4
                                                                                                                                                      * 150° (quincunx) = 30° × 5
                                                                                                                                                      * 180° (opposition) = 30° × 6
This creates 12 aspect points around the wheel, with 7 major aspects mapping the journey from 0° → 180° → 0°.

1.5 Perception vs Reality: The Alchemical Framework
Direct Quote:
“So again, this perception, understanding this is the problem. It will aid you in identifying what needs to be adjusted towards opportunity. So realizing that the way it’s naturally going to play out is often going to create an issue. The reality, which is based on the solution, this is what’s actually going on. It’s the solution to realize and align with. Being able to reorient the trajectory of each energy lets all of the pieces connect in their natural relationship with the least amount of friction.”
The Dual Framework:
Every aspect has TWO interpretative layers:
1. PERCEPTION (How it feels / Automatic response):
                                                                                                                                                      * The natural, unconscious way the aspect plays out
                                                                                                                                                      * Usually creates friction, problems, or missed opportunities
                                                                                                                                                      * Based on ego/conditioning/habit
                                                                                                                                                      * Planet One thinks it’s right; Planet Two seems like the problem
2. REALITY (How it works / Solution):
                                                                                                                                                      * The true energetic mechanism
                                                                                                                                                      * Reveals what needs conscious adjustment
                                                                                                                                                      * Based on geometric energy flow
                                                                                                                                                      * Planet One must align with Planet Two for resolution
Why This Matters:
Direct Quote:
“And that’s really what we’re talking about with alchemy. We don’t want the friction. We don’t want the problems. We want a solution. And we want something that feels it’s easier.”

GOLD (Reality):
                                                                                                                                                      * Conscious aspect integration
                                                                                                                                                      * Harmonious energy flow
                                                                                                                                                      * Both planets working together
                                                                                                                                                      * Resolution, growth, transmutation
The Reorientation Process:
Step 1: Identify the perception (how the aspect naturally plays out - usually problematic)
Step 2: Understand the reality (what the geometric relationship actually requires)
Step 3: Reorient Planet One’s trajectory toward Planet Two
Step 4: Allow “all of the pieces connect in their natural relationship with the least amount of friction”
Example (Preview - Detailed Later):
Square Perception:
 “Mars (Planet One) feels Saturn (Planet Two) is blocking its action. Mars wants to fight/overcome Saturn.”
Square Reality:
 “Both Mars and Saturn must be used equally. Saturn isn’t the enemy—it’s the structure Mars needs to channel its energy effectively. Reorient Mars to work WITH Saturn’s boundaries.”
This perception/reality split appears in the Aspect Spectrum PDF guide (mentioned throughout the webinar) and forms the basis for all aspect interpretations in this system.

How to Use the PDF:
Direct Quote:
“But what you’re going to see here is perception and then reality. So you’re going to see how the energies naturally are going to play out…everything that says perception in this. is how you can expect this energy to play out which like i said usually causes a problem because when we get down to planet one and planet two planet one’s the problem planet two is the solution but The way in our perception is that we think that planet one has the right of way and that planet two is the problem, when in reality, that’s not the way it actually works.”
Practical Application:
When analyzing an aspect in a chart:
                                                                                                                                                      1. Locate the aspect on the PDF wheel (e.g., “I have Sun square Moon”)
                                                                                                                                                      2. Check the Perception description - “This is how it will naturally feel (usually problematic)”
                                                                                                                                                      3. Read the Reality description - “This is what actually needs to happen for resolution”
                                                                                                                                                      4. Note which planet is supported - “Focus efforts here for this stage of the journey”
                                                                                                                                                      5. Apply to your chart - Use the framework to reorient the energy flow
Reference During Uncertainty:
Direct Quote:
“If you ever feel unsure, please revert back to this framework. If it’s near the conjunction, it’s going to favor a certain planet. If it’s near the opposition, beyond the turnover point, it’s going to favor the other planet.”

                                                                                                                                                      * Whether the aspect is applying or separating
                                                                                                                                                      * Where the handoff/turnover points are
                                                                                                                                                      * How to read the aspect from both directions

2. THE SEVEN MAJOR ASPECTS: WHY NOT FIVE
2.1 The Traditional Five-Aspect System
Historical Context:
Traditional Western astrology (Ptolemaic system) recognizes five major aspects:
                                                                                                                                                      1. Conjunction (0°) - Planets together
                                                                                                                                                      2. Sextile (60°) - Harmonious, opportunity
                                                                                                                                                      3. Square (90°) - Tension, challenge
                                                                                                                                                      4. Trine (120°) - Harmony, ease
                                                                                                                                                      5. Opposition (180°) - Polarity, conflict
Why Only Five?
Traditional astrology bases major aspects on:
                                                                                                                                                      * Element relationships (same element = trine; different but compatible = sextile)
                                                                                                                                                      * Modality relationships (same modality = square/opposition)
                                                                                                                                                      * “Ptolemaic” authority (aspects recognized by Ptolemy in Tetrabiblos)
Aspects not fitting these criteria were deemed “minor”:
                                                                                                                                                      * Semi-sextile (30°)
                                                                                                                                                      * Quincunx/Inconjunct (150°)
                                                                                                                                                      * Plus various other angles (quintile, septile, etc.)

2.2 Why Alchemistic Astrology Includes Seven
Direct Quote:
“There are seven of them. In other systems of astrology, there are five because they ignore the semi-sextile and they ignore the quincunx. We want to make sure that you understand that every single one of these 30 divisions within the… 30-degree divisions within the 360-degree wheel is important and is actually a major aspect.”
The 30-Degree Principle:
The 360° circle divides naturally into twelve 30° segments:
                                                                                                                                                      * 360° ÷ 12 = 30°

                                                                                                                                                      * The 12 signs of the zodiac
                                                                                                                                                      * The 12 houses
                                                                                                                                                      * The fundamental units of the zodiacal wheel














Therefore:
Every multiple of 30° = Major aspect

	Why This Makes Geometric Sense:
Direct Quote:
“The geometry, the major geometry between them is that the 30 degrees are the major aspects.”
The 30° increments create a complete geometric framework:
                                                                                                                                                      * They map evenly around the circle
                                                                                                                                                      * They create consistent mathematical relationships
                                                                                                                                                      * They honor the fundamental 12-fold division of the zodiac
                                                                                                                                                      * They leave no arbitrary gaps in the progression
Contrast with Traditional System:
Traditional system jumps from:
                                                                                                                                                      * 0° (conjunction)
                                                                                                                                                      * → skips 30° ←
                                                                                                                                                      * 60° (sextile)
                                                                                                                                                      * 90° (square)
                                                                                                                                                      * 120° (trine)
                                                                                                                                                      * → skips 150° ←
                                                                                                                                                      * 180° (opposition)
This creates inconsistent intervals and misses two critical stages in the aspectual journey.

2.3 The Case for Semi-Sextile (30°)
Direct Quote:
“But I saw that when we got to the semi-sextile, nobody talked about it. No one knew what it meant.”
Why Semi-Sextile Was Ignored:
Traditional astrology couldn’t explain the semi-sextile because:
                                                                                                                                                      1. No element relationship - 30° separates adjacent signs (different elements, often incompatible)
                                                                                                                                                      2. No modality pattern - Adjacent signs have different modalities
                                                                                                                                                      3. “Too close” to conjunction - Seemed redundant
                                                                                                                                                      4. Weak observable effects - Subtle, hard to pin down
Aspect Spectrum Perspective:
The semi-sextile is essential because it represents:
The First Separation Stage:
Direct Quote:
“Now we’re moving away. Now we’ve reached past some minor aspects, and now we’re into the 30-degree semi-sextile relationship. And the sun feels it cannot shine because of the 30-degree relationship with the moon. … This produces a hard stop or a reason why the sun feels stagnated… the reality is that the moon has reached a 30 degree advancement into an area the sun doesn’t understand… It’s a conflict between here and there. It’s kind of like a blind spot.”
Semi-Sextile Function:
After the merger of conjunction (0°), the semi-sextile (30°) represents:
                                                                                                                                                      * Initial differentiation - “We’re no longer the same”
                                                                                                                                                      * Blind spot dynamics - “I can sense you but can’t fully see you”
                                                                                                                                                      * Hard stop feeling - “Something is blocking me but I don’t know what”
                                                                                                                                                      * Necessary discomfort - Forces awareness of the other planet’s separate needs
Developmental Necessity:
Without the semi-sextile stage, we’d jump directly from:
                                                                                                                                                      * Conjunction (total fusion)
                                                                                                                                                      * To sextile (cooperative awareness)
This skips the awkward, uncomfortable individuation phase where planets must recognize they are separate beings with separate needs.
Metaphor:
                                                                                                                                                      * Conjunction = Two people hugging
                                                                                                                                                      * Semi-Sextile = They step back slightly, but it’s too close for comfort—awkward distance
                                                                                                                                                      * Sextile = They’re now at comfortable talking distance
The semi-sextile is that awkward moment that MUST happen for healthy differentiation.

2.4 The Case for Quincunx (150°)
Direct Quote:
“They ignore the quincunx. … Quincunx, one of my favorite aspects, just because… nobody wanted to figure this one out. And all they really know about is these two don’t really go together and there’s some sort of balancing. You’re not supposed to balance. That’s actually the key is you don’t try to balance these energies.”
Why Quincunx Was Ignored:
Traditional astrology struggled with 150° because:
                                                                                                                                                      1. No element compatibility - Signs 150° apart share no element relationship
                                                                                                                                                      2. No modality pattern - Different modalities with no clear connection
                                                                                                                                                      3. “Inconjunct” confusion - Also called inconjunct, suggesting incompatibility
                                                                                                                                                      4. Vague “adjustment” keywords - “Requires adjustment” without explaining how/why
Aspect Spectrum Perspective:
The quincunx is critical because it represents:
The Final Delegation Stage:
Direct Quote:
“So what ends up happening, … sun here at 150 degrees to the moon. The sun and the moon may feel like they’re at an impasse. My energy and your energy, we are just not combining. I don’t have anything for you. You don’t have anything for me. … But the reality is that the moon is a natural receiver for the sun, kind of like a trine. But the two are not meant to merge together. And that is key. So it’s not when people are like, ‘oh, you got to balance it out.’ You got to bring them together. No, that’s the worst thing you can do with the quincunx.”
Quincunx Function:
Between the trine (120°) and opposition (180°), the quincunx (150°) represents:
                                                                                                                                                      * Delegation, not integration - “I send this to you, you handle it separately”
                                                                                                                                                      * One-way communication - “I’m talking TO you, not WITH you”
                                                                                                                                                      * Compartmentalization - “These energies operate in separate domains”
                                                                                                                                                      * Directed influence - Like sending an email to the right person
Critical Distinction:
Direct Quote:
“The sun just has to aim its influence in the direction of the moon. … it’s just direction. I’m talking to you. I’m not talking, we’re not having a conversation. I’m just talking to you. You’re going to take the information and go away. But what if it’s you I’m supposed to talk to? Well, I just direct it to you so that I’m talking to the right person…”
What NOT To Do:
Traditional advice: “Balance the energies” or “Integrate them”
Aspect Spectrum correction: DON’T try to merge quincunx energies—they’re meant to remain separate but in directed communication.
Metaphor:
                                                                                                                                                      * Trine = Two people working together on the same project
                                                                                                                                                      * Quincunx = Person A delegates a task to Person B, who handles it independently
                                                                                                                                                      * Opposition = Two people working on opposite ends of the same project
The quincunx is the outsourcing or delegation stage—essential for completing the journey to opposition.

2.5 The Complete Seven-Aspect Framework
The Journey Map:
Stage
	Aspect
	Degree
	Function
	1
	Conjunction
	0°
	MERGER - Beginning, fusion, handoff point
	2
	Semi-Sextile
	30°
	BLIND SPOT - First separation, awkward awareness
	3
	Sextile
	60°
	COOPERATION - Comfortable distance, opportunity
	4
	Square
	90°
	FRICTION - Forced integration, equal support turnover
	5
	Trine
	120°
	FLOW - Unimpeded transmission, requires conscious aim
	6
	Quincunx
	150°
	DELEGATION - One-way direction, compartmentalization
	7
	Opposition
	180°
	BALANCE - Endpoint, role reversal, second handoff point
	Then the journey reverses:
After opposition (180°), planets travel BACK toward conjunction (360°/0°) through the SAME seven aspects in reverse order, but with Planet One and Planet Two roles switched.
Complete Cycle:
0° → 30° → 60° → 90° → 120° → 150° → 180° → 150° → 120° → 90° → 60° → 30° → 0°
(Conjunction → Opposition → Conjunction)
With Planet One/Two roles flipping at 180°.
Why Seven Aspects Are Non-Negotiable:
Direct Quote:
“We want to make sure that you understand that every single one of these 30 divisions within the… 30-degree divisions within the 360-degree wheel is important and is actually a major aspect.”

Each 30° increment plays a necessary role in the complete evolutionary journey from conjunction through opposition and back.

3. THE SOLAR LUNAR TAIL CONCEPT
3.1 Why Sun and Moon as Examples
Direct Quote:
“I called it a solar lunar tail. Go ahead and mute your mics, guys. Cool, thank you. I called it a solar lunar tail because… Move this real quick. There we go. Because what I’m going to be doing is using the sun. I’ll explain this in just a second, but I’m going to be using the sun and the moon just as examples, but this will apply to anything.”
Pedagogical Choice:
The instructor uses Sun and Moon as the primary example throughout the webinar because:
1. Universal Familiarity:
                                                                                                                                                      * Everyone has a Sun and Moon in their chart
                                                                                                                                                      * These are the most personal, immediately accessible planets
                                                                                                                                                      * Easy to understand “vitality” (Sun) and “emotional needs” (Moon) as distinct energies
2. Clear Speed Differential:
                                                                                                                                                      * Sun moves ~1° per day
                                                                                                                                                      * Moon moves ~12-15° per day
                                                                                                                                                      * Moon is ALWAYS the faster-moving body relative to Sun
                                                                                                                                                      * This makes Planet One/Planet Two roles very clear
3. Lunar Phase Parallel:
                                                                                                                                                      * The Sun-Moon relationship creates the lunar phases we observe
                                                                                                                                                      * New Moon = Conjunction
                                                                                                                                                      * Waxing phases = Separating aspects (0°-180°)
                                                                                                                                                      * Full Moon = Opposition
                                                                                                                                                      * Waning phases = Applying aspects (180°-360°)
                                                                                                                                                      * This gives a natural, observable reference for the aspect spectrum
4. Archetypal Significance:
                                                                                                                                                      * Sun = Conscious will, purpose, ego, yang
                                                                                                                                                      * Moon = Subconscious needs, safety, feeling, yin
                                                                                                                                                      * Their relationship maps fundamental human dynamics (will vs feeling, action vs response)
Universal Application:
Direct Quote:
“I’ll explain this in just a second, but I’m going to be using the sun and the moon just as examples, but this will apply to anything.”
Critical Clarification:
While the webinar uses Sun-Moon for clarity, ALL planetary pairs follow the same Aspect Spectrum mechanics:
                                                                                                                                                      * Mercury-Venus aspects
                                                                                                                                                      * Mars-Jupiter aspects
                                                                                                                                                      * Saturn-Uranus aspects
                                                                                                                                                      * Even Ascendant-planet aspects
                                                                                                                                                      * Any two points in the chart separated by angular distance
The Sun-Moon model is a teaching tool, not a limitation.

3.2 The Synodic Cycle Connection
Direct Quote:
“This is basically your synodic cycle, guys. This is how the… The sun would move in a synodic cycle, but this is similar to it. Where the sun is here, the moon goes through all the phases to the full moon and then comes back to the new moon. This is very similar to what’s actually happening.”
Synodic Cycle Defined:
A synodic cycle is the period between successive conjunctions of two celestial bodies as seen from Earth.
Sun-Moon Synodic Cycle:
                                                                                                                                                      * Begins at New Moon (conjunction)
                                                                                                                                                      * Moon moves away from Sun through zodiac
                                                                                                                                                      * Reaches Full Moon (opposition)
                                                                                                                                                      * Returns to New Moon (next conjunction)
                                                                                                                                                      * Complete cycle = ~29.5 days (lunar month)

	New Moon
	Cycle completes
	Why This Matters:
Observational Validation:
Anyone can watch the Moon through its phases and SEE the aspect spectrum in action:
                                                                                                                                                      * New Moon (conjunction) = Both Sun and Moon rise together
                                                                                                                                                      * First Quarter (square) = Tension/visibility increase
                                                                                                                                                      * Full Moon (opposition) = Sun and Moon opposite in sky
                                                                                                                                                      * Last Quarter (square) = Different tension as cycle completes
This gives empirical grounding to what could otherwise feel like abstract geometry.
Transits Application:
When transiting Moon aspects natal Sun (or any planet), it follows this same pattern:
                                                                                                                                                      * Conjunction = New cycle begins
                                                                                                                                                      * Square = Challenge/adjustment point
                                                                                                                                                      * Opposition = Awareness/fulfillment point
                                                                                                                                                      * Return to conjunction = Cycle completes
Understanding the lunar cycle helps students feel the aspect spectrum in real-time through Moon transits, which happen every month.

3.3 The “Tail” Metaphor
Why “Solar Lunar Tail”?
The word “tail” suggests:
                                                                                                                                                      1. Something trailing behind - The Moon follows the Sun through the zodiac
                                                                                                                                                      2. A connected wake - Like a comet’s tail, the aspect relationship creates an energetic trail
                                                                                                                                                      3. Visible path - The lunar phases create a visible “tail” of light from new to full
The Journey Begins:
Direct Quote:
“And from the conjunction, when one planet stays behind and the other one leaves, the relationship is a gradual… It’s a story. It’s an evolution. It’s one thing leads to the next, leads to the next, leads to the next, leads to the next, and it gets all the way to the opposition.”
Visualization:
Imagine standing on the Sun and watching the Moon depart:
Moment 1: Conjunction (0°)
                                                                                                                                                      * Sun and Moon together
                                                                                                                                                      * Moon begins to separate (faster movement)

3.4 Planet One Stays, Planet Two Leaves
Direct Quote:
“And from the conjunction, when one planet stays behind and the other one leaves, the relationship is a gradual… It’s a story. It’s an evolution.”
Critical Mechanic:
At the conjunction (0°), one planet is slower (stays relatively fixed) while the other is faster (departs).
In Sun-Moon Example:
                                                                                                                                                      * Sun = Slower (moves ~1° per day)
                                                                                                                                                      * Moon = Faster (moves ~12-15° per day)
Result:
                                                                                                                                                      * Sun “stays behind” (relative to Moon’s faster motion)
                                                                                                                                                      * Moon “leaves” (creates increasing angular distance)
                                                                                                                                                      * Sun becomes Planet One (the initiating/sending energy)
                                                                                                                                                      * Moon becomes Planet Two (the receiving/responding energy)
Why This Determines Planet One/Two:
From Conjunction to Opposition (0°-180°):
The slower planet (the one that “stays”) becomes Planet One because:
                                                                                                                                                      * It’s the reference point
                                                                                                                                                      * Energy flows FROM it
                                                                                                                                                      * It’s the “sender” in the relationship
The faster planet (the one that “leaves”) becomes Planet Two because:
                                                                                                                                                      * It’s moving away/forward
                                                                                                                                                      * Energy flows TO it
                                                                                                                                                      * It’s the “receiver” in the relationship
Important: This holds true from 0° to 180°. At opposition, roles FLIP (explained in Section 4).
Application to Any Planetary Pair:
Example: Mars-Jupiter Aspect
                                                                                                                                                      * Mars moves faster than Jupiter
                                                                                                                                                      * At conjunction, Jupiter “stays” and Mars “leaves”
                                                                                                                                                      * Jupiter = Planet One (sender)
                                                                                                                                                      * Mars = Planet Two (receiver)
                                                                                                                                                      * From 0° to 180°
Example: Venus-Saturn Aspect
                                                                                                                                                      * Venus moves faster than Saturn
                                                                                                                                                      * At conjunction, Saturn “stays” and Venus “leaves”
                                                                                                                                                      * Saturn = Planet One (sender)
                                                                                                                                                      * Venus = Planet Two (receiver)
                                                                                                                                                      * From 0° to 180°
Then roles switch at opposition (180°), and faster planet becomes Planet One for return journey (180° to 360°/0°).

4. THE 180° RULE: HANDOFF POINTS AND LEADERSHIP SWITCHES
4.1 The Filmmaking Analogy
Direct Quote:
“Now, this is one of the biggest things here is the 180 rule. Now, in filmmaking, the 180 rule is I have person one and person two. And there’s a line, an imaginary line that goes between those two connected people. … The camera always stays on this side of it. The only time the camera would ever move is if we move with the actor and we see the plane cross in the shot. Otherwise, we keep the 180-degree plane. The person on the left is always on the left, they’re always looking right. The person on the right is always on the right, they’re always looking left. As long as we maintain that, it looks perfect.”
Filmmaking 180° Rule Explained:
In cinema, the 180° rule (also called the “axis of action”) maintains spatial continuity:
Setup:
                                                                                                                                                      * Two actors facing each other in conversation
                                                                                                                                                      * An imaginary line connects them
                                                                                                                                                      * Camera must stay on ONE SIDE of that line
Why:
                                                                                                                                                      * Keeps Actor A always on left side of frame
                                                                                                                                                      * Keeps Actor B always on right side of frame
                                                                                                                                                      * Maintains consistent screen direction

If Camera Crosses the Line:
                                                                                                                                                      * Actors suddenly “flip” positions on screen
                                                                                                                                                      * Actor A now appears on right

The Only Acceptable Cross:
                                                                                                                                                      * Camera moves WITH an actor as they cross the line
                                                                                                                                                      * Audience sees the transition happen

4.2 The Astrological 180° Rule
Direct Quote:
“In alchemical astrology, the 180-degree rule is the end of the aspect spectrum for the handoff. It’s at the conjunction. It’s at the opposition. These are the handoff points, and planet 1 and planet 2 are going to switch.”
Astrological Application:
In Aspect Spectrum, the 180° rule defines the TWO HANDOFF POINTS where Planet One and Planet Two roles SWITCH:
Handoff Point 1: Conjunction (0°)
                                                                                                                                                      * Both planets together
                                                                                                                                                      * Journey begins
                                                                                                                                                      * Faster planet starts to pull ahead
                                                                                                                                                      * This establishes which is Planet One (slower/stays) and Planet Two (faster/leaves)
Handoff Point 2: Opposition (180°)
                                                                                                                                                      * Planets at maximum separation
                                                                                                                                                      * Journey reaches midpoint/climax
                                                                                                                                                      * Roles FLIP: Planet Two becomes Planet One; Planet One becomes Planet Two
                                                                                                                                                      * Return journey begins with reversed roles
The Imaginary Line:
Just as in filmmaking, there’s an imaginary line in the chart:
                                                                                                                                                      * Connects the two planets
                                                                                                                                                      * At 0° and 180°, this line is at critical transition
                                                                                                                                                      * Crossing from one side to the other changes perspective
Mathematical Precision:
Direct Quote:
“The aspect spectrum comprises seven major aspects across 12 aspect points, which are the 12 signs, the 12 houses, or, geometrically speaking, the 12 30-degree points. The conjunction begins the journey. The opposition ends it. But in traveling the zodiacal wheel, this leaves us at a midpoint. We’re not done our journey. We’re halfway. Much like a solar lunar opposition of the full moon, we’re only halfway. What are you doing? We got to come all the way back.”
The Cycle:
Outward Journey (0° to 180°):
                                                                                                                                                      * Planet One = Slower planet (sender)
                                                                                                                                                      * Planet Two = Faster planet (receiver)
                                                                                                                                                      * Energy flows FROM Planet One TO Planet Two
                                                                                                                                                      * Aspects: Conjunction → Semi-Sextile → Sextile → Square → Trine → Quincunx → Opposition
Opposition Handoff (180°):
                                                                                                                                                      * Point of Exactitude - Both planets equally supported
                                                                                                                                                      * Roles prepare to switch
                                                                                                                                                      * Faster planet (Planet Two) has now traveled halfway around the wheel
                                                                                                                                                      * About to become the new “sender” for return journey
Return Journey (180° to 360°/0°):
                                                                                                                                                      * Planet One = Faster planet (NOW the sender)
                                                                                                                                                      * Planet Two = Slower planet (NOW the receiver)
                                                                                                                                                      * Energy flows FROM (new) Planet One TO (new) Planet Two
                                                                                                                                                      * Aspects: Opposition → Quincunx → Trine → Square → Sextile → Semi-Sextile → Conjunction
Why This Rule Matters:
Direct Quote:
“Since the roles are switched, the same aspect now presents itself differently due to energy flow, which canonically follows zodiacal directional order. alignments alter and such and as such careful attention to planetary vantage is crucial.”
Example:
Sun-Moon Square (Sun = Planet One, Moon = Planet Two)
Outward Square (90° in outward journey):
                                                                                                                                                      * Sun must work WITH Moon’s needs
                                                                                                                                                      * Focus is on Sun’s purpose including Moon’s emotional requirements
                                                                                                                                                      * Friction comes from Sun trying to ignore Moon
Return Square (270° in return journey):
                                                                                                                                                      * Moon must work WITH Sun’s purpose
                                                                                                                                                      * Focus is on Moon’s needs including Sun’s vitality
                                                                                                                                                      * Friction comes from Moon trying to ignore Sun
Same geometric angle (90°), but completely different energetic dynamic due to which planet is “leading.”

4.3 The Handoff Mechanism at Exact Conjunction
Direct Quote:
“What this means is that the two planets, the one that is planet one and the one that is planet two, are going to switch places. Here, they’re together. The handoff is happening right now. But it hasn’t completed because in this case, the moon, which is the faster planet, has not overtaken the sun. So this is the handoff point, but the handoff has not occurred yet. Right, so they flip leadership positions.”
At Point of Exactitude (0.000°):
When two planets are at the EXACT SAME DEGREE, ARC MINUTE, and ARC SECOND:
Example:
                                                                                                                                                      * Sun at 10° Leo, 5’ 5"
                                                                                                                                                      * Moon at 10° Leo, 5’ 5"
Both planets are EQUALLY SUPPORTED:
Direct Quote:
“Now this part right here, when I say planet one, planet two, remember planet one? thinks it’s not the problem, but actually is. Planet two feels like the problem, but it’s actually the solution. And then you work them together within the aspect. When I say equally supported, You’re going to see this throughout supported. That means that is the energy that we are focusing our efforts into.”
At exact conjunction:
                                                                                                                                                      * Neither leads, neither follows
                                                                                                                                                      * Both must merge equally
                                                                                                                                                      * Cannot prioritize one over the other
                                                                                                                                                      * Perfect fusion point
Immediately After Exactitude:
The moment the faster planet (Moon) moves even 1 arc second ahead:
Direct Quote:
“So in this case, the moon, which is the faster planet, has not overtaken the sun. So this is the handoff point, but the handoff has not occurred yet.”
Once Moon overtakes Sun:
                                                                                                                                                      * Handoff completes
                                                                                                                                                      * Moon is now “ahead” (Planet Two - receiver)
                                                                                                                                                      * Sun is now “behind” (Planet One - sender)
                                                                                                                                                      * Outward journey (0° to 180°) officially begins
The Fraction-of-a-Second Window:
The exact moment of handoff is incredibly brief:
                                                                                                                                                      * At exactitude = Both equal (no Planet One/Two)
                                                                                                                                                      * 1 arc second later = Handoff complete, roles established
This is why precise birth time matters for aspects—a few minutes can determine whether you’re experiencing:
                                                                                                                                                      * The exact conjunction (equal support)
                                                                                                                                                      * Applying toward conjunction (return journey, Moon = Planet One)
                                                                                                                                                      * Separating from conjunction (outward journey, Sun = Planet One)

4.4 The Handoff Mechanism at Exact Opposition
Direct Quote:
“And then finally, in the aspect spectrum, we reach the opposition point of exactitude at 180 degrees… This is the second handoff point switching leadership. So what’s going to happen is that planet one has been the sun. Planet two has been the moon. You’re going to see it flip in just a moment. Because this is a handoff point. This is extremely important. Again, this is the handoff point. The handoff has not happened until a moment after this where the moon continues on its journey.”
At Opposition (Exact 180.000°):
When two planets are EXACTLY 180° apart:
Example:
                                                                                                                                                      * Sun at 10° Aquarius, 5’ 5"
                                                                                                                                                      * Moon at 10° Leo, 5’ 5"
Both planets are EQUALLY SUPPORTED (again):
Direct Quote:
“And then this is the same as the first slide. I just wanted to kind of close it out. This brings us back to the first handoff point, right? So prior, we’re closing it out. We’ve hit the handoff. And as soon as the moon passes the sun again, that’s the handoff. The moon becomes planet one again. I’m sorry, planet two again. The sun becomes planet one and we’re feeding into the sun at that point. But at this point, the point of exactitude, just like the first slide, both are equally supported.”
At exact opposition:
                                                                                                                                                      * Both planets equally important
                                                                                                                                                      * Must work concurrently (not compromise, but balance)
                                                                                                                                                      * Neither leads, both contribute simultaneously
                                                                                                                                                      * Perfect awareness/completion point
The Critical Reversal:
Immediately AFTER exact opposition:
As Moon continues forward past 180.000°:
Direct Quote:
“After that, the moon takes the lead and becomes planet one, and the sun becomes planet two. … From here, we’re descending in an aspect order. So instead of going from the conjunction to the opposition, now we’re returning from the opposition back to the conjunction, where each planet still has the same relationship, but one planet is in the lead instead of the other, which reverses how you play this out.”
New Dynamic (180° to 360°/0°):
                                                                                                                                                      * Moon (faster planet) is now Planet One (sender/leader)
                                                                                                                                                      * Sun (slower planet) is now Planet Two (receiver/solution)
                                                                                                                                                      * Energy flow REVERSES direction
                                                                                                                                                      * Same aspects, different roles
Why This Changes Everything:
Direct Quote:
“So most of this the sun has been In perception, the sun has been, oh, I’m good. The moon as planet two is the problem. The reality is planet one’s the problem. It’s not aligned with planet two, which is the solution. Now it’s going to go the other way around. Now the moon is going to be planet one. It is going to feel like it’s in the right, and the sun’s going to feel like the problem, when in reality, the moon has to align with the sun for resolution.”
Perception Flip:
Outward Journey (0°-180°):
                                                                                                                                                      * Sun thinks: “I’m fine, Moon is the problem”
                                                                                                                                                      * Reality: Sun must align with Moon
Return Journey (180°-360°):
                                                                                                                                                      * Moon thinks: “I’m fine, Sun is the problem”
                                                                                                                                                      * Reality: Moon must align with Sun
The Midpoint Realization:
Direct Quote:
“But in traveling the zodiacal wheel, this leaves us at a midpoint. We’re not done our journey. We’re halfway. Much like a solar lunar opposition of the full moon, we’re only halfway. What are you doing? We got to come all the way back.”
The opposition is NOT the end—it’s the turning point. Like a Full Moon, you’ve reached maximum illumination/awareness, but the cycle must complete by returning to conjunction.
The Return Must Happen:
Just as the Moon must wane back to New Moon, any planetary aspect must complete the full 360° cycle:
                                                                                                                                                      * Can’t stay at opposition forever
                                                                                                                                                      * Must integrate the awareness gained
                                                                                                                                                      * Must return to conjunction for new cycle to begin
This creates a complete developmental arc rather than a simple linear progression.

4.5 Careful Attention to Planetary Vantage
Direct Quote:
“Since the roles are switched, the same aspect now presents itself differently due to energy flow, which canonically follows zodiacal directional order. alignments alter and such and as such careful attention to planetary vantage is crucial planet one remains the problem planet two remains the solution.”
“Planetary Vantage” Defined:
Vantage = The perspective or viewpoint from which you’re analyzing the aspect
Two Possible Vantages:
Vantage 1: Reading from Planet One
                                                                                                                                                      * “How is Planet One experiencing this aspect?”
                                                                                                                                                      * “What does Planet One need to adjust?”
                                                                                                                                                      * “How should Planet One align with Planet Two?”
Vantage 2: Reading from Planet Two
                                                                                                                                                      * “How is Planet Two receiving Planet One’s energy?”
                                                                                                                                                      * “What is Planet Two’s reality being built from?”
                                                                                                                                                      * “How does Planet Two need to respond?”
Connection to Reverse Vantage Technique:
This connects to Transcript 9 (Reverse Vantage Webinar):
Traditional Astrology: Only reads aspects from Planet One’s perspective
Alchemistic Astrology: Reads aspects from BOTH perspectives:
                                                                                                                                                      * Forward Vantage - From Planet One (sender)
                                                                                                                                                      * Reverse Vantage - From Planet Two (receiver)
Why Vantage Matters for 180° Rule:
Because Planet One/Two roles FLIP at opposition:
Outward Journey (0°-180°):
                                                                                                                                                      * Reading from Sun’s vantage
                                                                                                                                                      * Sun is sending, Moon is receiving
                                                                                                                                                      * Interpretation focuses on Sun’s adjustment toward Moon
Return Journey (180°-360°):
                                                                                                                                                      * Now reading from Moon’s vantage
                                                                                                                                                      * Moon is sending, Sun is receiving
                                                                                                                                                      * Interpretation focuses on Moon’s adjustment toward Sun
Practical Example:
Sun Square Moon (Outward - 90°):
                                                                                                                                                      * From Sun’s vantage: “My purpose/will (Sun) feels blocked by emotional needs (Moon). I must learn to INCLUDE Moon’s needs in my self-expression.”
Moon Square Sun (Return - 270°):
                                                                                                                                                      * From Moon’s vantage: “My emotional safety (Moon) feels threatened by purpose/will (Sun). I must learn to INCLUDE Sun’s vitality in my emotional world.”
Same square geometry, completely different lived experience depending on vantage.
Critical Practice:
Direct Quote:
“careful attention to planetary vantage is crucial.”
When reading any aspect, always ask:
                                                                                                                                                      1. Which planet is Planet One? (sender/problem/needs to adjust)
                                                                                                                                                      2. Which planet is Planet Two? (receiver/solution/alignment target)
                                                                                                                                                      3. Are we on outward journey (0°-180°) or return journey (180°-360°)?
                                                                                                                                                      4. Has the handoff occurred yet?
This level of precision is what separates superficial aspect interpretation from the deep, nuanced Aspect Spectrum approach.

5.2 Perception vs Reality Framework
THE FUNDAMENTAL MISUNDERSTANDING:
Direct Quote:
“The perception in this. is how you can expect this energy to play out which like i said usually causes a problem because when we get down to planet one and planet two planet one’s the problem planet two is the solution but The way in our perception is that we think that planet one has the right of way and that planet two is the problem, when in reality, that’s not the way it actually works.”
The Perception (How It Feels):
From Planet One’s perspective:
                                                                                                                                                      * “I’m doing things right”
                                                                                                                                                      * “Planet Two is blocking me / causing problems”
                                                                                                                                                      * “If only Planet Two would change/cooperate, everything would be fine”
                                                                                                                                                      * “I have the right of way”
From Planet Two’s perspective:
                                                                                                                                                      * “Something feels wrong”
                                                                                                                                                      * “I’m being impacted by Planet One”
                                                                                                                                                      * “I’m the problem in this situation”
                                                                                                                                                      * “I need to adjust or get out of the way”
The Reality (How It Actually Works):
Direct Quote:
“The reality is planet one’s the problem. It’s not aligned with planet two, which is the solution.”
Actual Dynamic:
                                                                                                                                                      * Planet One is NOT in the right—it’s misaligned
                                                                                                                                                      * Planet Two is NOT the problem—it’s the solution
                                                                                                                                                      * Planet One must ADJUST toward Planet Two
                                                                                                                                                      * Resolution happens when Planet One INCLUDES/ALIGNS WITH Planet Two
Why The Confusion?
Supported = Feels Right:
Direct Quote:
“Planet 1 is the one that’s supported. We’re doing it for the actions of the first planet, not for the actions of the second.”
Planet One gets the support and focus in the aspect:
                                                                                                                                                      * More energy flows through it
                                                                                                                                                      * More attention given to it
                                                                                                                                                      * More consciousness around it
This makes Planet One FEEL like it’s the important one, the “right” one.
But:
Being supported doesn’t mean being correct—it means “this is where the work needs to happen.”
Plant One is supported BECAUSE it’s the one that needs to learn/adjust.

5.3 The Energy Flow Direction
Direct Quote:
“So the sun needs to direct the shine for its own purposes into the needs of the moon to work together again to serve what the sun is trying to do.”
Unidirectional Flow:
Energy flows FROM Planet One TO Planet Two:
Planet One → Planet Two
NOT:

Directional Clarification:
Direct Quote:
“It only goes in one direction, though. So it doesn’t go from moon back. It only reacts from moon back.”
The Mechanism:
Planet One (Sender):
                                                                                                                                                      * Initiates the energy
                                                                                                                                                      * Directs its influence
                                                                                                                                                      * Aims toward Planet Two
Planet Two (Receiver):
                                                                                                                                                      * Receives the energy
                                                                                                                                                      * Responds/reacts
                                                                                                                                                      * Cannot send energy back the same way
The Reactive Response:
Direct Quote:
“So if the sun is there and it’s not delivering properly to the moon, the moon gets unsettled. And that’s where that reactive energy happens. Second planet, the moon, that’s what’s supported.”
Planet Two’s Response:
If Planet One sends misaligned energy:
                                                                                                                                                      * Planet Two becomes unsettled
                                                                                                                                                      * Planet Two reacts (gets emotional, resistant, disrupted)
                                                                                                                                                      * This REACTION signals to Planet One: “This isn’t working”
But Planet Two cannot initiate the solution—it can only:
                                                                                                                                                      1. Receive what Planet One sends
                                                                                                                                                      2. React if it’s misaligned
                                                                                                                                                      3. Integrate if it’s properly aligned
Example:
Sun Square Moon (Planet One = Sun, Planet Two = Moon)
Misaligned (Perception):
                                                                                                                                                      * Sun: “I’m going to pursue my goals regardless of emotional needs”
                                                                                                                                                      * Sun sends willful, emotionally-disconnected energy → Moon
                                                                                                                                                      * Moon receives this, feels unsafe/unsupported
                                                                                                                                                      * Moon reacts: anxiety, emotional overwhelm, shutdown
Aligned (Reality):
                                                                                                                                                      * Sun: “I’m going to pursue my goals in a way that HONORS emotional needs”
                                                                                                                                                      * Sun sends purpose-driven but emotionally-attuned energy → Moon
                                                                                                                                                      * Moon receives this, feels safe/included
                                                                                                                                                      * Moon responds: emotional support, confidence, security
Same square, completely different outcome based on Sun’s alignment with Moon’s needs.

5.4 Which Planet Is Supported?
Direct Quote:
“This is going to be very important within the aspect spectra because, when you have an aspect, one planet, unless it’s at a point of exactitude, one planet is actually the one that we’re leaning into to support it to be able to move forward with whatever we’re trying to do, especially from the vantage point, in this case, of planet one.”
Support = Focus of Consciousness:
“Supported” means:
                                                                                                                                                      * Where you direct your conscious effort
                                                                                                                                                      * Which planet’s needs get primary attention
                                                                                                                                                      * The energy you’re actively working with
                                                                                                                                                      * The planet you’re “doing it for”


General Rule:
From 0° to 180° (Outward Journey):

                                                                                                                                                      * Focus on Planet One’s adjustment toward Planet Two
                                                                                                                                                      * “Doing it for Planet One’s purposes”
From 180° to 360° (Return Journey):
                                                                                                                                                      * Planet Two becomes Planet One (now the sender)
                                                                                                                                                      * Focus shifts to (new) Planet One’s adjustment
                                                                                                                                                      * “Doing it for (new) Planet One’s purposes”

Practical Application:
Example: Sun at 10° Leo, Moon at 12° Scorpio
                                                                                                                                                      * Geometric separation: ~27° (semi-sextile approaching sextile)

                                                                                                                                                      * Sun is supported - Focus on Sun adjusting toward Moon’s needs
Example: Sun at 10° Leo, Moon at 10° Aquarius
                                                                                                                                                      * Geometric separation: exactly 180° (opposition at exactitude)
                                                                                                                                                      * Both equally supported - Must work concurrently
Example: Sun at 10° Leo, Moon at 8° Aquarius
                                                                                                                                                      * Geometric separation: ~178° (approaching opposition)
                                                                                                                                                      * Still technically Planet One = Sun, but…
                                                                                                                                                      * Both increasingly supported - Nearing handoff point, must prepare for role reversal

5.5 The Turnover Point
Direct Quote:
“In the spectrum, the favor is going to switch. So while the sun remains planet one and the moon remains planet two, what you’re going to see next right here is separating beyond 90 degrees—this is that. It’s not for the sun anymore. It is for the moon.”
The Turnover Point Defined:
The moment within an aspect (especially square) when the focus/favor shifts from Planet One to Planet Two, even though the roles haven’t officially switched yet.
Key Distinction:
                                                                                                                                                      * Handoff Point (0° and 180°) = Roles officially switch (Planet One ↔ Planet Two)
                                                                                                                                                      * Turnover Point (especially 90°) = Support/favor shifts before role switch
At Square (90°):
Applying Toward 90° (0° → 90°):
                                                                                                                                                      * Planet One still supported
                                                                                                                                                      * “Doing it for Planet One’s purposes”
                                                                                                                                                      * Planet Two must be included, but Planet One leads
Exact 90.000°:
                                                                                                                                                      * Both equally supported
                                                                                                                                                      * Perfect friction point requiring equal use
Separating Beyond 90° (90° → 180°):
                                                                                                                                                      * Favor shifts to Planet Two
                                                                                                                                                      * Still technically Planet One = slower planet, but…
                                                                                                                                                      * “Now it’s for Planet Two’s purposes”
                                                                                                                                                      * Planet One must now serve Planet Two’s journey toward opposition
Direct Quote:
“Once the square hits the point of exactitude… both are in favor at the same exact time. … And the closer you are to exactitude, the more equal it has to be. … The turnover point is where planet A will shift to planet B. The favor is going to switch.”
Why This Matters:
Same Square, Different Focus:
Sun 85° from Moon (approaching 90°):
                                                                                                                                                      * Sun is supported
                                                                                                                                                      * “How can Sun’s vitality INCLUDE Moon’s emotional needs?”
                                                                                                                                                      * Focus on Sun’s adjustment
Sun exactly 90° from Moon:
                                                                                                                                                      * Both equally supported
                                                                                                                                                      * “Both Sun’s vitality AND Moon’s emotional needs must work together equally”
                                                                                                                                                      * Neither has priority
Sun 95° from Moon (separating beyond 90°):
                                                                                                                                                      * Moon now favored (even though Sun still technically Planet One)
                                                                                                                                                      * “How can Moon’s emotional needs RECEIVE Sun’s vitality?”
                                                                                                                                                      * Focus shifts toward Moon’s journey to opposition
This creates THREE phases within the square:
                                                                                                                                                      1. Applying (Sun-focused)
                                                                                                                                                      2. Exact (Both equal)
                                                                                                                                                      3. Separating (Moon-focused)

5.6 No Planet Can Be Neglected
Direct Quote:
“No planet could be neglected in the relationship. Let’s continue our adventure. A lot of times when we say focus on planet one, focus on planet two, you might drop one planet and then you’re losing the relationship between the aspects. This is about focus and where we’re directing it and which planet is supported at the time.”
Common Mistake:
When students learn “Planet One is the problem, Planet Two is the solution,” they often:
                                                                                                                                                      * Focus ONLY on Planet One (trying to “fix” it)
                                                                                                                                                      * OR focus ONLY on Planet Two (trying to “align” with it)
                                                                                                                                                      * Ignore the other planet entirely
The Correction:
Both planets must remain active in consciousness:
Planet One:
                                                                                                                                                      * Yes, it needs adjustment
                                                                                                                                                      * Yes, it’s the “problem”
                                                                                                                                                      * But it’s also the SOURCE of the energy
                                                                                                                                                      * It can’t disappear or be suppressed
Planet Two:
                                                                                                                                                      * Yes, it’s the “solution”
                                                                                                                                                      * Yes, it’s what Planet One aligns with
                                                                                                                                                      * But it’s RECEIVING, not replacing
                                                                                                                                                      * It needs Planet One’s energy to function
The Relationship Is the Point:
Direct Quote:
“This is about focus and where we’re directing it and which planet is supported at the time.”
Aspect interpretation isn’t about:
                                                                                                                                                      * Choosing one planet over another
                                                                                                                                                      * Suppressing the “problem” planet
                                                                                                                                                      * Exalting the “solution” planet
It’s about:
                                                                                                                                                      * Directing focus appropriately
                                                                                                                                                      * Using both planets simultaneously
                                                                                                                                                      * Adjusting the relationship between them
Example:
Mars Square Saturn
Wrong Approach #1: Suppress Mars
                                                                                                                                                      * “Saturn is the solution, so I’ll stop taking action (Mars)”
                                                                                                                                                      * Result: Stagnation, frustration, passive-aggressive behavior
Wrong Approach #2: Ignore Saturn
                                                                                                                                                      * “Mars is supported, so I’ll just act without structure (Saturn)”
                                                                                                                                                      * Result: Reckless action, wasted energy, burnout
Right Approach: Adjust the Relationship
                                                                                                                                                      * “Mars wants to act (Planet One/supported), and must do so WITHIN Saturn’s structure (Planet Two/solution)”
                                                                                                                                                      * Result: Disciplined action, strategic effort, sustainable achievement
Both planets remain active—the relationship between them shifts.

5.7 Planet One/Two in Different Aspects
The Same Principles Apply, but Flavor Changes:
Conjunction (0°):
                                                                                                                                                      * Neither is Planet One/Two at exactitude

Then roles flip, and the return journey mirrors these dynamics in reverse.

6. COMPLETE ASPECT BREAKDOWN: THE JOURNEY THROUGH THE SPECTRUM
6.1 Conjunction (0°): The Merger
Direct Quote:
“The conjunction point, this is the first one. This is where we embark on the journey. These two planets… And there are different types of conjunctions that you’re going to see here. But the initiator is going to be in this journey, the conjunction at what we call the point of exactitude. This means one is not in the lead. They are literally there. 10 degrees, 5 minutes, 5 arc seconds for the sun, then it is also 10 degrees, 5 arc minutes, 5 arc seconds for the moon. It is the exact point where they are conjunct. Neither one is in front of the other.”
Geometric Definition:
                                                                                                                                                      * 0° separation between two planets
                                                                                                                                                      * Same degree, same sign, same house (at exactitude)
                                                                                                                                                      * Beginning of aspect spectrum journey
Point of Exactitude:
When planets are at EXACTLY the same position:
                                                                                                                                                      * Sun at 10° Aries, 5’ 5"
                                                                                                                                                      * Moon at 10° Aries, 5’ 5"
Direct Quote:
“So the perception, the way that you see this— is that the sun wants to shine. The moon can feel like it’s restricting the sun from doing what it wants to, but both of them are being forced to share the same space.”
PERCEPTION:
How the conjunction feels naturally:
                                                                                                                                                      * Competition for space - “Both want to express but feel crowded”
                                                                                                                                                      * One restricts the other - “Moon feels like it’s limiting Sun’s ability to shine”
                                                                                                                                                      * Forced proximity - “Can’t get away from each other”
                                                                                                                                                      * Confusion of identity - “Where does one planet end and the other begin?”
REALITY:
Direct Quote:
“Now this part right here, when I say planet one, planet two, remember planet one? thinks it’s not the problem, but actually is. Planet two feels like the problem, but it’s actually the solution. And then you work them together within the aspect. When I say equally supported, You’re going to see this throughout supported. That means that is the energy that we are focusing our efforts into.”
What the conjunction actually requires:
                                                                                                                                                      * Neither is Planet One or Planet Two (at exactitude)
                                                                                                                                                      * Both equally supported - Can’t prioritize one
                                                                                                                                                      * Complete merger required - Not cooperation, FUSION
                                                                                                                                                      * Accept each other’s presence - Must resolve as ONE unified energy
The Conjunction Types:
Direct Quote:
“So when you read your chart, it’s like, ‘Oh, I have a conjunction. That’s not enough. There’s way more going on in your chart than just a conjunction.’ Which planets first? Is it applying? Is it separating? What planets are involved? All of that’s important.”
Three Types of Conjunction:
1. Applying Conjunction (Approaching from 360° side):
                                                                                                                                                      * Faster planet (Planet One on return journey) approaching slower planet
                                                                                                                                                      * About to complete cycle
                                                                                                                                                      * “Coming back together” energy
2. Exact Conjunction (0.000°):
                                                                                                                                                      * Perfect merger
                                                                                                                                                      * Both equally supported
                                                                                                                                                      * Handoff point
3. Separating Conjunction (Moving toward 30° side):
                                                                                                                                                      * Faster planet pulling ahead
                                                                                                                                                      * Journey beginning
                                                                                                                                                      * Planet One/Two roles now established
Integration Requirement:
Direct Quote:
“Now, what’s actually happening here is the sun and the moon’s energies, they’re meshing together evenly. Both must accept each other’s presence and resolve as one…”
Resolution Strategy:
                                                                                                                                                      1. Acknowledge both energies - Neither can be suppressed
                                                                                                                                                      2. Find the unified expression - How do these planets create ONE blended energy?
                                                                                                                                                      3. Stop separating them - Don’t say “my Sun wants this, my Moon wants that”—find what “I want” when both are merged
Example: Sun Conjunct Neptune
Perception:
                                                                                                                                                      * Sun (ego/will) feels diluted by Neptune (dissolution)
                                                                                                                                                      * Neptune’s sensitivity feels overwhelmed by Sun’s intensity
                                                                                                                                                      * Struggle to maintain clear boundaries
Reality:
                                                                                                                                                      * Must merge vitality WITH spirituality
                                                                                                                                                      * Create unified identity: “spiritual warrior” or “inspired creator”
                                                                                                                                                      * Cannot separate ego from transcendence—they’re ONE energy

6.2 Semi-Sextile (30°): The Blind Spot
Direct Quote:
“Now we’re moving away. Now we’ve reached past some minor aspects, and now we’re into the 30-degree semi-sextile relationship. And the sun feels it cannot shine because of the 30-degree relationship with the moon. … This produces a hard stop or a reason why the sun feels stagnated… the reality is that the moon has reached a 30 degree advancement into an area the sun doesn’t understand… It’s a conflict between here and there. It’s kind of like a blind spot.”
Geometric Definition:
                                                                                                                                                      * 30° separation between two planets
                                                                                                                                                      * One sign away from each other
                                                                                                                                                      * First major separation from conjunction
PERCEPTION:

How the semi-sextile feels:
                                                                                                                                                      * Hard stop - “I’m blocked but don’t know why”
                                                                                                                                                      * Stagnation - “I can’t move forward”
                                                                                                                                                      * Blind spot - “I sense something there but can’t see it clearly”
                                                                                                                                                      * Subtle friction - “Not overt conflict, but something’s off”
REALITY:
Direct Quote:
“the reality is that the moon has reached a 30 degree advancement into an area the sun doesn’t understand… It’s a conflict between here and there. It’s kind of like a blind spot. The moon’s new needs need to act as a next step for the sun to know where to shine properly.”
What the semi-sextile actually represents:
                                                                                                                                                      * Planet Two has moved to new territory - Moon is now in a different area than Sun
                                                                                                                                                      * Planet One doesn’t understand this area yet - Sun hasn’t experienced where Moon is
                                                                                                                                                      * Planet Two’s needs are the next step - Moon shows Sun where to go next
                                                                                                                                                      * Awareness without full comprehension - Can sense but not yet see clearly
The Blind Spot Metaphor:
Like a car’s blind spot:
                                                                                                                                                      * You know something’s there (feel the energy)
                                                                                                                                                      * You can’t see it directly (don’t understand it)
                                                                                                                                                      * It can cause accidents if ignored (creates problems)
                                                                                                                                                      * Must consciously check/adjust (requires intentional awareness)
Adjacent Sign Challenge:
The semi-sextile typically connects signs that:
                                                                                                                                                      * Share no element (e.g., Aries fire → Taurus earth)
                                                                                                                                                      * Share no modality (e.g., Aries cardinal → Taurus fixed)
                                                                                                                                                      * Have completely different energetic signatures
Example: Aries → Taurus Semi-Sextile
                                                                                                                                                      * Aries: Fast, impulsive, initiating
                                                                                                                                                      * Taurus: Slow, deliberate, stabilizing
                                                                                                                                                      * Aries can’t understand WHY Taurus needs to slow down
                                                                                                                                                      * Taurus is now in territory (stability/sensuality) that Aries hasn’t reached
                                                                                                                                                      * Taurus’s presence creates “hard stop” for Aries’s forward momentum

                                                                                                                                                      2. Use it as guidance - Planet Two shows where you’re heading next
                                                                                                                                                      3. Don’t fight the stop - The stagnation is purposeful
                                                                                                                                                      4. Prepare to move into new territory - You’re about to enter Planet Two’s domain
Example: Sun Semi-Sextile Moon
Sun at 15° Aries, Moon at 15° Taurus:
Perception:
                                                                                                                                                      * Sun: “I want to act NOW but something’s blocking me”
                                                                                                                                                      * Feels frustrated, stagnated
                                                                                                                                                      * Can’t see what Moon needs
Reality:
                                                                                                                                                      * Moon has moved into stabilizing/grounding territory (Taurus)
                                                                                                                                                      * Moon’s needs (security, patience, pleasure) are the NEXT STEP for Sun
                                                                                                                                                      * Sun must learn: “My vitality will shine MORE BRIGHTLY when I incorporate stability”

6.3 Sextile (60°): The Partnership
Direct Quote:
“The sextiles, the next one on the stop, we hit 60 degrees away. And what ends up happening is the sun sees the moon. I know you’re there, but doesn’t really know to what degree the moon matters. And sometimes it can feel not like a hard stop, but like I’m trying to do something, but that thing’s kind of getting in the way. … It’s a partnership buddy-buddy type of aspect. I need to include that in what I’m doing.”

How the sextile feels:

                                                                                                                                                      * Mild interference - “You’re sort of in the way (not blocking, just… there)”

                                                                                                                                                      * Underestimated importance - “Doesn’t really know to what degree the moon matters”
REALITY:
Direct Quote:
“It’s a partnership buddy-buddy type of aspect. I need to include that in what I’m doing. … There is an assumption that the sun is already included, that we’re already, this is already done. But we’re not talking about the moon. We’re talking about the sun. … So understanding where the moon is, you bring that back into the sun. The sun can shine by including the moon and saying, okay, we’re bringing this along…”
What the sextile actually represents:
                                                                                                                                                      * Partnership opportunity - “We can work together productively”
                                                                                                                                                      * Requires conscious inclusion - Not automatic, must choose to engage
                                                                                                                                                      * Supportive cooperation - “Buddy-buddy” dynamic, not forced
                                                                                                                                                      * Effort needed despite harmony - Won’t happen on its own
The “Already Done” Trap:
Direct Quote:
“There is an assumption that the sun is already included, that we’re already, this is already done.”
Because sextiles are “harmonious,” people assume:
                                                                                                                                                      * “This is already working”
                                                                                                                                                      * “No effort needed”
                                                                                                                                                      * “It’s naturally cooperative”
But this misses the point:
Planet One is supported (Sun), but it must consciously choose to include Planet Two (Moon). The cooperation is AVAILABLE, not AUTOMATIC.
The Car Ride Example:
Direct Quote:
“I hop in my car and I go drive… my wife is coming with me… she says we need to go to the store.”
Sextile dynamic:
                                                                                                                                                      * Sun = driving somewhere (has a plan)
                                                                                                                                                      * Moon = coming along (cooperative presence)
                                                                                                                                                      * Moon mentions: “We need to go to the store”
                                                                                                                                                      * Sun must CHOOSE to include that need: “Okay, we’re bringing this along”
If Sun ignores Moon’s request:
                                                                                                                                                      * Moon feels unsupported
                                                                                                                                                      * Sun misses opportunity for productive cooperation
                                                                                                                                                      * Sextile potential wasted
Resolution Strategy:
                                                                                                                                                      1. Acknowledge Planet Two’s presence - Don’t dismiss as unimportant
                                                                                                                                                      2. Actively include it in your plans - Make conscious effort
                                                                                                                                                      3. Recognize it as SUPPORT, not interference - Planet Two wants to help
                                                                                                                                                      4. Bring it along for the ride - Integrate its needs into your journey
Example: Mercury Sextile Venus
Mercury at 15° Gemini, Venus at 15° Leo:
Perception:
                                                                                                                                                      * Mercury (communication/thinking) is doing its thing
                                                                                                                                                      * Vaguely aware Venus (values/relationships) is there
                                                                                                                                                      * “Do I need to consider relationships while communicating?”
Reality:
                                                                                                                                                      * Venus offers SUPPORT to Mercury’s communication
                                                                                                                                                      * Communication becomes MORE EFFECTIVE when charm/diplomacy included
                                                                                                                                                      * Must consciously say: “I’ll communicate (Mercury) in a way that honors relationships (Venus)”
Integration:
                                                                                                                                                      * Before speaking, ask: “How can I say this with grace/diplomacy?”
                                                                                                                                                      * Include Venus’s relational awareness in Mercury’s mental processes
                                                                                                                                                      * Result: Charming, effective, relationship-building communication

6.4 Square (90°): The Forced Integration
Direct Quote:
“So the square is the one that most people are like, I understand that there’s friction. I understand that there is tension, conflict, but I don’t know why. … The perception, the way that it feels, is that the sun is in conflict with the moon and wants to challenge it to overtake it.’ … 'The reality is that the moon is at a cross point from the sun. And they’re at an angle that creates conflict when not properly managed equally. This is the key word, equally.”

                                                                                                                                                      * Equal use required - Like a conjunction, BOTH must be active
                                                                                                                                                      * Managed conflict - Tension is constructive when properly handled
                                                                                                                                                      * Building opportunity - “from there, we get to build things magically”
The Equal Support Requirement:
Direct Quote:
“They’re both coming at it from different angles, and instead of the first angle saying, I’m going to overtake the second one, it’s like, no, no, no, respect me. This is what I need. Just as much as you need this, I need this. We’re coming at it from different approaches. And from there, we get to build things magically. That’s what the square is all about.”
Both planets must be honored simultaneously:
                                                                                                                                                      * Not “Sun OR Moon”
                                                                                                                                                      * Not “Sun dominates Moon”
                                                                                                                                                      * Not “Compromise between Sun and Moon”
                                                                                                                                                      * “Sun AND Moon, coming from different angles, building together”
The Three Phases of Square:
Phase 1: Applying Toward 90°
Direct Quote:
“But applying towards 90. you’re still doing it for the purposes of the sun.”
                                                                                                                                                      * Planet One (Sun) is supported
                                                                                                                                                      * Friction builds as square approaches
                                                                                                                                                      * Purpose: Sun must learn to INCLUDE Moon equally
                                                                                                                                                      * Focus: “How can Sun’s goals incorporate Moon’s needs?”
Phase 2: Exact 90.000°
Direct Quote:
“Once the square hits the point of exactitude… both are in favor at the same exact time. … And the closer you are to exactitude, the more equal it has to be.”
                                                                                                                                                      * Both planets equally supported
                                                                                                                                                      * Maximum friction point
                                                                                                                                                      * Neither can dominate
                                                                                                                                                      * Requires perfect balance of both energies
Phase 3: Separating Beyond 90°
Direct Quote:
“Separating beyond 90 degrees—this is that. It’s not for the sun anymore. It is for the moon… The sun is lending its services… to support whatever the moon needs.”
                                                                                                                                                      * Favor shifts to Planet Two (Moon)
                                                                                                                                                      * Sun now SERVES Moon’s journey
                                                                                                                                                      * Purpose: Moon continues toward opposition with Sun’s support
                                                                                                                                                      * Focus: “How can Moon’s needs be supported by Sun’s vitality?”
The Turnover:
Direct Quote:
“The turnover point is where planet A will shift to planet B. The favor is going to switch.”
The square (90°) is the TURNOVER POINT:
                                                                                                                                                      * Before 90°: Planet One supported
                                                                                                                                                      * At 90°: Both equal
                                                                                                                                                      * After 90°: Planet Two favored (even though still Planet Two until opposition)
Resolution Strategy:
Direct Quote:
“That’s why the square is so damn challenging, but nobody brings this up. Because not only do I have to know what I’m sending, I have to understand how I’m receiving it and whether I’m ready to receive it.”
                                                                                                                                                      1. Stop trying to “win” - Neither planet should overtake the other
                                                                                                                                                      2. Use both equally - Like a conjunction, merge the energies
                                                                                                                                                      3. Come from different angles - Respect that they approach differently
                                                                                                                                                      4. Build together - Use the friction constructively
                                                                                                                                                      5. Adjust focus as square progresses - Support shifts from Planet One → Both → Planet Two
Example: Mars Square Saturn
Mars at 15° Aries, Saturn at 15° Capricorn:
Perception:
                                                                                                                                                      * Mars (action) feels BLOCKED by Saturn (structure/limitation)
                                                                                                                                                      * Wants to fight Saturn, overcome it, prove it wrong
                                                                                                                                                      * Frustration, anger, “I can’t do anything!”
Reality:

                                                                                                                                                      * Both must be used EQUALLY
                                                                                                                                                      * Mars provides drive/energy; Saturn provides discipline/structure
                                                                                                                                                      * Together they build SUSTAINABLE ACHIEVEMENT
Integration (Applying):
                                                                                                                                                      * Mars (supported): “I will take action (Mars) but within structured parameters (Saturn)”
                                                                                                                                                      * Build disciplined action plans
                                                                                                                                                      * Channel raw energy into strategic effort
Integration (Separating):
                                                                                                                                                      * Saturn (favored): “I will maintain structure (Saturn) energized by drive (Mars)”
                                                                                                                                                      * Don’t let structures become rigid—keep them dynamic
                                                                                                                                                      * Use Mars’s energy to serve Saturn’s long-term goals
Result:
                                                                                                                                                      * Not Mars without Saturn (reckless action)
                                                                                                                                                      * Not Saturn without Mars (stagnant structure)
                                                                                                                                                      * Mars + Saturn together = Strategic, disciplined, effective achievement

6.5 Trine (120°): The Unimpeded Flow
Direct Quote:
“When we get to the trine, this is the one that everybody thinks is so easy. … The perception is that the sun directly contributes to the moon. And this is a 120-degree angle, it seems to come very naturally and typically goes unnoticed because you’re not actively doing anything.”
Geometric Definition:
                                                                                                                                                      * 120° separation between two planets
                                                                                                                                                      * Four signs away from each other
                                                                                                                                                      * Same element (fire-fire, earth-earth, air-air, water-water)
PERCEPTION:
Direct Quote:
“The perception is that the sun directly contributes to the moon. And this is a 120-degree angle, it seems to come very naturally and typically goes unnoticed because you’re not actively doing anything.”
How the trine feels:
                                                                                                                                                      * Easy flow - “This just works”
                                                                                                                                                      * Natural contribution - “Energy transfers smoothly”
                                                                                                                                                      * Goes unnoticed - So natural you don’t think about it
                                                                                                                                                      * No active effort - “I’m not doing anything and it still works”
REALITY:
Direct Quote:
“The reality of a trine is much deeper. It’s that the moon is a receiver for the sun. Whatever energy comes from the sun, it does indeed affect the moon without interruption. However, without intentional alignment, the sun can distort or disrupt that flow. The moon can receive something it doesn’t want, or … gives it the feels of being insecure, unsafe, and feeling like there’s no emotional security foundation.”
What the trine actually represents:
                                                                                                                                                      * Unimpeded reception - Energy flows WITHOUT INTERRUPTION
                                                                                                                                                      * Not automatic harmony - Requires INTENTIONAL ALIGNMENT
                                                                                                                                                      * Can distort/disrupt - If Sun sends misaligned energy, Moon receives it fully (including the problem)
                                                                                                                                                      * Receiver vulnerability - Moon can’t block what Sun sends
The Trine Trap:
Direct Quote:
“That’s why trines are so damn challenging, but nobody brings this up. Because not only do I have to know what I’m sending, I have to understand how I’m receiving it and whether I’m ready to receive it.”
Traditional view: “Trines are lucky, easy, always positive”
Aspect Spectrum view: “Trines transmit EVERYTHING unfiltered—if Planet One sends poorly aimed energy, Planet Two receives the full force of it”
The Complacency Risk:
Because trines feel easy:
                                                                                                                                                      * People don’t pay attention to them
                                                                                                                                                      * Assume they’re “already working”
                                                                                                                                                      * Don’t consciously direct the energy
                                                                                                                                                      * Miss the fact that Planet Two might be overwhelmed
The Heart Connection:
Direct Quote:
“If there’s something wrong … it affects the heart.”
Trines often involve emotional vulnerability:
                                                                                                                                                      * Energy flows directly to core
                                                                                                                                                      * No friction to slow it down
                                                                                                                                                      * If misaligned, it hurts DEEPLY
                                                                                                                                                      * More painful than expected because there’s no defense
Resolution Strategy:
Direct Quote:
“The moon must be in a stable position to direct its focus into the sun, and it must know what the sun’s purposes are also so it’s supportive instead of detracting. The sun needs to be open to an understanding of the reception, the energy the moon is pushing in.”
                                                                                                                                                      1. Conscious direction required - Planet One must AIM intentionally
                                                                                                                                                      2. Check Planet Two’s readiness - Is it prepared to receive?
                                                                                                                                                      3. Ensure alignment - Is what’s being sent what’s needed?
                                                                                                                                                      4. Don’t assume it’s working - Just because it’s flowing doesn’t mean it’s helpful
                                                                                                                                                      5. Planet Two must communicate - Let Planet One know what’s being received
Example: Sun Trine Moon
Sun at 15° Leo, Moon at 15° Sagittarius:
Perception:
                                                                                                                                                      * “Sun and Moon naturally support each other”
                                                                                                                                                      * “This feels easy, no work needed”
                                                                                                                                                      * “Ego and emotions are in harmony”
Reality:
                                                                                                                                                      * Sun sends vitality energy → Moon WITHOUT INTERRUPTION
                                                                                                                                                      * If Sun is sending grandiose/ego-driven energy, Moon receives FULL FORCE
                                                                                                                                                      * Moon might feel overwhelmed by Sun’s intensity
                                                                                                                                                      * OR Moon might inflate Sun’s ego without grounding
Misaligned Trine:
                                                                                                                                                      * Sun (Planet One): “I’m amazing, I can do anything!” (sending inflated energy)
                                                                                                                                                      * Moon (Planet Two): Receives this, feels unsafe (“This is too much, where’s the security?”)
                                                                                                                                                      * Result: Emotional instability despite “easy” aspect
Aligned Trine:
                                                                                                                                                      * Sun: “I will shine vitality in a way that SUPPORTS Moon’s emotional needs”
                                                                                                                                                      * Consciously sends grounded, nurturing vitality
                                                                                                                                                      * Moon receives stable, supportive energy
                                                                                                                                                      * Result: True harmony and mutual support
Key Insight:
Trines are NOT automatically beneficial—they’re POWERFUL CHANNELS that transmit whatever Planet One sends. If what’s being sent is good, it’s received fully (positive). If what’s being sent is misaligned, it’s ALSO received fully (problematic).

6.6 Quincunx (150°): The Delegation
Direct Quote:
“Quincunx, one of my favorite aspects, just because… nobody wanted to figure this one out. And all they really know about is these two don’t really go together and there’s some sort of balancing. You’re not supposed to balance. That’s actually the key is you don’t try to balance these energies.”
Geometric Definition:
                                                                                                                                                      * 150° separation between two planets
                                                                                                                                                      * Five signs away from each other
                                                                                                                                                      * Also called “inconjunct”
PERCEPTION:
Direct Quote:
“So what ends up happening, … sun here at 150 degrees to the moon. The sun and the moon may feel like they’re at an impasse. My energy and your energy, we are just not combining. I don’t have anything for you. You don’t have anything for me.”
How the quincunx feels:
                                                                                                                                                      * Impasse - “We’re stuck, can’t bridge the gap”
                                                                                                                                                      * Incompatibility - “These energies don’t go together”
                                                                                                                                                      * Nothing for each other - “You can’t help me, I can’t help you”
                                                                                                                                                      * Adjustment needed - Traditional interpretation says “adjust to each other”
REALITY:
Direct Quote:
“But the reality is that the moon is a natural receiver for the sun, kind of like a trine. But the two are not meant to merge together. And that is key. So it’s not when people are like, ‘oh, you got to balance it out.’ You got to bring them together. No, that’s the worst thing you can do with the quincunx.”
What the quincunx actually represents:
                                                                                                                                                      * One-way transmission - Like trine, but NOT meant to merge
                                                                                                                                                      * Delegation, not integration - Hand off the task, don’t do it together
                                                                                                                                                      * Compartmentalization - Keep energies SEPARATE but communicate
                                                                                                                                                      * Directional aim - Point energy in right direction, then let go
The Email Metaphor:
Direct Quote:
“The sun just has to aim its influence in the direction of the moon. … it’s just direction. I’m talking to you. I’m not talking, we’re not having a conversation. I’m just talking to you. You’re going to take the information and go away. But what if it’s you I’m supposed to talk to? Well, I just direct it to you so that I’m talking to the right person…”
Quincunx is like sending an email:
                                                                                                                                                      * You write the message (Planet One)
                                                                                                                                                      * You send it to the right recipient (Planet Two)
                                                                                                                                                      * You DON’T need a conversation
                                                                                                                                                      * You DON’T need to merge with recipient
                                                                                                                                                      * Recipient takes the info and handles it independently
What NOT To Do:
Direct Quote:
“So it’s not when people are like, ‘oh, you got to balance it out.’ You got to bring them together. No, that’s the worst thing you can do with the quincunx.”
Wrong Approach:
                                                                                                                                                      * “Try to integrate these energies”
                                                                                                                                                      * “Balance them out”
                                                                                                                                                      * “Make them work together”
                                                                                                                                                      * “Adjust until they harmonize”
Right Approach:
                                                                                                                                                      * AIM the energy correctly
                                                                                                                                                      * Delegate the task
                                                                                                                                                      * Let them remain separate
                                                                                                                                                      * One-way communication
The Unidirectional Flow:
Direct Quote:
“It only goes in one direction, though. So it doesn’t go from moon back. It only reacts from moon back. So if the sun is there and it’s not delivering properly to the moon, the moon gets unsettled. And that’s where that reactive energy happens.”
Planet One (Sun):
                                                                                                                                                      * Sends energy/information TO Planet Two
                                                                                                                                                      * Must aim correctly
                                                                                                                                                      * Cannot force integration
Planet Two (Moon):
                                                                                                                                                      * Receives what Planet One sends
                                                                                                                                                      * Takes it and “goes away” (handles it independently)
                                                                                                                                                      * Cannot send back—can only REACT if it’s wrong
If Sun sends to wrong “person” (wrong direction):
                                                                                                                                                      * Moon gets unsettled (reactive energy)
                                                                                                                                                      * Signal that aim was off
Resolution Strategy:
                                                                                                                                                      1. Don’t try to merge them - Worst mistake with quincunx
                                                                                                                                                      2. Identify what needs delegating - What should Planet One hand off to Planet Two?
                                                                                                                                                      3. Aim correctly - Direct the energy/task to the right place
                                                                                                                                                      4. Let go - Don’t micromanage how Planet Two handles it
                                                                                                                                                      5. Separate domains - Accept that these energies operate independently
Example: Sun Quincunx Pluto
Sun at 15° Taurus, Pluto at 15° Libra:
Perception:
                                                                                                                                                      * “My ego/will (Sun) and transformation/power (Pluto) don’t work together”
                                                                                                                                                      * “I need to adjust one to fit the other”
                                                                                                                                                      * Feels like constant tension
Reality:
                                                                                                                                                      * Sun must DELEGATE transformation work to Pluto
                                                                                                                                                      * Sun says: “Here’s what needs to be transformed” (sends the info)
                                                                                                                                                      * Pluto receives it and does the deep work INDEPENDENTLY
                                                                                                                                                      * Sun doesn’t participate in the transformation process
Integration:
                                                                                                                                                      * Sun identifies: “This aspect of my life needs profound change”
                                                                                                                                                      * Sun aims that awareness toward Pluto
                                                                                                                                                      * Pluto receives it and does the shadow work/transformation
                                                                                                                                                      * Sun doesn’t try to CONTROL the transformation (that’s Pluto’s job)
                                                                                                                                                      * Result: Sun continues shining while Pluto handles the depth work separately
Key Insight:
Quincunx is about outsourcing, not integrating. Some energies work best when they operate in SEPARATE domains with one-way communication, not forced collaboration.

6.7 Opposition (180°): The Balance Point
Direct Quote:
“Opposition. Now, this is not a direct opposition. This is applying towards 180 degrees… The perception is that the sun feels like the moon is the enemy. … The reality is that the moon is finalizing its arc journey through the spectrum. … both need to work concurrently. This is where most people mess up. They think that it’s all about compromise, when in reality it’s about balance and fairness, not compromise.”
Geometric Definition:
                                                                                                                                                      * 180° separation between two planets
                                                                                                                                                      * Directly across from each other on chart wheel
                                                                                                                                                      * Maximum separation possible


PERCEPTION:
Direct Quote:
“The perception is that the sun feels like the moon is the enemy.”
How the opposition feels (applying toward 180°):
                                                                                                                                                      * Enemy dynamic - “You’re against me”
                                                                                                                                                      * Polarization - “We’re on opposite sides”
                                                                                                                                                      * Need to compromise - Traditional advice
                                                                                                                                                      * One must win - Competitive feeling
REALITY:
Direct Quote:
“The reality is that the moon is finalizing its arc journey through the spectrum. … both need to work concurrently. This is where most people mess up. They think that it’s all about compromise, when in reality it’s about balance and fairness, not compromise.”
What the opposition actually represents:
                                                                                                                                                      * Journey completion - Planet Two has traveled full 180°
                                                                                                                                                      * Concurrent action - Both work AT THE SAME TIME
                                                                                                                                                      * Balance, not compromise - Don’t give up parts of each; honor both fully
                                                                                                                                                      * Fairness - Each gets their full expression
                                                                                                                                                      * Handoff point - Roles about to reverse
Compromise vs Balance:
COMPROMISE (Wrong):
                                                                                                                                                      * “Sun gives up some vitality, Moon gives up some emotion”
                                                                                                                                                      * “Meet in the middle”
                                                                                                                                                      * “Neither gets full expression”
                                                                                                                                                      * Both diminished
BALANCE (Correct):
                                                                                                                                                      * “Sun expresses FULL vitality, Moon expresses FULL emotion”
                                                                                                                                                      * “Both do their thing simultaneously”
                                                                                                                                                      * “Each focuses on their domain within the same situation”
                                                                                                                                                      * Both enhanced
The Concurrent Action Requirement:
Direct Quote:
“you can do both at the same exact time within the same exact thing, but the moon’s focusing on this part of it, the sun’s focusing on this part of it.”
Example Given:
Sun in work context, Moon in relationship context:
                                                                                                                                                      * Sun focuses on PURPOSE/CAREER aspects
                                                                                                                                                      * Moon focuses on EMOTIONAL/SECURITY aspects
                                                                                                                                                      * Both operate in the SAME LIFE, SAME MOMENTS
                                                                                                                                                      * Don’t take turns—work CONCURRENTLY
At Exact Opposition (180.000°):
Direct Quote:
“then finally, in the aspect spectrum, we reach the opposition point of exactitude at 180 degrees. … This is the second handoff point switching leadership. So what’s going to happen is that planet one has been the sun. Planet two has been the moon. You’re going to see it flip in just a moment. because this is a handoff point.”
At exactitude:
                                                                                                                                                      * Both equally supported (like conjunction)
                                                                                                                                                      * Neither leads, both essential
                                                                                                                                                      * Perfect awareness of each other
                                                                                                                                                      * Maximum illumination (like Full Moon)
The Handoff:
As Moon continues past 180.000°:
                                                                                                                                                      * Moon becomes Planet One (new sender/leader)
                                                                                                                                                      * Sun becomes Planet Two (new receiver/solution)
                                                                                                                                                      * Return journey begins (180° → 360°/0°)
The Halfway Point:
Direct Quote:
“The aspect spectrum comprises seven major aspects across 12 aspect points, which are the 12 signs, the 12 houses, or, geometrically speaking, the 12 30-degree points. The conjunction begins the journey. The opposition ends it. But in traveling the zodiacal wheel, this leaves us at a midpoint. We’re not done our journey. We’re halfway. Much like a solar lunar opposition of the full moon, we’re only halfway. What are you doing? We got to come all the way back.”
Opposition is NOT the end:
                                                                                                                                                      * It’s the TURNING POINT
                                                                                                                                                      * Like Full Moon = midpoint of lunar cycle
                                                                                                                                                      * Must return to conjunction to complete cycle
                                                                                                                                                      * The awareness gained at opposition fuels the return journey
Resolution Strategy:
                                                                                                                                                      1. Don’t see as enemies - Not opposing forces, complementary ones
                                                                                                                                                      2. Don’t compromise - Don’t diminish either planet
                                                                                                                                                      3. Establish balance - Both get full expression
                                                                                                                                                      4. Work concurrently - Not taking turns, simultaneous action
                                                                                                                                                      5. Prepare for role reversal - After opposition, favor shifts
Example: Mercury Opposition Jupiter
Mercury at 15° Gemini, Jupiter at 15° Sagittarius:
Perception:

                                                                                                                                                      * “Must choose: focus on details OR see big picture”
Reality:

                                                                                                                                                      * Mercury focuses on gathering information, analyzing details
                                                                                                                                                      * Jupiter focuses on understanding meaning, seeing patterns
                                                                                                                                                      * SAME SITUATION, different focuses working together
Integration:
                                                                                                                                                      * Writing a research paper:

7. FORCED VS TRUE ASPECTS: ORB MECHANICS
7.1 True Aspects Defined
Direct Quote:
“We’re only using true aspects right now, which means the sun has a 10-degree orb of influence. The moon has a three-degree orb of influence. So we’re assuming zero to three orbs, three degrees orb right now.”
True Aspect Definition:
A true aspect occurs when both planets involved are within their respective orbs of influence for that aspect.
Orb of Influence:
Each planet has a specific “reach” or sphere of influence:








Planet
	Orb of Influence
	Sun
	10°
	Moon
	3°
	Mercury
	7°
	Venus
	7°
	Mars
	7°
	Jupiter
	9°
	Saturn
	9°
	Uranus
	5°
	Neptune
	5°
	Pluto
	5°


	True Aspect Requirement:
Both planets must be within their orbs for the aspect to be “true.”
Example 1: Sun-Moon Conjunction (True)
                                                                                                                                                      * Sun at 10° Aries

7.2 Forced Aspects Defined
Direct Quote:
“Beyond three-degree orbs, it’s a forced aspect. It’s a whole different thing, whole other webinar. But you’ll read about that in the book. … When it’s a forced aspect, you start realizing when you break it down, like, ‘Oh my God!’ It feeds it in, but the second planet didn’t want it or the first planet didn’t want to. Like, the second planet’s reaching back, ‘Hey, give that to me.’ That’s a forced aspect.”
Forced Aspect Definition:
A forced aspect occurs when the geometric relationship exists (e.g., 90° for square), but one or both planets are OUTSIDE their orbs of influence.
How Forced Aspects Happen:
Scenario 1: One Planet Outside Orb
                                                                                                                                                      * Sun at 10° Aries (square to) Saturn at 10° Cancer

7.3 Minor Aspect Orbs
Direct Quote:
“as it becomes more minor, the orb of influence shrinks. So that 72, you get to a degree and a half, and it takes you to the 75 degree aspect. There is a 75. So if you take 72, a degree and a half, which is minor aspects. That’s the door of influence. You take the 75, a degree and a half, and that meets right there. So you literally go from one aspect to the next one.”
Minor Aspects:
Beyond the seven major aspects, there are minor aspects at smaller degree increments:

Orb for Minor Aspects:
Direct Quote:
“as it becomes more minor, the orb of influence shrinks. So that 72, you get to a degree and a half”
Minor aspects have much smaller orbs:
                                                                                                                                                      * Major aspects: Use planet’s full orb (3°-10°)
                                                                                                                                                      * Minor aspects: ~1.5° maximum
Why Smaller Orbs:
Direct Quote:
“So if you take 72, a degree and a half, which is minor aspects. That’s the door of influence. You take the 75, a degree and a half, and that meets right there. So you literally go from one aspect to the next one.”
Minor aspects are transitional stages between major aspects:
                                                                                                                                                      * They connect the major aspects
                                                                                                                                                      * If their orbs were large, they’d overlap with major aspects
                                                                                                                                                      * Smaller orbs keep them distinct
                                                                                                                                                      * You “go from one aspect to the next” through the minor aspects
The 72° Example:
Quintile (72°):
                                                                                                                                                      * Orb: ~1.5°
                                                                                                                                                      * Range: 70.5° to 73.5°
Next Minor Aspect (75°):
                                                                                                                                                      * Orb: ~1.5°
                                                                                                                                                      * Range: 73.5° to 76.5°
They meet at 73.5°, creating continuous coverage without overlap.

7.4 Rolling Aspects
Direct Quote:
“Because when you read your chart, it’s like, ‘Oh, I have a conjunction. That’s not enough. There’s way more going on in your chart than just a conjunction.’ Which planets first? Is it applying? Is it separating? What planets are involved? All of that’s important. Is it a true aspect? Is it a forced aspect? Is it a rolling aspect? All these are different ways that this plays out.”
Rolling Aspect Mentioned:
The instructor references “rolling aspects” as a third category beyond true and forced, but doesn’t elaborate in this webinar.
Likely Definition (Synthesized from Context):
A rolling aspect probably refers to:
                                                                                                                                                      * Aspects that are applying (coming into exactitude)
                                                                                                                                                      * OR aspects that are separating (moving away from exactitude)
                                                                                                                                                      * The aspect is “rolling” toward or away from perfect degree alignment
Why It Matters:
Applying Aspect:
                                                                                                                                                      * Energy building toward exactitude
                                                                                                                                                      * Increasing intensity
                                                                                                                                                      * Future-oriented
Exact Aspect:
                                                                                                                                                      * Maximum intensity
                                                                                                                                                      * Perfect alignment
                                                                                                                                                      * Present moment
Separating Aspect:
                                                                                                                                                      * Energy releasing from exactitude

                                                                                                                                                      * Integrating the experience
The Movement Context:
Direct Quote:
“Which planets first? Is it applying? Is it separating?”
The direction of motion affects how the aspect is experienced:
                                                                                                                                                      * Same square, different experience if applying vs separating
                                                                                                                                                      * Applying square = building friction (problem emerging)
                                                                                                                                                      * Separating square = releasing friction (problem being integrated)

7.5 Practical Orb Checking
Chart Reading Protocol:
When analyzing an aspect in a chart:
Step 1: Calculate Exact Degree Separation
                                                                                                                                                      * Planet A at 10° Aries = 10°
                                                                                                                                                      * Planet B at 15° Cancer = 105°
                                                                                                                                                      * Separation: 105° - 10° = 95°
Step 2: Identify Nearest Major Aspect
                                                                                                                                                      * 95° is closest to 90° (square)
                                                                                                                                                      * 95° - 90° = 5° past exact square
Step 3: Check Both Planets’ Orbs
                                                                                                                                                      * Planet A orb: [lookup table]
                                                                                                                                                      * Planet B orb: [lookup table]
                                                                                                                                                      * Is 5° within both orbs?
Step 4: Determine Aspect Type
                                                                                                                                                      * If within both orbs: TRUE ASPECT
                                                                                                                                                      * If outside one/both orbs: FORCED ASPECT
                                                                                                                                                      * If no major aspect within range: Not aspecting (though minor aspects might apply)
Example Calculation:
Sun at 12° Leo, Mars at 20° Scorpio:
                                                                                                                                                      * Sun: 12° + 120° (Leo starts at 120°) = 132°
                                                                                                                                                      * Mars: 20° + 210° (Scorpio starts at 210°) = 230°
                                                                                                                                                      * Separation: 230° - 132° = 98°
                                                                                                                                                      * Nearest aspect: 90° (square)
                                                                                                                                                      * Distance from exact: 98° - 90° = 8°
Orb Check:
                                                                                                                                                      * Sun orb: 10° ✓ (8° is within 10°)
                                                                                                                                                      * Mars orb: 7° ✗ (8° exceeds 7°)
                                                                                                                                                      * Result: FORCED SQUARE (Sun wants to engage, Mars is outside orb)

8. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: REAL CHART CASE STUDIES
8.1 Instructor’s Sun Opposite Neptune
Direct Quote:
“in my chart, there’s an opposition. I’m not going to worry about which planets first and second. We can talk about that elsewhere. But I have my sun opposite Neptune retrograde. My Sun inherently has Aries traits because it’s my Ascendant ruler as a Leo rising. My Neptune retrograde has Scorpio traits because it’s my 8th house ruler. And it’s in the 5th house. So we have the 11th, 5th house. So we have Aquarius energy and Leo energy there. And then I’m not going to go any further. But the sun is in opposition to Neptune.”
Chart Details:
Sun:
                                                                                                                                                      * Leo rising (Sun rules Ascendant)
                                                                                                                                                      * Inherent Aries traits (through rulership)
                                                                                                                                                      * 11th house position (Aquarius themes)
Neptune Retrograde:
                                                                                                                                                      * 5th house position (Leo themes)
                                                                                                                                                      * 8th house ruler (Scorpio themes)
                                                                                                                                                      * Retrograde (internalized/review energy)
Opposition Dynamics:
Direct Quote:
“And anything that has to do with like trauma and pain and sensitivity and, you know, even illusion over. the sun which is ego action things i’m doing uh you know purpose father there’s that that pulling away from it saying that neptune is not working with the sun.”
PERCEPTION:
                                                                                                                                                      * Neptune (trauma, pain, sensitivity, illusion) feels like it’s AGAINST Sun (ego, action, purpose, father)
                                                                                                                                                      * Pulling away from each other
                                                                                                                                                      * Neptune “not working with” Sun
                                                                                                                                                      * Experience of Neptune undermining ego/identity
Comparative Example:
Direct Quote:
“like my wife right so she has her sun um she has her sun in pisces My daughter, Isla, has her sun conjunct Neptune, also Venus, but in this case, in this example, sun conjunct Neptune in Pisces. So they have Pisces working together with the sun. I have an opposition to it.”
Wife & Daughter: Sun Conjunct Neptune (Pisces)
                                                                                                                                                      * Sun and Neptune MERGED
                                                                                                                                                      * Pisces themes integrated WITH ego/identity
                                                                                                                                                      * Natural spiritual/artistic identity

Application:
Direct Quote:
“So the same themes show up, but instead of working together within Pisces energy. or in my case within, you know, Aquarian slash Gemini energy, it’s working what feels like against it. It is up to me to pull it together.”
Resolution:

                                                                                                                                                      * Must work CONCURRENTLY (opposition requirement)
                                                                                                                                                      * Sun focuses on ego/identity/purpose (11th house)
                                                                                                                                                      * Neptune focuses on spirituality/sensitivity/dissolution (5th house)

                                                                                                                                                      * This is the opposition working—both operating, creating unique expression

                                                                                                                                                      * Additional: Moon opposition Chiron
Sextile Dynamics:
Direct Quote:
“So the way that this plays out, Chiron influences it the way it plays out a little bit for her. Obviously. But everything that I do—and everything the mother does— always works together. But whatever I do always has to do with what the mother sets in motion.”
SEXTILE = Partnership/Cooperation:
                                                                                                                                                      * Moon (mother/emotional foundation) in cooperative relationship with 1st house identity
                                                                                                                                                      * Father (instructor) and mother always work together

                                                                                                                                                      * Classic sextile: Must consciously INCLUDE the partnership
Birth Story Application:
Direct Quote:
“So when she was born, she was separated from her mother. Chiron trines in to the moon. Chiron is in opposition to the sun. She was separated from her mother. I physically took her to her mother in the hospital. That is all within her chart as well.”
Chart Manifestation:

                                                                                                                                                      * Moon-Sun sextile: Father’s role in bridging that separation
                                                                                                                                                      * Real-life event: Father (Sun) physically reconnected daughter (Moon) with mother

8.3 Instructor’s North Node Semi-Sextile Ascendant
Direct Quote:
“Now, it’s a little bit different because the Ascendant is the faster-moving planet, so it’s a separating aspect as opposed to an applying aspect. That does matter, obviously, but in terms of Planet 1 and Planet 2, they still work like that. The stuff from the 12th house, like all of it, expressing through cancer, that North Node trajectory, it’s always been in conflict with me.”

North Node:

Ascendant:

Aspect: Semi-Sextile (30°) - Separating
PERCEPTION:
Direct Quote:
“The stuff from the 12th house, like all of it, expressing through cancer, that North Node trajectory, it’s always been in conflict with me. How I want to do things, how I emerge, who I think I am and the actions that I try to take. I’ve always kind of shunned it. And I do that because I don’t understand it.”

These felt incompatible—blind spot.
REALITY & RESOLUTION:
Direct Quote:
“So I had to. Once I start kind of bringing it in, like even bringing the spirituality and connecting to people on a much more personal level to bring that into like the astrology, that’s where this system actually formed. you know, was created and actually meant something. Once it was just the science towards the beginning, it was like, cool, that’s really awesome. But until I said, I have to figure out how to apply this on a spiritual level, on a personal level for each individual person. is when the whole thing was brought to life. And that is literally Cancer to Leo-type energy, Pisces to Aries-type energy, that semi-sextile between my North Node and Ascendant.”
Integration of Semi-Sextile:
                                                                                                                                                      1. Recognized the blind spot - North Node was there but not understood
                                                                                                                                                      2. Consciously brought it in - “bringing the spirituality and connecting to people on a much more personal level”
                                                                                                                                                      3. Applied it to Ascendant expression - Integrated 12th house themes into Leo identity
                                                                                                                                                      4. Result: Created the entire Alchemistic Astrology system
The System’s Birth:
Phase 1: Just Science (Leo Ascendant alone)
                                                                                                                                                      * Focused on astronomy, mathematics, geometry
                                                                                                                                                      * “Cool, that’s really awesome” but lacked depth
Phase 2: Adding Spirituality/Personal Connection (12th House North Node integrated)
                                                                                                                                                      * Applied astrology on spiritual level
                                                                                                                                                      * Connected to people personally (Cancer)
                                                                                                                                                      * “when the whole thing was brought to life”
This semi-sextile integration:
                                                                                                                                                      * Cancer (emotional/spiritual/hidden) → Leo (expressive/confident/visible)
                                                                                                                                                      * Created the unique approach: Scientific precision (Leo) infused with spiritual depth (Cancer)
                                                                                                                                                      * The “hard stop” forced the instructor to pause and integrate what was in the blind spot

The Transmutation Process:
Step 1: Identify the Perception
                                                                                                                                                      * “How does this aspect naturally play out?”
                                                                                                                                                      * “Where’s the friction/problem?”
                                                                                                                                                      * “Which planet feels ‘in the right’?”
Step 2: Understand the Reality
                                                                                                                                                      * “What does the geometric relationship actually require?”
                                                                                                                                                      * “What’s the solution hidden in Planet Two?”
                                                                                                                                                      * “How must Planet One adjust?”
Step 3: Reorient the Energy
Direct Quote:
“Being able to reorient the trajectory of each energy lets all of the pieces connect in their natural relationship with the least amount of friction.”
                                                                                                                                                      * Adjust Planet One’s trajectory toward Planet Two
                                                                                                                                                      * Align with the solution
                                                                                                                                                      * Allow natural flow with minimal resistance
Step 4: Experience the Transformation
                                                                                                                                                      * Friction transmutes into constructive tension
                                                                                                                                                      * Problems become growth opportunities
                                                                                                                                                      * Aspects serve conscious evolution

9.2 Connection to Bidirectional Energy (Transcript 8)
From Transcript 8 (Uber Newbie Basics):
Bidirectional energy concept: Planets and signs have two-way relationships through rulership.
Aspect Spectrum Application:
Planet One ← → Planet Two
This IS a bidirectional relationship:
Direction 1: Planet One → Planet Two
                                                                                                                                                      * Energy flows FROM Planet One (sender)
                                                                                                                                                      * TO Planet Two (receiver)
                                                                                                                                                      * Primary direction (0° → 180°)
Direction 2: Planet Two ← Planet One
                                                                                                                                                      * Planet Two REACTS back
                                                                                                                                                      * Cannot initiate but responds
                                                                                                                                                      * Secondary feedback loop
AND at Opposition:
Direction switches entirely:
                                                                                                                                                      * Planet Two becomes Planet One (new sender)
                                                                                                                                                      * Planet One becomes Planet Two (new receiver)
                                                                                                                                                      * Return journey (180° → 360°/0°)
Connection to Rulership:
Just as a planet has bidirectional energy with its ruled sign:
                                                                                                                                                      * Sun rules Leo

                                                                                                                                                      * Energy flows FROM Leo’s house back to Sun (Base concept - Transcript 15)
In aspects:

                                                                                                                                                      * “I must adjust my purpose to INCLUDE Moon’s safety requirements”
Reverse Vantage (Moon’s perspective):
                                                                                                                                                      * “My emotional security (Moon) is being BUILT FROM how Sun expresses vitality”
                                                                                                                                                      * “If Sun ignores my needs, my foundation becomes unstable”
Return Square (Moon = Planet One, Sun = Planet Two - after opposition):
Forward Vantage (Moon’s perspective):
                                                                                                                                                      * “My emotional needs (Moon) feel friction with purpose (Sun)”
                                                                                                                                                      * “I must adjust my feelings to HONOR Sun’s vitality”
Reverse Vantage (Sun’s perspective):
                                                                                                                                                      * “My vitality (Sun) is being BUILT FROM how Moon maintains emotional security”
                                                                                                                                                      * “If Moon is unstable, my purpose has no foundation”
All four are valid and reveal different layers of the same square.

Aries to Gemini (60° - Sextile):
                                                                                                                                                      * Aries (action) can cooperate with Gemini (communication)
                                                                                                                                                      * Partnership: Acting + Thinking work together

Aries to Cancer (90° - Square):
                                                                                                                                                      * Aries (action) forced to integrate Cancer (emotion/safety)
                                                                                                                                                      * Friction: Impulsive action vs emotional security
                                                                                                                                                      * This PROVES Cancer forces Aries to consider feelings/home
And so on through the zodiac…
The Spectrum PROVES FREE:
Each sign’s position relative to every other sign creates specific aspectual relationships that DEFINE what that sign must mean.
If Aries is pure action at 0°, then:

                                                                                                                                                      * Gemini at 60° MUST be about thinking about that action
                                                                                                                                                      * Cancer at 90° MUST be about feeling secure while acting
                                                                                                                                                      * Leo at 120° MUST be about expressing that action vitally

9.7 Aspect Resolution
Direct Quote:
“This is why aspect resolution came about. Was I looking at it backwards, and it worked? … So again, this perception, understanding this is the problem. It will aid you in identifying what needs to be adjusted towards opportunity.”
Aspect Resolution Defined:
The system for transforming problematic aspect expression (perception) into functional aspect integration (reality).
The Three-Step Process:
Step 1: Identify the Perception

                                                                                                                                                      * What friction/problem occurs automatically?
                                                                                                                                                      * Which planet thinks it’s right?
Step 2: Understand the Reality
                                                                                                                                                      * What does the aspect geometrically require?
                                                                                                                                                      * Which planet is actually the problem (Planet One)?
                                                                                                                                                      * Which planet holds the solution (Planet Two)?
Step 3: Reorient for Resolution
                                                                                                                                                      * Adjust Planet One’s trajectory TOWARD Planet Two
                                                                                                                                                      * Align with the solution
                                                                                                                                                      * Allow natural flow
The “Backwards” Discovery:
Direct Quote:
“And the reason why aspect spectrum came about is because I realized, and here’s a fun fact for you that I put in my book. is that the orbit of the Earth, if you were to remove the sidereal rotation, meaning just do orbit, do not do spin, the Earth going around the Sun, the Sun would rise in the west and set in the east.”
Astronomical Basis:
If Earth orbited without rotating:
                                                                                                                                                      * Sun would appear to rise in WEST (not East)
                                                                                                                                                      * This is the “natural” direction of orbital motion
                                                                                                                                                      * Earth’s rotation creates the PERCEPTION of Sun rising in East
Aspect Interpretation Parallel:
Traditional astrology reads aspects in the “perceived” direction (like sunrise in East).
Aspect Spectrum reads aspects in the “real” direction (like orbit without rotation).
Looking Backwards Works:
Direct Quote:
“when I started creating energy flow, I started realizing: ‘What if I’m supposed to illuminate, because of the sun, bring vitality to the relationships of these planets? The aspects, backwards.’ And this is why I had to create the aspect spectrum, because what I realized is that through the major energies, It’s more like a trek that these energies go out on, like a journey.”
By reversing the typical interpretation (looking at what Planet ONE must do to align with Planet TWO, rather than assuming Planet ONE is right), resolution becomes possible.
Practical Application:
Traditional Approach (Doesn’t Resolve):
                                                                                                                                                      * Mars square Saturn: “Mars is frustrated by Saturn”
                                                                                                                                                      * Focus on Mars’s frustration
                                                                                                                                                      * Try to “overcome” Saturn
                                                                                                                                                      * Result: Continued friction
Aspect Resolution Approach (Resolves):
                                                                                                                                                      * Mars square Saturn: “Mars (Planet One) must align with Saturn (Planet Two)”
                                                                                                                                                      * Focus on Mars adjusting to INCLUDE Saturn
                                                                                                                                                      * Work WITH Saturn’s structure
                                                                                                                                                      * Result: Disciplined action, problem solved

11. SUMMARY & KEY TAKEAWAYS
11.1 The Seven Major Aspects
Alchemistic Astrology recognizes seven major aspects (not five) because every 30° division of the 360° wheel is significant:
                                                                                                                                                      1. Conjunction (0°) - Merger, beginning, handoff point
                                                                                                                                                      2. Semi-Sextile (30°) - Blind spot, hard stop, first separation
                                                                                                                                                      3. Sextile (60°) - Partnership, cooperation, conscious inclusion required
                                                                                                                                                      4. Square (90°) - Forced integration, equal support, turnover point
                                                                                                                                                      5. Trine (120°) - Unimpeded flow, requires intentional direction
                                                                                                                                                      6. Quincunx (150°) - Delegation, one-way communication, compartmentalization
                                                                                                                                                      7. Opposition (180°) - Balance (not compromise), handoff point, role reversal

11.2 The Aspect Spectrum Journey
Aspects are not isolated—they’re stages in a continuous journey:
Outward Journey (0° → 180°):
                                                                                                                                                      * Faster planet pulls ahead of slower planet

                                                                                                                                                      * Faster planet = Planet Two (receiver, solution)
                                                                                                                                                      * Journey culminates at opposition
Opposition Handoff (180°):
                                                                                                                                                      * Both planets equally supported
                                                                                                                                                      * Roles FLIP
                                                                                                                                                      * Faster planet becomes Planet One
                                                                                                                                                      * Slower planet becomes Planet Two
Return Journey (180° → 360°/0°):
                                                                                                                                                      * Same seven aspects in reverse order
                                                                                                                                                      * NEW Planet One/Two roles
                                                                                                                                                      * Journey completes at next conjunction
This creates a complete developmental cycle, not a linear progression.

PLANET TWO (The Solution):

Key Insight: Planet One must ALIGN WITH Planet Two, not overcome it.

11.4 The 180° Rule
Two Handoff Points:
1. Conjunction (0°):
                                                                                                                                                      * Journey begins
                                                                                                                                                      * Both planets merge
                                                                                                                                                      * Faster planet pulls ahead, establishing roles
2. Opposition (180°):
                                                                                                                                                      * Journey reaches midpoint/climax
                                                                                                                                                      * Both planets equally supported
                                                                                                                                                      * Roles FLIP for return journey
Critical Understanding:
Same aspect (e.g., square) plays out DIFFERENTLY depending on which side of opposition you’re on:
                                                                                                                                                      * Before opposition: Slower planet sends to faster planet
                                                                                                                                                      * After opposition: Faster planet sends to slower planet
Planetary vantage matters—always check which journey phase (outward vs return).

11.5 Perception vs Reality Framework
Every aspect has two layers:
PERCEPTION (How it naturally feels):
                                                                                                                                                      * Automatic, unconscious response
                                                                                                                                                      * Usually creates problems/friction
                                                                                                                                                      * Planet One thinks it’s right
                                                                                                                                                      * Planet Two seems like obstacle
REALITY (How to resolve it):
                                                                                                                                                      * Conscious, intentional alignment
                                                                                                                                                      * Creates solutions/integration
                                                                                                                                                      * Planet One must adjust
                                                                                                                                                      * Planet Two holds the key
Alchemy:
                                                                                                                                                      * Transform lead (perception) into gold (reality)
                                                                                                                                                      * Reorient Planet One toward Planet Two
                                                                                                                                                      * Allow natural flow with minimal friction

11.6 True vs Forced Aspects
TRUE ASPECT:
                                                                                                                                                      * Both planets within their orbs of influence
                                                                                                                                                      * Flows naturally
                                                                                                                                                      * Feels normal, coordinated
                                                                                                                                                      * Functions as designed
FORCED ASPECT:
                                                                                                                                                      * One or both planets outside orbs
                                                                                                                                                      * Feels strained, uncoordinated

Always check orb validity—same aspect type can be true or forced depending on exact degrees.

11.7 Support and Favor
Support = Which planet gets focus:
General Pattern:
                                                                                                                                                      * Applying toward major aspect: Planet One supported
                                                                                                                                                      * At exactitude (0°, 90°, 180°): Both equally supported
                                                                                                                                                      * Separating beyond major aspect: Favor shifts toward Planet Two
Turnover Point (90°):
                                                                                                                                                      * Before 90°: Planet One favored
                                                                                                                                                      * At 90°: Both equal
                                                                                                                                                      * After 90°: Planet Two favored (even though still technically Planet Two until 180°)
This creates dynamic interpretation—same aspect, different focus depending on exact degree.

11.9 Common Mistakes Corrected
MISTAKE #1: “Conjunctions are always good, squares are always bad”
                                                                                                                                                      * CORRECTION: All aspects have perception (often problematic) and reality (resolution path). Even “harmonious” trines can be disruptive if misaligned.
MISTAKE #2: “Oppositions mean you must compromise”
                                                                                                                                                      * CORRECTION: Oppositions require BALANCE and CONCURRENT ACTION, not compromise. Both planets get full expression simultaneously.
MISTAKE #3: “Ignoring semi-sextile and quincunx as ‘minor’”
                                                                                                                                                      * CORRECTION: Every 30° division is a MAJOR aspect. Semi-sextile and quincunx are essential stages in the journey.
MISTAKE #4: “Reading aspects without checking Planet One/Two roles”
                                                                                                                                                      * CORRECTION: Always determine which planet is sender vs receiver and whether you’re on outward or return journey.
MISTAKE #5: “Assuming aspects are isolated events”
                                                                                                                                                      * CORRECTION: Aspects are stages in a continuous spectrum from conjunction through opposition and back.
MISTAKE #6: “Not checking orb validity”
                                                                                                                                                      * CORRECTION: True aspects feel different from forced aspects—always verify both planets are within orbs.
MISTAKE #7: “Trying to ‘balance’ quincunx energies”
                                                                                                                                                      * CORRECTION: Quincunx requires DELEGATION and COMPARTMENTALIZATION, not integration or balance.

                                                                                                                                                      * Which is Planet One (sender)? Which is Planet Two (receiver)?
Step 4: Identify Support

Direct Quote:
“If you ever feel unsure, please revert back to this framework.”
The PDF is the master reference—when confused about aspect interpretation, return to the framework.

📘 TRANSCRIPT 13: DELEGATES & HOUSE CONDITIONS
Complete Knowledge Extraction for App Development
________________


OVERVIEW
This transcript introduces two of the most critical concepts in Alchemistic Astrology: Delegates and House Conditions. These concepts fundamentally distinguish this system from traditional astrology and are essential for accurate chart interpretation.
Delegates are planetary rulers that act as representatives or ambassadors for entire houses, carrying all house themes to wherever they’re positioned in the chart. House Conditions represent the sum total of all energies within a house—every planet, aspect, retrograde status, and their interactions—creating the complete energetic environment of that life area.
Understanding these concepts transforms chart reading from surface-level keyword association into sophisticated, multi-layered interpretation that reveals the true mechanisms of how life themes manifest.
Key Learning Objectives:
                                                                                                                                                      * Master the technical process of identifying delegates for all 12 houses
                                                                                                                                                      * Understand how delegates relocate house themes throughout the chart
                                                                                                                                                      * Learn to assess complete house conditions (not just individual planets)
                                                                                                                                                      * Recognize how empty houses still function through their delegates
                                                                                                                                                      * Apply delegate networks to transit interpretation
                                                                                                                                                      * Distinguish Alchemistic approaches from traditional dispositorship
________________


SECTION 1: CORE DEFINITIONS & FOUNDATIONAL CONCEPTS
What Are Delegates?
Direct Quote: “A delegate is the planetary ruler of a house that acts as the representative or ambassador for that entire house’s energy. It’s not just a ‘house ruler’ in the traditional sense—the delegate actively embodies and transmits all the themes of that house wherever it’s located in your chart.”
The instructor opens the class by immediately clarifying what makes delegates different from traditional rulership concepts:
Direct Quote: “When we talk about delegates in Alchemistic Astrology, we’re talking about something more dynamic than traditional dispositorship. Traditional astrology creates these closed loops where you trace rulers back and forth until you get stuck. We don’t do that. We use what I call ‘layering’—we trace each influence step by step, and the delegate carries the ENTIRE house condition with it, not just some abstract rulership concept.”
The Bidirectional Nature of Delegates:
One of the most important characteristics of delegates is that energy flows in BOTH directions:
Direct Quote: “This is critical: delegates don’t just send energy FROM the house they rule TO where they’re located. They also receive energy back. It’s bidirectional. So if Venus is in your 12th house and rules your 1st house, your identity and self-expression (1st house) are being filtered through 12th house themes like spirituality, isolation, the unconscious. BUT ALSO, your 12th house experiences are colored by 1st house themes of identity and personal action.”
This bidirectional flow creates a dynamic exchange rather than a one-way transmission, making delegate analysis much richer than simple rulership.
What Are House Conditions?
Direct Quote: “House conditions are the sum of everything in the house. Not just which planets are there, but what ORDER they’re in by degree, what aspects they make to each other, whether they’re retrograde, whether they’re conjunct—everything. The house condition is the complete energetic environment of that life area.”
The instructor emphasizes that house conditions cannot be reduced to simple keyword meanings:
Direct Quote: “You can’t just say ‘Mars in the 7th means aggressive partners.’ You have to look at what ELSE is in the 7th, what aspects Mars is making, where Mars rules from (its delegate role), what sign it’s in, whether it’s retrograde, and what order it comes in if there are multiple planets. That’s the house condition. That’s what creates the actual lived experience.”
Empty Houses Are Not Inactive:
A common misconception addressed immediately:
Direct Quote: “Empty houses are NOT inactive. This is one of the biggest mistakes people make. An empty house just means you look to the delegate—the ruler of that house—to see where those themes are playing out. If your 7th house is empty, you still have relationships! You just look at where the ruler of your 7th is located, and that shows you how relationships manifest for you.”
Key Differences from Traditional Astrology
The instructor spends considerable time distinguishing the Alchemistic approach from traditional methods:
Direct Quote: “Traditional astrology uses something called dispositorship, where you trace the ruler of a planet to its ruler, and that to its ruler, until you get into these closed loops. Planet A rules Planet B, Planet B rules Planet C, Planet C rules Planet A—and you’re stuck. That doesn’t give you useful information. In Alchemistic Astrology, we use delegates and we LAYER. We don’t create hierarchies. We don’t say one ruler is ‘more important’ than another. We say they all work together, additively.”
The Additive Principle:
Direct Quote: “When you have dual rulers—like Scorpio rising means both Mars AND Pluto rule your 1st house—we don’t pick one as ‘the real ruler’ and dismiss the other. Both are delegates. Both carry 1st house energy. Both matter. We add their influences together. Mars shows one dimension of how your identity operates, Pluto shows another. You need both.”
This additive approach prevents the reductionism common in traditional astrology where complex placements get oversimplified.

SECTION 2: OPENING EXAMPLE - DAUGHTER’S CHART (LIBRA RISING)
The instructor begins with a real chart example to make delegates immediately tangible:
Direct Quote: “Let me show you my daughter’s chart. She’s Libra rising, which means Venus rules her 1st house. Venus is her 1st house delegate. Now, where’s Venus? Venus is in her 12th house. So her 1st house—her identity, her sense of self, her physical body, how she takes action in the world—all of that is being delegated through her 12th house. The 12th house is spirituality, isolation, the unconscious, hidden things, what’s behind the scenes.”
Practical Manifestation:
Direct Quote: “What does this look like in real life? She’s deeply spiritual. She processes her identity through solitude and introspection. She’s not someone who needs to be seen or who expresses herself loudly in public spaces. Her sense of self is very internal, very private. She has a rich inner world. That’s Venus in the 12th acting as the delegate for her 1st house.”
The Second House Example:
Direct Quote: “Now let’s look at her 2nd house—money, values, possessions, what she earns. She has Scorpio on the 2nd house cusp, so the ruler is Pluto. Where’s Pluto? Pluto is in her 4th house. So her 2nd house themes—money, what she values, her earning capacity—are being delegated through the 4th house, which is home, family, mother, domestic life, roots, food.”
Direct Quote: “What does this mean practically? Her relationship with money is tied to her mother, to food, to domestic routines. She values things that relate to home and family. Money issues or money opportunities are likely to come through family or domestic situations. She might work from home or have a home-based business. Her values are deeply connected to her sense of roots and belonging.”
This opening example demonstrates several key principles:
                                                                                                                                                      1. Delegates relocate house themes (1st house identity expressed through 12th house isolation)
                                                                                                                                                      2. Practical manifestation is observable (spiritual, private person)
                                                                                                                                                      3. Multiple houses can be analyzed (both 1st and 2nd house delegates shown)
                                                                                                                                                      4. Real-life confirmation validates the technique (instructor knows daughter personally)
________________


SECTION 3: TECHNICAL PROCESS - IDENTIFYING DELEGATES
Step-by-Step Delegate Identification
The instructor provides a clear, replicable process for finding delegates:
Direct Quote: “Here’s exactly how you find the delegate for any house. Step one: Look at the sign on the house cusp. Step two: Identify the planetary ruler of that sign. Step three: Locate that planet by house and sign in the chart. Step four: That planet becomes the delegate for the original house. Step five: Interpret the themes of the original house through the delegate’s position.”
Example Walkthrough - 3rd House:
Direct Quote: “Let’s say you want to find the delegate for the 3rd house—communication, siblings, short trips, early education, the mind. You look at what sign is on your 3rd house cusp. Let’s say it’s Sagittarius. Sagittarius is ruled by Jupiter. Now you find Jupiter in the chart. Let’s say Jupiter is in the 8th house in Taurus. That means Jupiter in the 8th in Taurus is the delegate for your 3rd house. Your communication style, your relationship with siblings, your mental processes—all of that is being filtered through 8th house themes of depth, transformation, shared resources, intimacy, and through Taurus qualities of stability, sensuality, practicality.”
Natural Rulers vs. Chart-Specific Rulers
An important clarification about dual consideration:
Direct Quote: “You always have to consider BOTH the natural ruler of the house AND the chart-specific ruler based on the cusp sign. The natural ruler gives you the inherent energy of that house—like Mars naturally rules the 1st because Aries is the first sign. But your CHART-SPECIFIC ruler depends on your rising sign. If you’re Cancer rising, the Moon rules your 1st house as the chart-specific delegate. You need both. Mars shows the universal 1st house energy, Moon shows your personal expression of that energy.”
Direct Quote: “These aren’t hierarchical. You don’t say ‘the natural ruler matters more’ or ‘the chart ruler matters more.’ They’re additive. They work together. Both are true simultaneously.”
Dual Rulers and Modern Planets
Direct Quote: “When you have signs with dual rulers—Scorpio, Aquarius, Pisces—both planets are delegates. Scorpio is ruled by both Mars and Pluto. If Scorpio is on your 5th house cusp, both Mars AND Pluto are 5th house delegates. You have to look at where both are located and combine their influences. Mars might show the assertive, competitive dimension of your creativity and self-expression, while Pluto shows the intense, transformative, all-or-nothing dimension.”
The instructor notes that this is non-negotiable in Alchemistic Astrology:
Direct Quote: “Some traditional astrologers say ‘I only use the ancient ruler’ or ‘I only use the modern ruler.’ That’s limiting yourself. Reality is complex. You need both perspectives. Both rulers are valid and both contribute to how that house operates.”
Retrograde Delegates
Direct Quote: “If your delegate is retrograde, that adds another layer. Retrogrades internalize energy, make it more reflective, more processing-oriented. If your 10th house delegate is Mercury retrograde, your career and public reputation involve a lot of internal processing, revision, going back over things, communicating in ways that require clarification or repetition. You might be known for intellectual work, teaching, or areas where you constantly refine your message.”
________________


SECTION 4: HOUSE CONDITIONS IN DETAIL
What Creates a House Condition
Direct Quote: “The house condition is literally everything that’s going on in that house. How many planets are there? What are they? What order are they in by degree? Are they making aspects to each other? Are any retrograde? Are any conjunct the house cusp? All of that together creates the house condition. You can’t look at planets in isolation. You have to see the entire ecosystem of that house.”
Order of Planets is Critical:
Direct Quote: “This is something I cannot stress enough: the ORDER of planets in a house matters tremendously. If you have three planets in your 3rd house—let’s say Mars at 5 degrees, Saturn at 12 degrees, and Jupiter at 24 degrees—they activate in that order. Mars energy comes first in your communication. Then Saturn modifies it. Then Jupiter expands it. It’s always sequential. If you don’t know the order, you don’t have the complete picture.”
Direct Quote: “I’ll use my own chart as an example. I have Mars, Saturn, and Pluto in my 3rd house, in that order. So when I communicate, it comes out fast and direct first—that’s Mars. Then I reconsider and add structure—that’s Saturn. Then it either gets intensely held onto or completely dismissed—that’s Pluto. That’s the exact sequence of how my mental process works. If you reversed the order, you’d get a completely different experience.”
Stelliums vs. Satellitiums vs. Singleton Planets
Direct Quote: “A stellium is three or more planets in one house, and they’re all conjunct within orb. A satellitium is three or more planets in one house, but they’re NOT all conjunct—they’re spread out across the house. The experience is different. A stellium is more unified, more intense, more focused. A satellitium creates a complex, multi-stage expression of that house’s themes.”
Direct Quote: “A singleton planet—one planet alone in a house—is very direct, very focused. There’s no dilution, no complexity. That planet IS the house condition. If you have just Venus in your 5th house and nothing else, your creativity, romance, and self-expression are purely Venusian. That’s it. That’s the whole condition.”
Empty Houses Revisited
The instructor returns to empty houses with more technical detail:
Direct Quote: “An empty house means you have to rely entirely on the delegate. There’s no direct planetary energy IN that house, so the house themes manifest wherever the delegate is located. This is actually really efficient. Instead of having to manage multiple planets in one house, you have one clear delegate that shows you exactly where and how those themes operate.”
Direct Quote: “Let me give you an example. Denzel Washington has been married for over 40 years. Very stable, very committed marriage. His 7th house is empty. Does that mean he doesn’t have relationships? Obviously not. It means his 7th house themes—partnership, marriage, one-on-one relating—are expressed through his 7th house delegate. You have to look at what sign is on his 7th house cusp, find the ruler, and that tells you HOW he experiences partnership. The empty house doesn’t make it absent. It just redirects where you look.”
Aspects Within Houses
Direct Quote: “When planets in the same house make aspects to each other, that’s part of the house condition. If you have Sun and Moon in the 10th house and they’re square each other, your career and public image involve internal tension between your conscious will and your emotional needs. That square is PART of the 10th house condition. You can’t separate it out and analyze it somewhere else.”
Direct Quote: “This is different from aspects between planets in different houses. Those connect house themes across the chart. But aspects within the same house intensify or complicate that single house’s condition.”
________________


SECTION 5: INSTRUCTOR’S CHART EXAMPLE (LEO RISING)
The instructor uses their own chart for an extended case study:
Direct Quote: “I’m Leo rising, so the Sun rules my 1st house and is my 1st house delegate. My Sun is in the 10th house. That means my identity, my sense of self, my life force—all of that is delegated through my 10th house, which is career, public reputation, what I’m known for. I AM my work. My identity is inseparable from my public role. That’s Sun in the 10th as the 1st house delegate.”

Direct Quote: “My 2nd house has Virgo on the cusp, so Mercury rules my 2nd house. Mercury is my 2nd house delegate. Where’s Mercury? Mercury is in my 11th house, and it’s retrograde. So my money, my values, my earning capacity—all of that is delegated through my 11th house, which is groups, communities, networks, causes, aspirations.”
Direct Quote: “What does this look like? I make money through group work, through teaching, through networks. I don’t have a single employer or a single income stream. My money comes from multiple sources, it fluctuates, it’s tied to how well I connect with communities. The retrograde Mercury means I’m constantly refining my message, going back over material, rethinking how I communicate value. I do a lot of revision. That’s the retrograde quality.”
Third House Analysis
Direct Quote: “My 3rd house is Libra, so Venus rules my 3rd house. Venus is my 3rd house delegate. Where’s Venus? Venus is in my 10th house. So my communication, my siblings, my mental processes—all of that is delegated through my 10th house. My communication serves my career. My reputation IS my communication. I’m known for how I teach and speak. Venus in the 10th as the 3rd house delegate means my communication style is harmonious, diplomatic, aesthetic, and it’s always in service to my public role.”
Direct Quote: “But remember, I also have Mars, Saturn, and Pluto IN my 3rd house. That’s the house condition. So even though Venus is the delegate, the actual planets IN the house create the texture of how I communicate. Mars makes it direct and fast. Saturn makes it structured and careful. Pluto makes it intense and transformative. Venus as the delegate shows WHERE and WHY I communicate (for career and reputation), but the planets in the house show HOW.”
The Interplay of Delegates and House Conditions
This example illustrates a crucial principle:
Direct Quote: “You can’t just look at the delegate and ignore what’s in the house, and you can’t just look at what’s in the house and ignore the delegate. You need BOTH. The planets in the house create the condition—the lived experience of that house. The delegate shows where those themes connect to the rest of the chart and how they’re expressed in other life areas.”

SECTION 6: DELEGATE CHAINS AND DISPOSITORSHIP NETWORKS
What Are Delegate Chains?
Direct Quote: “A delegate chain happens when one delegate rules another delegate’s house. For example, let’s say your 2nd house delegate is Mercury, and Mercury is in the 9th house. Your money comes through 9th house themes—education, philosophy, travel, foreign cultures. But then, what rules your 9th house? Let’s say Sagittarius is on the 9th house cusp, so Jupiter is the 9th house delegate. Where’s Jupiter? Jupiter is in your 5th house. Now you have a chain: 2nd house → 9th house (Mercury) → 5th house (Jupiter). Your money ultimately flows through creative expression, romance, risk-taking, children. That’s a delegate chain.”
Direct Quote: “You can trace these chains as far as they go. Some charts have very long chains where energy cascades through five or six houses before it completes the circuit. Other charts have shorter chains or multiple interconnected chains creating a network.”
Why Alchemistic Astrology Doesn’t Get Stuck
The instructor contrasts this with traditional dispositorship problems:
Direct Quote: “In traditional astrology, dispositorship creates these closed loops where planets rule each other in circles. Planet A rules Planet B, Planet B rules Planet C, Planet C rules Planet A. You’re stuck. You can’t extract useful information because it’s just circular. In Alchemistic Astrology, we don’t trace until we get stuck. We trace each connection as a LAYER of influence. Each step adds information. We’re not looking for an ‘ultimate dispositor’ or a ‘final ruler.’ We’re mapping the network of how energy flows through the chart.”
Direct Quote: “Think of it like this: traditional dispositorship is trying to find the ONE planet that’s in charge. Alchemistic delegate work is mapping the entire ecosystem of how houses talk to each other. It’s not hierarchical. It’s networked.”
Practical Application of Chains
Direct Quote: “When you’re reading a chart, you don’t have to trace every single delegate chain in minute detail every time. That would take forever. What you do is focus on the houses relevant to the question or the reading you’re doing. If someone asks about career, you look at the 10th house condition AND the 10th house delegate. If the delegate creates a chain, you follow it until you have enough information to answer the question. You don’t need to map the entire chart’s network unless you’re doing a comprehensive life analysis.”

SECTION 7: TRANSITS AND DELEGATES
Why Delegates Matter for Transit Interpretation
Direct Quote: “You cannot read transits accurately without understanding delegates. Here’s why: when a transiting planet hits your natal planet, it’s activating not just that planet, but everything that planet RULES. If transiting Jupiter conjuncts your natal Venus, and Venus rules your 7th house, that transit is activating 7th house themes—relationships, partnerships, marriage. You can’t just say ‘Jupiter conjunct Venus means expansion of beauty and pleasure.’ You have to ask: what does Venus rule? Where is Venus located? What houses is this transit connecting?”
Direct Quote: “Let’s say you have Venus in your 2nd house, and Venus rules your 7th house. Transiting Jupiter conjunct that Venus is expanding your money AND your relationships simultaneously. Those two themes are linked through the delegate. You might meet a partner who helps you financially, or a relationship might lead to new income opportunities, or your values around money might shift because of a partnership. The delegate network shows you how transits ripple through multiple life areas at once.”
Transit Activation Order
Direct Quote: “Remember how I said the order of planets in a house matters? That applies to transits too. If you have Mars, Saturn, and Pluto in your 3rd house, transits will hit them in that order as planets move through that sign. When a transit hits Mars first, your communication gets activated in a Mars way—direct, assertive, maybe aggressive. Then it hits Saturn, and you add structure or limits. Then it hits Pluto, and the intensity or transformation kicks in. The sequence matters.”
Direct Quote: “If you don’t know the order, you might see the Saturn part happening and not realize the Mars part already happened earlier, and the Pluto part is still coming. You need the whole sequence to understand the full story of what that transit is doing to your 3rd house.”
Delegates as Transit Translators
Direct Quote: “Think of delegates as translators. When a transit comes in, the delegate translates that transit’s energy into the language of the house it rules. Transiting Saturn in your 11th house, hitting your Mercury which rules your 2nd house—Saturn is bringing lessons and limits to your friendships and groups, but Mercury is translating that into money lessons. You might lose income from a group project that didn’t work out, or you might learn a hard lesson about the value of your ideas. The delegate (Mercury) shows you which house themes receive that transit’s message.”
________________


SECTION 8: EXTENSIVE Q&A SESSION
Question 1: “How do I prioritize when a house has multiple delegates?”
Direct Quote from Student: “If I have Scorpio on my 5th house cusp, so both Mars and Pluto are delegates, and they’re in completely different houses, how do I know which one to focus on? Do I read them both equally or is one more important?”
Direct Quote from Instructor: “You read them both equally. They’re not competing. They’re showing you two different dimensions of the same house. Mars as your 5th house delegate shows the active, initiating, competitive, assertive dimension of your creativity, romance, and self-expression. Pluto as your 5th house delegate shows the intense, transformative, all-or-nothing, death-and-rebirth dimension. Both are operating. Both are real. If Mars is in your 10th house, some of your creativity goes into your career. If Pluto is in your 8th house, some of your creativity involves deep transformation and maybe taboo subjects. You’re not choosing one over the other. You’re adding them together to get the complete picture.”
Question 2: “What about intercepted houses?”
Direct Quote from Student: “I have an intercepted house in my chart. How do delegates work with interceptions? Do I use the cusp ruler or the intercepted sign’s ruler?”
Direct Quote from Instructor: “Both. This is another additive situation, not either/or. The cusp ruler is the primary delegate because that’s what’s visible at the house opening. But the intercepted sign’s ruler is also active—it’s just more hidden, more internal, more difficult to access consciously. So if you have Aries on your 4th house cusp and Taurus intercepted in the 4th house, Mars is your primary 4th house delegate, but Venus is also a delegate for that hidden, internalized dimension of your home and family life. Venus might show the private, aesthetic, comfort-seeking dimension of your domestic world that you don’t express outwardly as much.”
Direct Quote from Instructor: “Interceptions always indicate energy that’s harder to access, that operates more unconsciously, or that requires more effort to integrate. The intercepted ruler is still a delegate, but it’s like a delegate that’s working behind the scenes rather than out in the open.”
Question 3: “Do cusp planets act as delegates?”
Direct Quote from Student: “If I have a planet conjunct a house cusp, does that planet become a delegate for that house, or is it only the ruler of the sign on the cusp?”
Direct Quote from Instructor: “The cusp planet is IN the house and affects the house condition, but it’s not the delegate. The delegate is always the ruler of the sign on the cusp. However, a planet conjunct a cusp has special significance because it affects BOTH houses—the house it’s technically in AND the previous house. We use Whole Signs, so if you have Venus at 29 degrees Gemini and your 4th house is Cancer, Venus is technically in the 3rd house but it’s SO close to the 4th house cusp that it bleeds into 4th house themes too. It’s influencing both.”
Direct Quote from Instructor: “This is why I always say you have to look at degrees, not just which house a planet is in. A planet at the very end of a house is already starting to carry energy for the next house. But it’s still not the delegate—it’s just creating a bridge between houses.”
Question 4: “How do nodes and asteroids work with delegates?”
Direct Quote from Student: “Do I look at delegates for my North Node or Chiron or Lilith, or is this only for planets?”
Direct Quote from Instructor: “Delegates are specifically for houses, not for points. The North Node doesn’t have a delegate—it IS a point in a house. You look at which house the North Node is in, what sign it’s in, and what that means. You also look at the ruler of the sign the North Node is in, which some people call the North Node dispositor, but that’s different from a house delegate. Same with Chiron, Lilith, asteroids—they’re points or bodies in houses, not houses themselves, so they don’t have delegates.”
Direct Quote from Instructor: “However, you CAN look at what those points RULE. For example, if Chiron is in Aries, you could say Mars is the dispositor of Chiron, showing how Chiron’s wounding and healing energy gets expressed. But that’s a different technique from house delegates.”
Question 5: “Can you explain the difference between a delegate and a dispositor?”
Direct Quote from Student: “I keep hearing both terms and I’m confused. Are they the same thing?”
Direct Quote from Instructor: “They’re related but not identical. A delegate is specifically the ruler of a house, showing where that house’s themes are expressed. A dispositor is the ruler of the SIGN a planet is in, showing what governs that planet’s expression. Let me give you an example. If you have Mars in Taurus in the 8th house, and Taurus is on your 8th house cusp, Venus is the DELEGATE of your 8th house. Venus is also the DISPOSITOR of Mars because Mars is in Venus’s sign (Taurus). Those two facts are related but describe different relationships.”
Direct Quote from Instructor: “In Alchemistic Astrology, we focus more on delegates because we’re interested in how houses connect to each other. Traditional astrology focuses more on dispositors because they’re tracing planetary dignity and essential rulerships. We use both concepts, but delegates are more central to our system.”
Question 6: “What if my delegate is in the house it rules?”
Direct Quote from Student: “I have Cancer on my 10th house cusp and the Moon is IN my 10th house. So the Moon rules the 10th and is located in the 10th. Does that change anything?”
Direct Quote from Instructor: “That’s actually very powerful. It means that house is self-contained in a way. The delegate is not sending energy somewhere else—it’s concentrated right there in its own house. Your career and public reputation (10th house) are purely lunar. The Moon isn’t dividing its energy between the 10th house and some other house. It’s ALL 10th house. You’re emotionally invested in your career, your reputation is tied to your emotional expression, your public role is nurturing or care-oriented, and your career path might fluctuate like the Moon’s phases. It’s a very direct, undiluted expression.”
Direct Quote from Instructor: “This is similar to having your ruling planet in the 1st house—it intensifies and purifies that house’s expression because there’s no displacement to another area.”
Question 7: “How do I work with empty houses in timing techniques?”
Direct Quote from Student: “If I’m looking at progressions or solar returns and a progressed planet enters an empty natal house, how do I interpret that with delegates?”
Direct Quote from Instructor: “Great question. The empty natal house still has a delegate, so when a progressed planet enters that house, it’s activating themes that were previously only expressed through the delegate’s location. Let’s say your natal 5th house is empty, with Sagittarius on the cusp, so Jupiter is your 5th house delegate and it’s in your 11th house. Your creativity, romance, and self-expression happen through groups and social networks. Now your progressed Sun enters your 5th house. Suddenly you have DIRECT 5th house activation. You’re not just expressing creativity through groups anymore—you’re becoming more personally creative, more romantically focused, more centered on your own self-expression. The delegate doesn’t disappear, but now you have an additional layer of direct energy.”
Direct Quote from Instructor: “Same with solar returns. If your solar return has planets in a house that’s empty natally, that year will emphasize those house themes more directly than usual.”
Question 8: “Should I use the same delegate technique for derived houses?”
Direct Quote from Student: “When I’m reading derived houses—like treating my 7th house as the 1st house of my partner—do I use delegates the same way?”
Direct Quote from Instructor: “Yes, absolutely. Derived houses follow the same rules as natal houses. If you’re reading your 7th house as your partner’s 1st house (their identity), you look at what’s in the 7th house for the condition, and then you find the delegate by looking at what sign is on your 7th house cusp and where that ruler is located. That shows you how your partner’s identity manifests in the context of your relationship. Same process, just rotated.”
Direct Quote from Instructor: “This gets complex quickly because you’re layering derived houses on top of your natal houses, so you’re tracking multiple delegate networks simultaneously. But the principle stays the same.”
Question 9: “What about progressions of the delegates themselves?”
Direct Quote from Student: “If my 2nd house delegate is progressing into a different house, does that shift where my money comes from?”
Direct Quote from Instructor: “Yes! Progressed delegates can change houses over time, and that absolutely shifts how those house themes manifest. If your natal Mercury is in the 3rd house and it’s your 2nd house delegate, your money comes through communication, writing, teaching, short-distance travel, siblings. But if Mercury progresses into your 4th house over time, your money sources might shift to involve home, family, real estate, domestic businesses. Progressed delegates show the evolution of how house themes express themselves across your lifetime.”
Direct Quote from Instructor: “This is one reason why progressions are so powerful for showing internal development. Your natal chart shows the original blueprint, but progressions show how you’re growing and changing that blueprint’s expression.”
Question 10: “How do delegates work in synastry?”
Direct Quote from Student: “When I’m comparing two charts, do I look at where my delegates fall in my partner’s houses?”
Direct Quote from Instructor: “Yes, that’s one layer. If your 7th house delegate (the planet that rules your relationship house) falls in your partner’s 5th house, your approach to partnership activates their creativity, romance, and pleasure sector. You make them feel more playful and expressive. But you also look at where THEIR 7th house delegate is, and whether your delegates aspect each other, and whether one person’s delegate conjuncts the other person’s planets. It creates a web of interconnections.”
Direct Quote from Instructor: “Synastry is already complex, and adding delegates makes it more layered, but it’s worth it because you see exactly HOW the two charts communicate with each other through the delegate networks. You’re not just looking at ‘Venus conjunct Mars’—you’re looking at ‘your 2nd house delegate conjuncts their 8th house delegate, creating a financial and intimacy connection,’ which is much more specific.”

SECTION 9: ADVANCED APPLICATIONS
Using Delegates for Electional Astrology
Direct Quote: “When you’re choosing a time to start something important—launching a business, getting married, signing a contract—you want to make sure the relevant delegates are well-placed. If you’re starting a business, you want your 2nd house delegate (money) and 10th house delegate (career) to be in strong positions, making harmonious aspects, not retrograde, not afflicted. If you’re getting married, you want your 7th house delegate in a supportive house and sign, making good aspects.”
Direct Quote: “This is more nuanced than just saying ‘pick a time when Venus is strong’ because Venus might not rule your 7th house. If Aquarius is on your 7th house cusp, Uranus is your 7th house delegate, and you need to make sure URANUS is well-placed for a marriage election, not necessarily Venus.”
Using Delegates for Career Analysis
Direct Quote: “The 10th house is your career and public reputation, but the 10th house DELEGATE shows you HOW you build that career and reputation. If your 10th house delegate is in the 3rd house, your career comes through communication, writing, teaching, media, connections with siblings or neighbors. If your 10th house delegate is in the 8th house, your career involves other people’s money, transformation, psychology, research, possibly taboo subjects. The delegate tells you the pathway.”
Direct Quote: “You also want to look at the condition of the 10th house itself—what planets are there, what aspects they make—and combine that with the delegate’s position. The planets in the house show the qualities of your career and reputation. The delegate shows the avenue through which you access that career.”
Using Delegates for Health Analysis
Direct Quote: “The 6th house is daily health, routines, and service. The 8th house is major health issues, surgeries, chronic conditions, and regeneration. The 12th house is hidden health issues, hospitals, and convalescence. If you’re doing health astrology, you need to look at all three of those houses, their conditions, and their delegates.”
Direct Quote: “Let’s say someone has an empty 6th house with Pisces on the cusp. Jupiter and Neptune are the 6th house delegates. Where are they? If Jupiter is in the 1st house, health issues manifest in the physical body and vitality. If Neptune is in the 12th house, health issues have a hidden or psychological component. You’d counsel this person to pay attention to mind-body connection, spiritual health practices, and not ignoring subtle symptoms.”
Using Delegates for Relationship Analysis
Direct Quote: “The 7th house is marriage and committed partnerships. The 5th house is romance, dating, and casual relationships. The 8th house is sexual intimacy and deep bonding. The 11th house is friendship. For a complete relationship analysis, you need to look at all four houses, their conditions, and their delegates.”
Direct Quote: “Someone might have a very active 5th house with lots of planets, showing lots of romantic experiences, but an empty 7th house. That suggests they enjoy dating but might find commitment more challenging or might express commitment differently than expected. You’d look at the 7th house delegate to see where and how commitment manifests for them.”
Direct Quote: “I’ve seen charts where the 7th house delegate is in the 11th house, and these people truly marry their best friend. The 7th house delegate in the 6th house can indicate a partner who becomes a coworker or someone you meet through work. The 7th house delegate in the 12th house might mean a partner who’s foreign, spiritual, or someone you have a very private relationship with.”
________________


SECTION 10: COMMON MISTAKES AND CORRECTIONS
Mistake 1: Ignoring Empty Houses
Direct Quote: “The biggest mistake I see is people thinking empty houses mean nothing happens in that life area. ‘I have an empty 4th house so I don’t have family issues.’ Wrong. You absolutely have family issues—you just have to look at the 4th house delegate to see where and how they show up. Empty houses are not inactive. They’re just delegated to another location.”
Mistake 2: Not Checking Planet Order
Direct Quote: “People look at a house and say ‘I have Sun, Moon, and Mercury in my 9th house’ and they don’t check the order by degree. That matters! Is it Sun-Moon-Mercury, or Moon-Sun-Mercury, or Mercury-Moon-Sun? The sequence changes the lived experience. You express those planets in that order. Transits hit them in that order. You have to know the order.”
Mistake 3: Reading Charts “Forward” Only
Direct Quote: “People trace energy in one direction—‘My 1st house delegate is in the 10th, so my identity goes into my career’—and they stop there. But remember, it’s bidirectional. Yes, your identity goes into your career, but your career experiences also shape your identity. Your public reputation feeds back into your sense of self. You can’t just read it one way. The delegate creates a two-way bridge.”
Mistake 4: Creating False Hierarchies
Direct Quote: “I see people trying to rank delegates by importance. ‘Which is the MOST important delegate?’ There isn’t one. They all matter. Your 1st house delegate isn’t more important than your 7th house delegate just because the 1st house is ‘about you.’ All houses are about you. All delegates contribute to your chart’s functioning. Don’t create hierarchies that don’t exist.”
Mistake 5: Forgetting Cusp Planets Affect Both Houses
Direct Quote: “When a planet is conjunct a house cusp—especially within a few degrees—it affects the previous house too, not just the house it’s technically in. People forget this and only read the planet in one house. If you have Mars at 29 degrees of a sign and the next sign starts a new house, Mars is already reaching into that next house. It’s creating a bridge. You have to account for both influences.”
Mistake 6: Over-Simplifying Dual Rulers
Direct Quote: “With Scorpio, Aquarius, and Pisces, you have two rulers. Some people arbitrarily pick one—‘I only use Mars for Scorpio, I don’t believe in Pluto’—and they’re cutting themselves off from half the information. Both rulers are real. Both are active. Both are delegates if that sign is on a house cusp. You need both perspectives or you’re missing the full picture.”
Mistake 7: Not Integrating House Conditions with Delegates
Direct Quote: “You can’t analyze a house by ONLY looking at the delegate and ignoring what’s actually IN the house, and you can’t analyze it by ONLY looking at what’s in the house and ignoring the delegate. You need both. The planets in the house create the texture and quality of the experience. The delegate shows where those experiences connect to other life areas. Both are essential.”
________________


SECTION 11: INTEGRATION WITH OTHER ALCHEMISTIC CONCEPTS
Delegates and Aspect Spectrum
Direct Quote: “When you’re working with Aspect Spectrum—the journey from applying to separating aspects—you have to consider delegates because aspects between delegates connect houses. If your 2nd house delegate and your 10th house delegate are in aspect, your money and career are linked through that aspect. If it’s an applying aspect, the connection is building. If it’s separating, the connection is completing or has already happened.”
Direct Quote: “Planet One and Planet Two in an aspect—Planet One initiates, Planet Two receives—and if those planets are delegates for different houses, you’re seeing exactly how one life area initiates energy into another life area. It’s incredibly precise.”
Delegates and True Placements (Base & Spark)
Direct Quote: “Your Base is where your Sun is by degree, and your Spark is the opposite degree. Both create sensitive points in your chart. When a delegate lands on or near your Base or Spark, that house’s themes become central to your core identity and life purpose. If your 10th house delegate is conjunct your Base, your career is absolutely fundamental to who you are—you’re here to build something public and significant. If your 4th house delegate is conjunct your Spark, family and roots are the activation point that challenges you to grow.”
Delegates and Reverse Vantage
Direct Quote: “Reverse Vantage is looking at your chart from the opposite perspective—flipping everything 180 degrees. When you do this, delegates remain consistent because they’re based on house cusps, and house cusps don’t change. But the THEMES you emphasize shift. If you’re normally focused on your 1st house delegate (identity), Reverse Vantage asks you to look at your 7th house delegate (partnership) as the starting point. What if relationships are the lens through which you understand yourself? That’s Reverse Vantage with delegates.”
Delegates and Stellium Analysis
Direct Quote: “A stellium in one house creates a major emphasis in that life area, and the delegate for that stellium house becomes incredibly important because it’s channeling ALL that concentrated energy somewhere else in the chart. If you have a stellium in your 8th house, your 8th house delegate is carrying all that Scorpionic, transformative, intense, death-and-rebirth energy to wherever it’s located. That makes the delegate’s position hyper-significant.”

SECTION 12: PRACTICAL TIPS FOR APP DEVELOPMENT
Data Requirements for Delegate Calculations
To implement delegate functionality in the astrology app, the following data points must be captured and calculated:
Input Data:
                                                                                                                                                      * Birth date, time, and location (for house cusp calculation)
                                                                                                                                                      * House system (Whole Signs in Alchemistic Astrology)
                                                                                                                                                      * Planetary positions by house and sign
                                                                                                                                                      * Planetary positions by degree (for order determination)
Calculation Steps:
                                                                                                                                                      1. Generate House Cusps:

                                                                                                                                                         * Calculate 12 house cusps using Whole Signs system
                                                                                                                                                         * Assign sign to each house cusp (Ascendant sign = 1st house, next sign = 2nd house, etc.)
                                                                                                                                                         2. Identify Delegate for Each House:

SECTION 13: SUMMARY & KEY TAKEAWAYS
Core Concepts to Remember
1. Delegates Are Planetary Representatives of Entire Houses
                                                                                                                                                                           * Not just “rulers” in traditional sense
                                                                                                                                                                           * Carry ALL house themes to wherever they’re located

Most Important Quotes
Direct Quote: “A delegate is the planetary ruler of a house that acts as the representative or ambassador for that entire house’s energy. It’s not just a ‘house ruler’ in the traditional sense—the delegate actively embodies and transmits all the themes of that house wherever it’s located in your chart.”
Direct Quote: “House conditions are the sum of everything in the house. Not just which planets are there, but what ORDER they’re in by degree, what aspects they make to each other, whether they’re retrograde, whether they’re conjunct—everything. The house condition is the complete energetic environment of that life area.”
Direct Quote: “Empty houses are NOT inactive. This is one of the biggest mistakes people make. An empty house just means you look to the delegate—the ruler of that house—to see where those themes are playing out.”
Direct Quote: “You cannot read transits accurately without understanding delegates. When a transiting planet hits your natal planet, it’s activating not just that planet, but everything that planet RULES.”
Direct Quote: “The ORDER of planets in a house matters tremendously. If you don’t know the order, you don’t have astrology.”

Direct Quote: “If you understand delegates and house conditions, you understand 80% of how to read a chart. Everything else is refinement and detail. But this—this is the skeleton, the framework, the structure that holds everything else together.”
Final Technical Note
For App Implementation:
The delegate and house condition system must be automatically calculated and displayed for every chart generated. Users should be able to:

OVERVIEW
This transcript introduces the Lenses framework—one of the most revolutionary concepts in Alchemistic Astrology. Lenses are interpretive perspectives or thematic frameworks through which the entire chart is read, depending on the specific question or life area being explored. Rather than reading charts in a generic, one-size-fits-all manner, the Lenses approach allows practitioners to dynamically shift focus, emphasizing different houses, planets, and rulerships based on context.
The Core Innovation: Traditional astrology tends to compartmentalize life themes into isolated houses or planets (e.g., “love = Venus/7th house,” “career = 10th house”). Lenses reveal that this reductionism misses the holistic, interconnected nature of chart interpretation. Every life theme involves multiple houses, planets, signs, and their relationships—and the lens you apply determines which connections you emphasize.
Key Learning Objectives:
                                                                                                                                                                           * Understand what lenses are and why they’re essential for accurate interpretation
                                                                                                                                                                           * Master the technical process of applying different lenses to the same chart
                                                                                                                                                                           * Learn all major lens types (Home, Career, Money, Mental Health, Fitness, Nutrition, Self-Love, Spirituality, Hobbies, Relationships, Community, Business)
                                                                                                                                                                           * Recognize how the same chart reveals entirely different insights under different lenses
                                                                                                                                                                           * Integrate lenses with other Alchemistic concepts (delegates, aspects, progressions, relocations)
                                                                                                                                                                           * Develop question-driven interpretation skills for practical client work

                                                                                                                                                                           * Builds on house and planetary foundations (Transcripts 1-3)
                                                                                                                                                                           * Provides the interpretive framework for applying delegates and house conditions (Transcript 13)
                                                                                                                                                                           * Integrates with Aspect Spectrum, True Placements, and Reverse Vantage techniques
                                                                                                                                                                           * Essential for practical application of all theoretical knowledge

SECTION 1: THE ARCHETYPE PROBLEM & FOUNDATIONAL PHILOSOPHY
The Crisis in Traditional Astrology
The instructor opens by addressing a fundamental problem in how astrology is commonly practiced:
Direct Quote: “In astrology, we tend to forget when we give the names of archetypes to planets and houses specifically, we start forgetting that everything has to work together. One of the key components of alchemistic astrology is the understanding that we’re not dealing with definitions and we’re not dealing with placements; those are building blocks for a bigger picture. We’re looking at everything, the entire chart, and more importantly, the relationship of energies to each other that create color theory. It creates the unique blend and mixture of energies that create or comprise you, a situation, an event, whatever you’re looking at.”
The Reductionism Trap:
Direct Quote: “So one of the things people get hung up on is they’ll say, oh, love and relationships. If I want to know about love, I go to Venus or I go to the seventh house…And it’s like, yes, for certain parts of it, but love is not just how you relate to another person; it’s not just the conversation you have…These are things in the seventh house. It’s not just the diplomacy, the tactfulness, and the give-and-take nature of things to keep things in balance; there’s so much more that goes into it, and understanding the myriad of things that you can extract from the thematic expressions of each planet, each energy—which includes the signs and the houses—is going to help you understand what component that is.”
This reductionism creates several problems:
                                                                                                                                                                           1. Incomplete Interpretations - Looking only at Venus for love ignores purpose (5th house), depth (8th house), communication (3rd house), values (2nd house)
                                                                                                                                                                           2. Missing Context - Chart features appear random when read in isolation
                                                                                                                                                                           3. Loss of Personalization - Generic keyword meanings don’t capture individual chart uniqueness
                                                                                                                                                                           4. Inability to Answer Specific Questions - “Tell me about my chart” is too vague; “How do I find community within my hobbies?” requires precise lens application
What ARE Lenses?
Core Definition:
Direct Quote: “Basically, what we’re doing is looking at an astrology chart, a natal chart, an electional chart, a business chart, a transit report, anything like that, and we’re trying to understand what is it we’re actually looking at.”
Direct Quote: “But what if we were to get into the house itself and we wanted to break down the house? Well, now we’re not talking about life on an abstract level; we’re going in with a magnifying glass on the house…You’re looking at the lens of house and home. So what you have to do is you have to step back for a second and you have to think, what are all the archetypes? What are all the energies you’re dealing with?”
Lenses are:
                                                                                                                                                                           * Thematic frameworks for organizing chart interpretation around specific life areas
                                                                                                                                                                           * Perspective-shifting tools that emphasize different chart features based on the question
                                                                                                                                                                           * Holistic synthesis methods that integrate multiple houses, planets, and rulerships
                                                                                                                                                                           * Question-driven approaches that make interpretation practical and actionable
                                                                                                                                                                           * Dynamic rather than static - the same chart reveals different stories through different lenses
Direct Quote: “This works really well for people who are trying to, like, you want to understand what you need in a house and home. You’re going to look at your natal chart, your progressions, and your relocations, and combine those energies in a layered format to get the full big picture of it. But if you’re somebody who’s actually into real estate, it tells you what type of, what type of house to use, um, what, where you’re going to invest your money, how to get your money out of it, what you need to do to the house, because you might have a million of them, you know, these amazing ideas, but they may not bring you…They may not bring you any money.”
The “Color Theory” Concept
Direct Quote: “We’re looking at everything, the entire chart, and more importantly, the relationship of energies to each other that create color theory. It creates the unique blend and mixture of energies that create or comprise you, a situation, an event, whatever you’re looking at.”
This “color theory” metaphor is crucial:
                                                                                                                                                                           * Just as colors blend to create infinite shades, planetary energies combine uniquely in each chart
                                                                                                                                                                           * No two charts with the same placements produce identical results because relationships between energies matter more than isolated placements
                                                                                                                                                                           * Lenses help you see which color combinations are relevant for specific questions
                                                                                                                                                                           * The same “colors” (planets/houses) create different effects depending on context (lens)
Why Lenses Matter: The Practical Problem
Direct Quote: “And if we were just to say, oh, the house, the fourth house of this chart is the house, we would have no information; we would have no data. You might have the ruler; through alchemistic astrology, you’ll definitely have the bi-directionality of the ruler. So essentially, coming into this specific chart again, I start with my chart, but we can always use other charts along the way in a rotating fashion.”
Without lenses:
                                                                                                                                                                           * You identify placements but don’t know what they mean for the specific question
                                                                                                                                                                           * You see energy flows but can’t prioritize which ones matter for the client’s concern
                                                                                                                                                                           * You can describe chart features but can’t synthesize them into actionable guidance
                                                                                                                                                                           * You give generic readings that sound like horoscopes rather than personalized insight
With lenses:
                                                                                                                                                                           * Every chart feature becomes meaningful in context
                                                                                                                                                                           * You can answer “How does my chart affect my career?” with precision
                                                                                                                                                                           * You provide specific, actionable guidance tailored to the question
                                                                                                                                                                           * You avoid the “throw everything at the wall” approach of generic readings

SECTION 2: FUNDAMENTAL LENS MECHANICS
The Basic Process: How to Apply a Lens
Direct Quote: “So, whenever you’re picking a lens, you’re always still starting to the general themes of that area, because we’re still talking about that person in their entire chart. But then when we look at the lens in terms of the components of that, we have to reach out beyond that.”
Step-by-Step Lens Application:
                                                                                                                                                                           1. Identify the Question/Theme

                                                                                                                                                                              * What is the client asking about?
                                                                                                                                                                              * What life area are they trying to understand?
                                                                                                                                                                              * What decision or challenge are they facing?
                                                                                                                                                                              2. Select the Primary House/Planet/Sign

                                                                                                                                                                                 * Start with the traditional house associated with that theme
                                                                                                                                                                                 * Example: Career → 6th house (daily work), 10th house (long-term goals)
                                                                                                                                                                                 * Example: Home → 4th house, Moon, Cancer
                                                                                                                                                                                 3. Trace the Rulership Chain

                                                                                                                                                                                    * Identify the sign on the house cusp

The Order of Reading: Natal, Relocation, Progression
Direct Quote: “You always read the natal chart first; that is your baseline energies. And then, to understand the phases of life, you will go into the progressions. And then, if you’ve moved, you’re gonna add the relocations. I would, the order I would do it would actually be natal chart relocations. I would read those two together, and then I would go into the progressions to see where you are in life. Because if your energy is completely different, we have to add that in there.”
Layering Technique:
                                                                                                                                                                                             1. Natal Chart - The fundamental blueprint, unchanging baseline
                                                                                                                                                                                             2. Relocation Chart - Adds context if person has moved (house cusps shift)
                                                                                                                                                                                             3. Progressions - Shows current life phase and evolution of themes
This layered approach allows you to see:
                                                                                                                                                                                             * What’s inherent vs. what’s environmental
                                                                                                                                                                                             * What’s permanent vs. what’s temporary
                                                                                                                                                                                             * What’s potential vs. what’s activated now
Avoiding Confirmation Bias
Direct Quote: “I’m reading it; I’m actually being extremely objective and unbiased when I read this, so I’m not reading it as though, oh, I know this. I’m letting that kind of compound afterwards. I’m reading this as though this is somebody else’s chart. When you guys get into reading your own charts, you want to do that as well. You wanna do your best to be like, I’m gonna pretend that this is not me because it can be very easy for you to get hung up on making it make sense and, you know, basically confirmation bias as opposed to actually reading the chart.”
Critical Discipline:
                                                                                                                                                                                             * Read objectively, as if the chart belongs to a stranger
                                                                                                                                                                                             * Let insights emerge from the chart rather than forcing them to match expectations
                                                                                                                                                                                             * Avoid cherry-picking placements that confirm preexisting beliefs
                                                                                                                                                                                             * Allow the chart to challenge your assumptions

SECTION 3: THE COMPLETE LENS INVENTORY
Lens #1: HOUSE AND HOME
Primary Focus: 4th house, Moon, Cancer, home-related sign rulers
What This Lens Answers:
                                                                                                                                                                                             * What do I need in a home to feel secure?
                                                                                                                                                                                             * Where should I live for optimal well-being?
                                                                                                                                                                                             * What’s my relationship with family and roots?
                                                                                                                                                                                             * How do domestic issues manifest in my life?
                                                                                                                                                                                             * For real estate investors: What properties suit me? Where to invest?
Technical Process:
Direct Quote: “So for instance, we’ve talked about like the house; if you go home, you open the front door, and you go in your home. In astrology, we know that generally speaking, the home, the house itself, and where you feel safe is cancer energy. It is the fourth house; it is the moon in your chart. Those are synonymous, those three. And when you’re just talking about it as a generalized theme, that’s what it is. But what if we were to get into the house itself and we wanted to break down the house? Well, now we’re not talking about life on an abstract level; we’re going in with a magnifying glass on the house.”
Example from Instructor’s Chart (Leo Rising):
Direct Quote: “In this fourth house, we know that the ruler goes into the third house. We know that Jupiter sits there, and it’s the ruler of the fifth house. So three, four, and five in a reverse order are tying in. The fifth house ruler, Jupiter, is in the fourth house. The fourth house is in Scorpio. The Scorpio’s ruler, Pluto, is in the third house. So it goes from five to four to three, and that order obviously matters.”
Real-Life Manifestation:
Direct Quote: “I was living in section eight housing, I was born in poverty, and all that good stuff. And my birth mother lived on a pullout couch in the living room. My sister and I were in the one bedroom that was in that apartment; it was very small.”
The chart reveals why: Pluto (trauma, intensity) ruling the 4th house (home), located in the 3rd house (siblings, early environment), with Jupiter (expansion, but also excess) in the 4th creating both chaos and protection.
Component Sub-Lens: Windows
The instructor demonstrates how you can zoom into specific components of a house:
Direct Quote: “So when you are looking for windows, we’ll just start there, right? You start breaking down the different components of the house, and you start thinking, what are windows? What energy represents windows? Well, to understand that, if you haven’t already figured this out, you have to think about what are windows. Windows are things that have a reflection or can have a reflection. They are things that are clear, transparent. You can see through them; they can get foggy. What are the general traits of a window and what energy represents them? Windows are represented by Pisces energy for those exact reasons.”
Direct Quote: “The reflection that you can get from a mirror, which is also Neptune, but also windows, comes from the seventh house quincunx into the twelfth house…So, you’re looking here, and the 12th house is in Cancer. So, there would be some sort of personal ethereal connection with windows, with anything that has to do with things that you can see through or reflective surfaces like that.”
Real Manifestation:
Direct Quote: “One of the things that happened quite often is there would either be bullets, rocks, or glass bottles that were thrown through the window, and they would shatter…And that’s probably because Vesta is here and just kind of kept it intact. So that energy shows right here in my chart. I’ve always had these kinds of like things happen…The film studio that I got in up there in Silmar, my first film studio had a bullet hole that was like in the, in the window…And then there was another one from a BB gun that happened later, and it actually held it in attack and it didn’t fully break either, but it did start splitting the window there…The house in Florida also had one on the big bay window in the front, so those were, were pretty common.”
Mold Around Windows:
Direct Quote: “The eighth house has to do with mold…look around the windows. By the way, I don’t know if you guys caught this, but Ashley and I were talking about; we think there might be mold in the house…However, around the windows, there is mold forming in certain areas within the bedroom where our children sleep.”
This demonstrates the incredible specificity possible with lenses—not just “what’s my 4th house like?” but “Why do I keep having window problems?” and finding precise astrological indicators.

                                                                                                                                                                                             * What’s my relationship with routine and service?
                                                                                                                                                                                             * How do I function as an employee?
Technical Distinction:
Direct Quote: “For work and career, as you’re looking at a chart, remember, we would normally go to, oh, work is the sixth house, and we definitely start there. Like it’s important to realize that I’m not saying that’s not where we start. You absolutely do start there, so whenever you’re picking a lens, you’re always still starting to the general themes of that area…But then when we look at the lens in terms of the components of that, we have to reach out beyond that.”
The Ascendant Always Matters:
Direct Quote: “Every single lens, in terms of anything that’s going to be actionable…you’re always looking at the ascendant as well. Every single thing is always going to come back to the ascendant and then wherever the ascendant is and anything else in the first house. The ascendant for this chart is in the Jupiter decan of Leo, which goes into the 11th house.”
Example from Instructor’s Chart:
6th House Analysis:
 Direct Quote: “We have the sixth house, there’s the south node, there is an ascendant quincunx to the south node, which can be challenging, obviously, and you guys are crazy in the comments. The energy that’s sitting here with Lilith, and then Juno in retrograde, this has to do with commitment issues with work…”
No major planets in 6th, so look to ruler:
 Direct Quote: “We go to rulership; it leads us into the third house where we do not have a stellium…”
3rd House (Coworkers, Communication):
 Contains Saturn retrograde, Pluto retrograde, Mars—creating complexity around communication, authority, and workplace relationships.
Real-Life Work History:
Direct Quote: “I’ve done a lot of jobs, hundreds of jobs, but there are four companies that I worked for before I became a full-on entrepreneur…RadioShack, AT&T, Sprint, Verizon, they’re all cell phone companies, and what I did on a daily basis was communication through conversation.”
The Gemini/11th House Connection:
Direct Quote: “The ascendant for this chart is in the Jupiter decan of Leo, which goes into the 11th house. So, no matter what lens you’re talking about, there’s always going to be something different; it’s always going to be something tech-oriented.”
This explains why all jobs involved technology (11th house) and communication (3rd house), with teams and social dynamics (11th house groups).
Sales Technique Example:
Direct Quote: “Me and my friend, 11th house, his name is Devar…we would co-sign on each other’s sales…this is Gemini, this banter…I would jump in and be like, oh yeah, cause if you don’t have that, you need this, this, and this…he would do the same thing for me…And it was like we were finishing each other’s sentences and making you guys laugh or like building rapport while he was doing it. He kept you on the hook while I was doing it. And we just made these massive sales.”
Conflict with Authority:
Direct Quote: “For me, my ideas always conflicted with authority because the third house rulers up here with Chiron, and then it is in a quincunx to Saturn and retrograde…”
The Sales Walk Rebellion:
Direct Quote: “I was in this office in Columbia, Maryland, with my two assistant managers, my store manager, the regional manager, the district manager, and the tech manager…telling me that I’ve been a problem for a long time…And then I challenged the regional. I said, …you take the next customer; you show me that the sales walk works. And then I’ll take the customer after that…She got nothing…I took the next one and closed the 12-line business deal…they ended up ditching the sales walk because of that, and I ended up becoming a trainer that went from store to store.”
This perfectly illustrates 3rd house (communication, challenging systems) conflicting with 10th house authority (Chiron = the wound around achievement/authority).
Lens #3: BUSINESS AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP
Primary Focus: 10th house (authority, structure, goals), 6th house (reframed as employees, not self as employee), 7th house (business partners, legal contracts), 3rd house (communication, ideas)
Critical Distinction from Career Lens:
Direct Quote: “Is there a difference between a career lens and building a business…Yes, because your overall focus is, whether or not…they’re subtly different. Whether you’re working for yourself or you’re working for somebody else is gonna be very important.”
How Houses Shift Meaning:
Direct Quote: “Now, if you’re working for yourself, the likelihood for most entrepreneurs is that you don’t have any coworkers, so this house, you’re not gonna be looking for coworkers anymore; you’re just gonna be looking for communication…When you are running your own business, the Sixth House becomes your employees. Do you have employees? How does that work? Does it work?”
7th House Becomes Business Partners:
Direct Quote: “In the Seventh House…how your relationship is with your own business. That’s added now in the Seventh House when you’re talking about your own business.”
Instructor’s Business Experience:
Direct Quote: “When I try to be the manager of everything, it’s too much…I have to have a team; I always have to have a team because when I try to be the manager of everything, it’s too much…same thing happens with…TikTok…Mystic Rebels…when Ashley comes in and kind of shows the other side of it and takes over some of the responsibilities…Mystic Rebels is flourishing.”
This demonstrates that even with strong 10th house (Chiron demanding achievement), the chart shows need for team (11th house emphasis) rather than solo management.
Lens #4: MONEY AND FINANCE
Primary Focus: 2nd house (value, resources, earning), 11th house (income, variety), 8th house (shared resources, others’ money), 1st house (how you take action to earn)
What This Lens Answers:
                                                                                                                                                                                             * How do I make money?
                                                                                                                                                                                             * What’s my relationship with resources and value?
                                                                                                                                                                                             * Where do financial opportunities come from?
                                                                                                                                                                                             * What are my spending patterns?
                                                                                                                                                                                             * How do I handle money management?
The Action Component:
Direct Quote: “So, for instance, if you’re looking at money overall and you’re looking at money as a lens, so basically you’re looking at money and finance. So you’re looking at the first house when you are going to, what are you going to do that is going to be the activity that’s going to bring you money? That’s the first house. How does money start? How does money happen?”
Example from Instructor’s Chart:
Direct Quote: “The value part of it is through, you know, details, through, you know, analyzing things, through, you know, getting to the numbers as they project out in the real world, and then the services. And then that leads into the 11th house of being different, of, you know, going above and beyond, of, again, technology…”
2nd House Ruler in Retrograde:
Direct Quote: “Because my second house ruler is up here in retrograde in the Gemini decan of Gemini, and in opposition to my seventh house…”
Multiple Income Streams:
Direct Quote: “The retrograde is, you know, you have to pull those things inward; you can’t just project them outward…when I had my film stuff, when I did the fetish film stuff, we had something called custom orders…then what I would do is to get more money out of the same thing, which is retrograde in increments, which is the 11th house energy. I would say, Hey, let’s offer partial customs…and then basically off of the same thing that I was making money off of, I would get this plus this plus this plus this and quadruple my income. This is why I was so successful doing it; it’s actually sitting there in my chart.”
Gemini = Dual Income:
 The instructor earned money through hourly wages + commission, perfectly reflecting Gemini energy (duality, two sources).
Financial Quirks:
Direct Quote: “I’m always rounding up. So if something is two dollars and 1 cents, I round up to $3. If something is 10 dollars and $0.01, I round up to eleven…And then whenever I take in income, I round down…That’s my Chiron in the 10th. Always undershooting my estimate of how much I’m going to make.”
This financial behavior is directly readable in the chart through the money lens—showing how specific and personalized lens work becomes.
Lens #5: MENTAL HEALTH
Primary Focus: 6th house (health, mind-body connection), 3rd house (neurology, mental processing), Mercury/Virgo (analytical mind)
Critical Correction of Common Misconception:
Direct Quote: “Mental health is one that you’re gonna get a lot of. First place you always look for mental health is where? A lot of people think it’s the 12th house in Neptune; it is not. What was that? Sixth, yes. The sixth house is where you’re gonna look. Why do we say the sixth house? For anybody that has taken all the classes, you know that the sixth house is naturally Virgo ruled. Virgo is ruled by Mercury. On the outward analytical side of it, the earth expression of it, the reality expression of it. And because it rules our health…”
The 3rd/6th Connection:
Direct Quote: “It goes along with the herbalism physiology that Ashley will be teaching pretty soon, that there are multiple brains in the body, the digestive system having one of them. So you have your head brain, and then you have your digestive brain, and that digestive brain is what contributes to the real world…your sixth house is also all the details.”
Stress and Squares:
Direct Quote: “So these two houses contribute to stress; stress contributes naturally through a square harshly…the third house, the sixth house, and the ninth house, with the 12th house all contributing in different levels to each other.”
Example from Instructor’s Chart:
Direct Quote: “In my South node being in the sixth house, I am naturally akin to that stress. So it gives me that, that superpower. It’s like, no matter how stressed I am, for the most part, I can handle more stress than most people, but I’m not supposed to, you’re not supposed to, we are not supposed to do that.”
Direct Quote: “My mental health always comes from overdoing stress from emotional trauma that’s trapped…All these retrogrades basically tell you that I put that stress on myself.”
Important Guidance:
Direct Quote: “Just because you CAN handle high stress doesn’t mean you SHOULD. The chart shows capacity but also warns of danger.”
Lens #6: FITNESS (Physical Body)
Primary Focus: 1st house (how you take action), 5th house (recreation, fun, purpose), 8th house (intensity, transformation)
What This Lens Answers:
                                                                                                                                                                                             * What type of exercise suits me?
                                                                                                                                                                                             * How intense should my workouts be?
                                                                                                                                                                                             * What’s my approach to physical transformation?
                                                                                                                                                                                             * Where are my physical strengths and vulnerabilities?
Technical Process:
Direct Quote: “So, fitness is one that you’re gonna get a lot of. First place you always look for fitness is where?..Once you get into fitness, you say, okay, fifth house is fitness. First house is how I do it.”
The Intensity Factor (8th House):
Direct Quote: “The eighth house is other people’s resources, but it’s also intensity. So it’s going to be, how intense are your workouts? And what type of workouts are going to give you the most benefit that is going to lead into the transformation of your physical body?”
Example from Instructor’s Chart:
Direct Quote: “Leo Rising’s base for the intensity is not intense unless that eighth house ruler’s back in the eighth house or related to Pluto…What would work really well for you would be either like hit training or something that really gets your heart going to a point where it’s like pounding a little bit. We just have to make sure it doesn’t overdo it.”
Variety Matters:
Direct Quote: “My motivations behind doing into something different, it can’t be the same every single time. There has to be some sort of hands element in there, but also some sort of mental, um, involvement in what I’m doing.”
Lens #7: NUTRITION
Primary Focus: Ceres (asteroid for nurturing/food), 2nd house (value, resources, what you consume), 6th house (health, daily habits), 4th house (comfort, emotional nourishment)
What This Lens Answers:
                                                                                                                                                                                             * What dietary approach suits my body?
                                                                                                                                                                                             * What are my eating patterns and needs?
                                                                                                                                                                                             * How do I relate to food emotionally?
                                                                                                                                                                                             * What foods support or harm my health?
Example from Instructor’s Chart:
Direct Quote: “Nutrition, same thing. What is good for your body? Ceres is a big part of this, which I’m not gonna dive into right now. But when we get into Ceres, this is literal nutrition, like physical nurturing in terms of nutrition and things you physically do for taking care of yourself and taking care of other people on a physical level, nurturing…The value that you’re gonna get, and the resources and the types of food, is gonna be here in the second house. And again, for this one, it points again into the 11th house, which is all about that variety. It’s all about like small foods. This person is going to be a snacker because the third house going into Gemini in the 11th, so you would have to utilize that energy and realize that this person needs to snack.”
Real-Life Pattern:
Direct Quote: “I would have my bigger meals around the time I was doing physical activity, but then we would always have smaller meals and supplemental snacks…I had to do it that way. I couldn’t do the like three or four meals a day. It just doesn’t work that way. There are people who can, and it will show that in their chart.”
Lens #8: SELF-LOVE AND SELF-WORTH
Primary Focus: 2nd house (self-value), Venus (self-love), 4th house (nurturing, self-care), 1st house (sense of identity)
What This Lens Answers:
                                                                                                                                                                                             * Where does my self-worth come from?
                                                                                                                                                                                             * How do I build confidence?
                                                                                                                                                                                             * What damages my self-esteem?
                                                                                                                                                                                             * How do I practice self-care?
Technical Process:
Direct Quote: “Self-love is always gonna start with the second house because it is your self-value…But when it comes to nurturing, being nurtured, those types of things, there’s gonna be a varying level of self-care and through the sextile, you’ll have to figure out how much of the fourth house you’re gonna feed into the second house.”
The Identity Connection:
Direct Quote: “For me, my mental health is tied into my self-worth and my self-value as a Leo rising…Sense of identity is going to lead directly or is going to be contributed to directly by your sense of self-worth and value.”
Grand Trine Example:
Direct Quote: “And the grand trine, I didn’t talk about the grand trines before, but the grand trine from there is gonna lead into your mental health. Your mental health is gonna lead into your sense of stability and your long-term goals and sense of achievement and what you’ve done over time, which should lead directly back in. It should tell you what to do to lead back into your own sense of self-worth.”
Lens #9: SPIRITUALITY, FAITH, BELIEF, PHILOSOPHY, INTUITION
Primary Focus: 12th house (unconscious, connection to higher power), Neptune (spirituality, dissolution), 9th house (philosophy, belief systems, higher meaning), Pisces (faith, transcendence)
What This Lens Answers:
                                                                                                                                                                                             * What’s my spiritual orientation?
                                                                                                                                                                                             * How do I connect with higher power?
                                                                                                                                                                                             * What do I believe and why?
                                                                                                                                                                                             * How does intuition function for me?
                                                                                                                                                                                             * What’s my philosophical framework?
Technical Process:
Direct Quote: “When you’re looking at the entire chart, also says, like, within the lens of spirituality, how does my mindset have to be? You know what? What would I think about? What would be the way that I kind of communicate spirituality? The fifth house would be like, what’s the point in the spirituality? Like, why, why would I be spiritual? What would I need to gain out of it?..The philosophy, the mindset, the mythology, the storytelling of spirituality would be all in the ninth house.”
Example from Instructor’s Chart:
Direct Quote: “With my North Node in the 12th house, it’s also saying that spirituality is going to be uncomfortable, which you’ve heard me say over and over and over…”
The Logic/Intuition Balance:
Direct Quote: “When it comes to your spirituality and your intuition, this is how you take action on your intuition and whether or not you trust your intuition to lead into the things that you do. When we just do things without any sort of intuition, we can get lost very easily because this is conflicting with this. However, that intuition needs to lead into what we choose to do, and that’s why the 12th leads into the first and semi-sextile.”
Lens #10: HOBBIES AND RECREATION
Primary Focus: 5th house (recreation, fun, creativity), Sun (vitality, what energizes you), 11th house (groups, variety)
What This Lens Answers:
                                                                                                                                                                                             * What hobbies fulfill me?
                                                                                                                                                                                             * How do I play and unwind?
                                                                                                                                                                                             * What brings me joy?
                                                                                                                                                                                             * What type of recreation recharges me?
Example from Instructor’s Chart:
Direct Quote: “For hobbies, when you’re looking at the hobbies, you know, you start with the fifth house because you want to understand recreation. You can start with the sun as well to see, you know, what type of energy that is…For me, having, you know, one to two friends around, you know, small groups, and being able to bring them in and, you know, play recreation. I love puzzle games, figuring things out, which is 11th house. I love word games, like, you know, word searches and crosswords…that’s all Gemini’s type of energy.”
Video Games (Technology + Media):
Direct Quote: “In the fifth house, would be the other side of it, video games, which would be technology and media…I’ll go buy it for myself. It’s that type of energy.”
Lens #11: LOVE AND RELATIONSHIPS
Primary Focus: 7th house (partnership, reciprocation), 5th house (vitality, purpose), 8th house (depth, intimacy, intensity), Venus (love, attraction)
What This Lens Answers:
                                                                                                                                                                                             * How do I love?
                                                                                                                                                                                             * What do I need in partnership?
                                                                                                                                                                                             * Where are my relationship patterns?
                                                                                                                                                                                             * What creates depth and intimacy for me?
The Multi-House Necessity:
Direct Quote: “So one of the things people get hung up on is they’ll say, oh, love and relationships. If I want to know about love, I go to Venus or I go to the seventh house…And it’s like, yes, for certain parts of it, but love is not just how you relate to another person; it’s not just the conversation you have…so much more that goes into it.”
The 5th House Purpose Component:
Direct Quote: “Being able to look at everything under a lens. So, like I said, when I talked about love, understanding that the fifth house has to do with vitality. Well, why are you in the relationship? A lot of people forget that. So, they get into the relationship. They have this reciprocating nature. But the fifth house element is gone, which is the purpose. Why do we get into this relationship? And when you forget that fifth house in the relationship, you don’t have a relationship anymore. You just have you with somebody else, and you’re just kind of coexisting.”
The 8th House Depth Component:
Direct Quote: “Then, the eighth house is that intensity; it’s that deep bond; it’s that intimacy. It’s getting deeper into whatever is going on with the sixth house, which stems off of the purpose of it. So one thing that is true of all lenses is that the eighth house is, you know, why would we get closer? What are we looking for? What’s deeper? Because the fifth house and the purpose is going to conflict with whether or not we can go deeper. So once we’ve assessed the purpose, then we have to say, well, how do we dive deeper? So we’re adding more to the purpose of this, and we’re, you know, bringing something closer together. Into a level of depth that we don’t want to get lost in, but we want to bring to again to the purpose so that the purpose enhances intimacy and any sort of bond that we have with whatever we’re doing.”
The Complete Relationship Picture:
                                                                                                                                                                                             * 7th House = How you relate, reciprocate, balance, partner
                                                                                                                                                                                             * 5th House = Why you’re in the relationship (purpose, vitality, fun)
                                                                                                                                                                                             * 8th House = How deep you go (intimacy, transformation, shared vulnerability)
                                                                                                                                                                                             * Venus = What you’re attracted to, how you love
                                                                                                                                                                                             * All must work together for a healthy relationship
Lens #12: COMMUNITY
Primary Focus: 11th house (groups, friendship networks, collective belonging), Aquarius/Uranus (innovation, equality, community values)
What This Lens Answers:
                                                                                                                                                                                             * What community do I need?
                                                                                                                                                                                             * How do I connect with groups?
                                                                                                                                                                                             * What’s my role in collective settings?
                                                                                                                                                                                             * Where do I find my tribe?
Lens Combination Example:
Direct Quote: “So if somebody is asking you, like, I want more community and, you know, I want to be in a community, you know, I want to do hobbies, but I want to find a community within the hobbies, well, where the hobby itself is the lens. Then we need to look in the 11th house, and we have to also look at what a community needs. So there’s two lenses: one is community and how you would assess with community, but then the second one is community within the lens of recreation. So you can dive deeper and deeper and deeper, depending on the question on lenses, to get the type of insight that is going to be beneficial for you or the person that’s asking.”
This demonstrates nested lenses—you can apply a lens WITHIN another lens for highly specific questions.

SECTION 4: COMPARING LENS PERSPECTIVES ON THE SAME CHART
The Power of Lens Switching
One of the most powerful demonstrations in this webinar is how the instructor repeatedly uses the same natal chart (their own) to show completely different stories emerging through different lenses.

SECTION 5: ADVANCED LENS TECHNIQUES
Nested Lenses (Lenses Within Lenses)
Direct Quote: “So if somebody is asking you, like, I want more community and, you know, I want to be in a community, you know, I want to do hobbies, but I want to find a community within the hobbies, well, where the hobby itself is the lens. Then we need to look in the 11th house, and we have to also look at what a community needs. So there’s two lenses: one is community and how you would assess with community, but then the second one is community within the lens of recreation.”

                                                                                                                                                                                             1. Start with the broader lens (e.g., Hobbies = 5th house)
                                                                                                                                                                                             2. Apply a secondary lens (e.g., Community = 11th house)
                                                                                                                                                                                             3. Look for overlap and interaction between the two themes
                                                                                                                                                                                             4. Synthesize: “Where do 5th house themes meet 11th house themes?”

                                                                                                                                                                                             * “What community (11th) supports my spirituality (12th)?” → Community lens within Spirituality lens
                                                                                                                                                                                             * “How does my home (4th) affect my mental health (6th)?” → Home lens within Mental Health lens
Component Lenses (Zooming Into Details)
The windows example demonstrates component lenses:
Direct Quote: “You start breaking down the different components of the house, and you start thinking, what are windows? What energy represents windows?..Windows are represented by Pisces energy for those exact reasons.”
How to Create Component Lenses:
                                                                                                                                                                                             1. Identify the larger lens (e.g., Home)
                                                                                                                                                                                             2. Break it into physical or conceptual components (rooms, windows, doors, foundation, etc.)
                                                                                                                                                                                             3. Assign archetypal energy to each component based on symbolic meaning
                                                                                                                                                                                             4. Track those specific placements in the chart
Examples of Components:
                                                                                                                                                                                             * Home: Windows (Pisces/Neptune/12th), Doors (Aries/Mars/1st), Kitchen (Cancer/Moon/4th), Basement (Scorpio/Pluto/8th)
                                                                                                                                                                                             * Body: Head (Aries/1st), Digestive system (Virgo/6th), Knees (Capricorn/10th), Nervous system (Gemini/3rd)
                                                                                                                                                                                             * Career: Daily tasks (6th), Long-term goals (10th), Coworkers (3rd), Authority (Saturn/10th)
The Natural Rulership Warning
Direct Quote: “Don’t get hung up on the natural rulership, I’m going to have to go back to natural rulership, some people are getting hung up onto it. Natural rulership contributes to related energies, not to energy flow. So when you’re seeing like the natural of the first house is Aries, you’re not going to Mars to complete this. Where Leo is, you’re using Mars as an ad side, the plus sign…while that’s happening, I’m also, I take action in this way at the same time. So it’s a combination…don’t get stuck on ‘natural ruler’ for the flow of meaning.”
What This Means:
                                                                                                                                                                                             * Natural rulership (Aries = 1st house, Taurus = 2nd house, etc.) provides background themes
                                                                                                                                                                                             * But energy flow comes from the actual chart placements
                                                                                                                                                                                             * Example: Leo rising person doesn’t follow Mars for 1st house energy—they follow Sun’s placement
                                                                                                                                                                                             * Mars adds flavor (the “plus sign”), but Sun shows the actual flow
Critical for App Implementation:
 The app must distinguish between:
                                                                                                                                                                                             * Chart-specific rulers (primary for energy flow)
                                                                                                                                                                                             * Natural rulers (secondary for thematic context)
Fusion Cusps and Zero-Degree Placements
Student Question: “Do you merge ascendant with the 12th ascendant at zero degrees with the Twelfth House, same at 29 with the…?”
Direct Quote: “You don’t merge them. So you’re talking about a, you’re talking about ascendant that’s sitting at zero degrees, it’s still at zero degrees. But when it’s in the fusion cusp area…I’m gonna use my zero, for instance; it’s definitively a Fourth House placement. It’s definitively a Scorpio placement in the Pluto deck. And however, when I read it together, its influence is pushing Fourth House energy into the Third House…But you’re always taking that energy and you’re merging it in with this, and this becomes a secondary ruler. So that energy is fused in with the Third House, but it stems from the Fourth House.”
Fusion Cusp Rule:
                                                                                                                                                                                             * Placement is factually in one house
                                                                                                                                                                                             * But influences the adjacent house when within ~5 degrees of cusp
                                                                                                                                                                                             * Read the primary house first
                                                                                                                                                                                             * Then add the influence/fusion of the adjacent house as secondary layer
                                                                                                                                                                                             * Both are active, but one is primary

Lenses + Delegates (Transcript 13)
Direct Quote: “A lot of the things you’ve learned recently, like PHSR, Planet House sign ruler, and then cycling it back, that’s obviously been something that, you know, we want to focus on as well.”
How They Work Together:
                                                                                                                                                                                             * Delegates show WHERE house themes are expressed
                                                                                                                                                                                             * Lenses show WHY you’re looking at those houses
                                                                                                                                                                                             * Example: Money lens (2nd house) + delegates show where 2nd house themes flow through the chart
Process:
                                                                                                                                                                                             1. Apply lens (e.g., Career lens)
                                                                                                                                                                                             2. Identify primary houses (6th, 10th)
                                                                                                                                                                                             3. Find delegates for those houses
                                                                                                                                                                                             4. Trace delegate networks through the chart
                                                                                                                                                                                             5. Interpret career themes through delegate locations
Lenses + Aspect Spectrum (Transcript 10)
Direct Quote: “And the grand trine, I didn’t talk about the grand trines before, but the grand trine from there is gonna lead into your mental health. Your mental health is gonna lead into your sense of stability and your long-term goals and sense of achievement and what you’ve done over time, which should lead directly back in.”
How They Work Together:
                                                                                                                                                                                             * Lenses identify which aspects matter for the question

                                                                                                                                                                                             * Self-worth (2nd) → Mental health (6th) → Achievement (10th) → back to self-worth
Lenses + Progressions + Relocations
Direct Quote: “You always read the natal chart first; that is your baseline energies. And then, to understand the phases of life, you will go into the progressions. And then, if you’ve moved, you’re gonna add the relocations. I would, the order I would do it would actually be natal chart relocations. I would read those two together, and then I would go into the progressions to see where you are in life. Because if your energy is completely different, we have to add that in there.”
The Layered Reading Process:
Layer 1: Natal Chart Through Lens
                                                                                                                                                                                             * “What does my natal chart say about career?”

Layer 2: Relocation Chart Through Same Lens
                                                                                                                                                                                             * “How does living in this city affect my career?”
                                                                                                                                                                                             * House cusps shift, changing which houses are emphasized
Layer 3: Progressions Through Same Lens
                                                                                                                                                                                             * “Where am I in my career evolution right now?”
                                                                                                                                                                                             * Shows current phase, what’s being activated
All Three Combined:

SECTION 7: EXTENSIVE Q&A - STUDENT QUESTIONS
Q1: Order of Reading - Natal, Relocation, Progression
Student Question: “Would you read the lenses first with natal relocated progress chart?”
Direct Quote: “You always read the natal chart first; that is your baseline energies. And then, to understand the phases of life, you will go into the progressions. And then, if you’ve moved, you’re gonna add the relocations. I would, the order I would do it would actually be natal chart relocations. I would read those two together, and then I would go into the progressions to see where you are in life. Because if your energy is completely different, we have to add that in there.”
The Proper Order:
                                                                                                                                                                                             1. Natal chart (baseline)
                                                                                                                                                                                             2. Relocation chart (if person moved)
                                                                                                                                                                                             3. Read natal + relocation together
                                                                                                                                                                                             4. Then add progressions (current phase)
Q2: Career Lens vs. Business Lens - What’s the Difference?
Student Question: “Is there a difference between a career lens and building a business like the reading did for me based on my natal?”
Direct Quote: “Yes, because your overall focus is, whether or not, I mean, they’re subtly different. Whether you’re working for yourself or you’re working for somebody else is gonna be very important.”
Key Distinctions:
Career/Work Lens (Employee):
                                                                                                                                                                                             * 6th house = your daily work, service, routine
                                                                                                                                                                                             * 3rd house = coworkers
                                                                                                                                                                                             * 10th house = your boss, authority over you
                                                                                                                                                                                             * You serve someone else’s vision
Business/Entrepreneurship Lens (Self-Employed):
                                                                                                                                                                                             * 6th house = your employees (if you have them)
                                                                                                                                                                                             * 3rd house = communication, not coworkers
                                                                                                                                                                                             * 10th house = your authority, your structure, your management
                                                                                                                                                                                             * 7th house = business partners, contracts
                                                                                                                                                                                             * You create the vision
Direct Quote: “When you are running your own business, the Sixth House becomes your employees. Do you have employees? How does that work? Does it work?”
Direct Quote: “In the Seventh House…how your relationship is with your own business. That’s added now in the Seventh House when you’re talking about your own business.”
Q3: Fusion Cusps and Zero-Degree Placements
Student Question: “Do you merge ascendant with the 12th ascendant at zero degrees with the Twelfth House, same at 29 with the…?”
Direct Quote: “You don’t merge them…when it’s in the fusion cusp area…I’m gonna use my zero, for instance; it’s definitively a Fourth House placement. It’s definitively a Scorpio placement in the Pluto deck. And however, when I read it together, its influence is pushing Fourth House energy into the Third House.”
The Answer:
                                                                                                                                                                                             * Factually in one house (primary)
                                                                                                                                                                                             * But influences adjacent house (secondary)
                                                                                                                                                                                             * Read primary house first
                                                                                                                                                                                             * Add fusion influence from adjacent house
                                                                                                                                                                                             * Both matter, but hierarchy exists
Q4: Saturn in 9th House and Anxiety
Student Question: “Saturn was in the ninth and Aries, how would anxiety present?”
Direct Quote: “So it would, it would not present. So, okay, so basically you’re saying if Saturn was up here, so basically, um, it’s not as much about stress in that case, as much as it is about overwhelm, and then that overwhelm leads into stress…this would be a much more outward level where I would over-exaggerate…taking on too much responsibility, feeling like I could do everything and, um, trying to be a perfectionist in every single thing I’m doing while also trying to do everything without allowing myself to get anything really done, especially since my Saturn’s in retrograde. And then that would contribute to probably more stress than I have now.”
The Distinction:

                                                                                                                                                                                             * Saturn in 9th = overwhelm → then stress
                                                                                                                                                                                             * Different pathway, different manifestation
Q5: 12th House Placements and Unconscious Awareness
Student Question: “If you have a lot of 12th house placements, can that mean that you have an awareness of the unconscious?”
Direct Quote: “You could have an awareness of the unconscious. Your energy is definitely directed into that realm, of the unconscious of the higher power, so to speak; you’re, you’re more in tune usually…but usually you’re more in tune with the fact that there is a higher power, um, and tied into that energy. And it becomes a lot of what dictates the things that happen in your life. And they all lead kind of into, well, it’s all leads into hope. This all leads into creativity or inspiration, all leads into things that are behind the scenes and unknown…but it is also, um, with a higher power. Yes, and more of an awareness of it.”
The Answer: Yes, but the type of awareness depends on specific placements and aspects within the 12th house.
Q6: Energy Cleaning and Spirituality
Student Question: “Energy cleaning, energy is Aquarian energy?”
Direct Quote: “So depending on how Aquarius, the 11th house ruler, Uranus, um, and whatever’s in the 11th house, however, that sits there is going to tell you what, you know, if energy is a big part of it…energy is Aquarian energy. And then spirituality is your 12th house ruler, or Neptune, or the 12th house itself—all that Pisces energy.”
The Distinction:
                                                                                                                                                                                             * Energy work, energy awareness = 11th house/Aquarius/Uranus
                                                                                                                                                                                             * Spirituality, faith, connection to higher power = 12th house/Neptune/Pisces
Q7: Complex Water House Configuration
Student Question: “Because you have, I’m sorry, cancer in twelve, and you said before about the triangle. And what if it was Scorpio in twelve? Pisces in fourth. And can cancer in eighth house…”
Direct Quote: “So, yeah, you’re on. You have your unconscious plays out through intensity. OK, and through traumas…Now you have Pisces down here. Yes, yeah, Pisces. Yeah, so your emotional comfort, your emotional stability is within the unknown, is within the ability to go with the flow. There is a natural ebb and flow that you you emotionally have to kind of ride like this. And that it’s anything that has to do with your safety and security is within a greater power. You know, knowing that you’re going to feel safe, and then your eighth house is going to be in cancer. So your traumas are usually related to emotional wounds or the mother or the family, especially on the feminine side as well. And then your emotion, your trauma is also processed and held within your emotions and how you emotionally react to things. It’s also your level of intensity contributes to how you emotionally respond to things.”
This demonstrates:
                                                                                                                                                                                             * How to read interlocking house themes
                                                                                                                                                                                             * Water houses (4th, 8th, 12th) in water signs create emotional intensification
                                                                                                                                                                                             * Each house contributes its specific flavor to the overall emotional/intuitive landscape
Q8: Natural Rulership Confusion
Student Question (implied from instructor’s response): Confusion about whether to use natural rulers (Aries = 1st, Taurus = 2nd, etc.) or chart-specific rulers.
Direct Quote: “Don’t get hung up on the natural rulership, I’m going to have to go back to natural rulership, some people are getting hung up onto it. Natural rulership contributes to related energies, not to energy flow. So when you’re seeing like the natural of the first house is Aries, you’re not going to Mars to complete this. Where Leo is, you’re using Mars as an ad side, the plus sign.”
The Rule:
                                                                                                                                                                                             * Chart-specific rulers = energy flow (primary)
                                                                                                                                                                                             * Natural rulers = thematic context (secondary, “ad side”)
                                                                                                                                                                                             * Don’t trace natural rulers for delegate chains
                                                                                                                                                                                             * Use them to add flavor/theme, not structure
Q9: Age and Physical Limitations in Fitness
Student Question (paraphrased): “What about knees at my age?”
Direct Quote: “First thing I would tell you is, you said knees at my age, I would knock that off…age is just a marker…(motivational anecdote about 88-year-old martial arts master)…we have to have that resilience and that safe house energy as well.”
The Guidance:
                                                                                                                                                                                             * Age beliefs create limitations
                                                                                                                                                                                             * Chart shows capacity, not age restrictions
                                                                                                                                                                                             * Work with chart indicators, not cultural age expectations

SECTION 8: COMMON MISTAKES AND CORRECTIONS
Mistake #1: Relying Only on One House/Planet Per Theme
Direct Quote: “So one of the things people get hung up on is they’ll say, oh, love and relationships. If I want to know about love, I go to Venus or I go to the seventh house…And it’s like, yes, for certain parts of it, but love is not just how you relate to another person…there’s so much more that goes into it.”
The Problem: Oversimplification leads to incomplete, generic readings.
The Solution: Use multiple houses, planets, and relationships for any theme. Love requires 5th (purpose), 7th (relating), 8th (depth), Venus (attraction).
Mistake #2: Treating Archetypes as Literal Definitions
Direct Quote: “In astrology, we tend to forget when we give the names of archetypes to planets and houses specifically, we start forgetting that everything has to work together…we’re not dealing with definitions and we’re not dealing with placements; those are building blocks for a bigger picture.”
The Problem: Keywords become rigid boxes that limit interpretation.
The Solution: Treat archetypes as flexible symbolic languages that blend and interact.
Mistake #3: Ignoring Natural Rulership vs. Chart-Specific Rulership
Direct Quote: “Don’t get hung up on the natural rulership…Natural rulership contributes to related energies, not to energy flow.”
The Problem: Tracing natural rulers instead of chart-specific rulers.
The Solution: Use chart placements for energy flow; natural rulers add thematic context only.
Mistake #4: Confirmation Bias When Reading Your Own Chart
Direct Quote: “When you guys get into reading your own charts, you want to do that as well. You wanna do your best to be like, I’m gonna pretend that this is not me because it can be very easy for you to get hung up on making it make sense and, you know, basically confirmation bias as opposed to actually reading the chart.”
The Problem: Forcing the chart to match what you already believe about yourself.
The Solution: Read your own chart as if it belongs to a stranger; let insights emerge objectively.
Mistake #5: Misassigning Mental Health to 12th House
Direct Quote: “Mental health is one that you’re gonna get a lot of. First place you always look for mental health is where? A lot of people think it’s the 12th house in Neptune; it is not…Sixth, yes. The sixth house is where you’re gonna look.”
The Problem: Cultural assumption that mental health = unconscious (12th).
The Solution:
                                                                                                                                                                                             * 6th house = mental health, mind-body connection (primary)
                                                                                                                                                                                             * 12th house = escapism, spirituality, unconscious (secondary, for spiritual mental health only)
Mistake #6: Not Checking Degrees and Order
Implied throughout: Order of planets by degree matters for activation sequence, but this is often forgotten when applying lenses.
The Solution: Always note degree order of planets in houses, especially when multiple planets are present.
Mistake #7: Applying Wrong Lens for the Question
Direct Quote: “Each question is going to lead you to how you’re reading the lenses.”
The Problem: Using a generic “tell me about my chart” approach rather than question-specific lens.
The Solution: Always clarify the question first, then select the appropriate lens (or multiple lenses).

SECTION 9: MASTERY GUIDANCE - BECOMING PROFICIENT WITH LENSES
How Long Does It Take to Learn?
No specific timeframe is given, but the instructor emphasizes:
Direct Quote: “What seems to be easy for me, it’s not always some people’s energies, some energies of the transits, even when I do those reports, they’re more difficult to to decipher.”
Implication: Mastery is individual and requires consistent practice. Some charts/questions are easier than others.
Recommended Practice Exercises
1. Single Chart, Multiple Lenses:
 Take your own chart and read it through:
                                                                                                                                                                                             * Home lens
                                                                                                                                                                                             * Career lens
                                                                                                                                                                                             * Money lens
                                                                                                                                                                                             * Mental health lens
                                                                                                                                                                                             * Fitness lens
                                                                                                                                                                                             * Self-love lens
Notice how different insights emerge each time.
2. Objective Self-Reading:
Direct Quote: “When you guys get into reading your own charts, you want to do that as well. You wanna do your best to be like, I’m gonna pretend that this is not me because it can be very easy for you to get hung up on making it make sense and, you know, basically confirmation bias as opposed to actually reading the chart. So we wanna make sure that that’s what you’re doing, that you are pulling that energy in as though you’re giving somebody else advice and that’ll be super helpful for you.”
Practice reading your chart as if it’s a stranger’s.
3. PHSR (Planet House Sign Ruler) Cycling:
Direct Quote: “A lot of the things you’ve learned recently, like PHSR, Planet House sign ruler, and then cycling it back, that’s obviously been something that, you know, we want to focus on as well.”
For any lens:
                                                                                                                                                                                             * Identify relevant planet

4. Question-Driven Practice:
Direct Quote: “Each question is going to lead you to how you’re reading the lenses.”

SECTION 11: PHILOSOPHICAL IMPLICATIONS & EVOLUTION OF INTERPRETATION
The Paradigm Shift
Direct Quote: “In astrology, we tend to forget when we give the names of archetypes to planets and houses specifically, we start forgetting that everything has to work together. One of the key components of alchemistic astrology is the understanding that we’re not dealing with definitions and we’re not dealing with placements; those are building blocks for a bigger picture.”
What Lenses Represent:
Lenses are not just a technique—they represent a fundamental philosophical shift in how astrology is practiced:
Old Paradigm:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                * Chart as fixed meanings
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                * Placements as definitions
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                * One-size-fits-all interpretation
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                * “Your Venus means X, your Mars means Y”
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                * Static, cookbook astrology
New Paradigm (Lenses):
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                * Chart as dynamic system
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                * Placements as relationships
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                * Question-driven interpretation
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                * “Let’s look at your chart through the money lens to answer your financial question”
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                * Fluid, contextual astrology
From Reductionism to Holism
Direct Quote: “We’re looking at everything, the entire chart, and more importantly, the relationship of energies to each other that create color theory. It creates the unique blend and mixture of energies that create or comprise you, a situation, an event, whatever you’re looking at.”
Color Theory as Metaphor:
Just as:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                * Red + Blue = Purple
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                * But Red + Yellow = Orange
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                * And Blue + Yellow = Green
In astrology:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                * Same planet (red) + different house (blue vs. yellow) = completely different meaning
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                * Same house (blue) + different ruling planet (red vs. yellow) = completely different experience
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                * Context determines meaning, not isolated placements
The Question-Driven Revolution
Direct Quote: “Each question is going to lead you to how you’re reading the lenses. So if somebody is asking you, like, I want more community and, you know, I want to be in a community, you know, I want to do hobbies, but I want to find a community within the hobbies, well, where the hobby itself is the lens.”
What This Changes:
Traditional Approach:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                * Client: “Tell me about my chart.”
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                * Astrologer: Describes every house, every planet, overwhelming information dump.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                * Client leaves confused, with no actionable guidance.
Lens Approach:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                * Client: “I want to find community within my hobbies.”
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                * Astrologer: “Let me apply the hobbies lens AND the community lens.”
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                * Astrologer provides specific guidance on WHERE and HOW to find this.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                * Client leaves with clear action steps.
This transforms astrology from description to prescription.

SECTION 12: SUMMARY & KEY TAKEAWAYS
Core Concepts to Master
1. Lenses Are Perspective-Shifting Tools
Direct Quote: “Basically, what we’re doing is looking at an astrology chart, a natal chart, an electional chart, a business chart, a transit report, anything like that, and we’re trying to understand what is it we’re actually looking at.”
Lenses allow you to view the same chart from multiple angles, extracting different insights each time.
2. No Single House/Planet Represents a Life Theme
Direct Quote: “Love is not just how you relate to another person; it’s not just the conversation you have…so much more that goes into it, and understanding the myriad of things that you can extract from the thematic expressions of each planet, each energy—which includes the signs and the houses—is going to help you understand what component that is.”
Every life area involves multiple houses, planets, and their interactions.
3. Question-Driven Interpretation is Essential
Direct Quote: “Each question is going to lead you to how you’re reading the lenses.”
Always clarify the question BEFORE selecting which lens to apply.
4. Chart-Specific Rulers vs. Natural Rulers
Direct Quote: “Natural rulership contributes to related energies, not to energy flow.”
Follow chart-specific rulers for structure; use natural rulers for thematic context only.
5. Lenses Can Be Nested and Layered
Direct Quote: “There’s two lenses: one is community and how you would assess with community, but then the second one is community within the lens of recreation. So you can dive deeper and deeper and deeper, depending on the question on lenses.”
Complex questions require multiple lenses applied simultaneously.
6. Same Chart, Infinite Perspectives
The instructor’s chart revealed entirely different stories through:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                * Home lens: childhood trauma, window incidents
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                * Career lens: technology sales, team dynamics
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                * Money lens: dual income streams, creative monetization
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                * Mental health lens: stress tolerance patterns
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                * Fitness lens: workout variety needs
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                * Nutrition lens: snacking patterns
This is the power of lenses—infinite insights from one chart.
Most Important Quotes
On the Purpose of Lenses:
Direct Quote: “We’re looking at everything, the entire chart, and more importantly, the relationship of energies to each other that create color theory. It creates the unique blend and mixture of energies that create or comprise you, a situation, an event, whatever you’re looking at.”
On Avoiding Reductionism:
Direct Quote: “In astrology, we tend to forget when we give the names of archetypes to planets and houses specifically, we start forgetting that everything has to work together…we’re not dealing with definitions and we’re not dealing with placements; those are building blocks for a bigger picture.”
On Question-Driven Interpretation:
Direct Quote: “Each question is going to lead you to how you’re reading the lenses. So if somebody is asking you, like, I want more community and, you know, I want to be in a community, you know, I want to do hobbies, but I want to find a community within the hobbies, well, where the hobby itself is the lens.”
On Objectivity:
Direct Quote: “When you guys get into reading your own charts, you want to do that as well. You wanna do your best to be like, I’m gonna pretend that this is not me because it can be very easy for you to get hung up on making it make sense and, you know, basically confirmation bias as opposed to actually reading the chart.”
On Natural vs. Chart-Specific Rulership:
Direct Quote: “Don’t get hung up on the natural rulership…Natural rulership contributes to related energies, not to energy flow.”

What Makes Lenses Revolutionary
Before Lenses:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Astrology felt overwhelming (so many placements to consider!)
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Readings were generic (Venus means love, Mars means action)
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Charts seemed like random collections of symbols
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Clients left sessions confused and uncertain
After Lenses:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Astrology becomes focused (apply relevant lens to the question)
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Readings are specific (YOUR Venus in YOUR 12th house means…)
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Charts reveal organized, logical systems
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Clients leave with clear, actionable guidance
Direct Quote: “Being able to look at everything under a lens…you can dive deeper and deeper and deeper, depending on the question on lenses, to get the type of insight that is going to be beneficial for you or the person that’s asking.”
Final Instructor Guidance
On Continued Learning:
Direct Quote: “This is just one webinar. We’ll dive more into this if anybody either wants to put up a post or if we want to do another webinar specific to like we just want to talk about the lenses of entrepreneurship or we just want to talk the lenses of self-love and whatever and dive deeper.”
On Practice:
Direct Quote: “I want you guys to be able to do, you know, for yourselves. What seems to be easy for me, it’s not always some people’s energies, some energies of the transits, even when I do those reports, they’re more difficult to to decipher. But, you know, a lot of the things you’ve learned recently, like PHSR, Planet House sign ruler, and then cycling it back, that’s obviously been something that, you know, we want to focus on as well.”


📘 TRANSCRIPT 11: DEBUNKING TOP 10 POP ASTROLOGY MYTHS
Complete Knowledge Extraction for App Development
________________


OVERVIEW
This transcript represents a critical validation and clarification session that systematically dismantles the most pervasive myths in pop culture astrology and replaces them with accurate Alchemistic Astrology principles. This isn’t just correction—it’s reconstruction of fundamental astrological understanding.
The Central Problem: Pop culture astrology has created a simplified, monetized version of astrology that is “watered-down, diluted, and always wrong.” These myths prevent genuine understanding, alignment, and practical application of astrological wisdom.
The Solution: Replace each myth with the correct technical understanding, grounded in energy flow, foundational relationships, and the dynamic, relational nature of chart interpretation.
Key Learning Objectives:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Identify the 10 most damaging myths in pop astrology
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Understand WHY each myth is wrong (not just that it’s wrong)
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Master the CORRECT interpretation for each concept
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Learn to recognize pop astrology red flags in the wild
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Develop critical thinking skills to evaluate astrological claims
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Integrate corrections with all previously learned Alchemistic concepts
Why This Matters:
Direct Quote: “The reason why this is so important is because if you believe any of those things that pop culture astrology tells you, and those astrologers constantly push out, you’re never going to understand what they really mean because you’re believing the definition of something that’s inaccurate. Therefore, you can’t align with it. You can’t alchemize it. You can’t use it.”

SECTION 1: THE POP ASTROLOGY PROBLEM
What IS Pop Culture Astrology?
Direct Quote: “Pop culture astrology, for those of you who don’t really know what we mean by that, pop culture astrology is like the stereotypes and the generalized things that you hear all the time that are just flat-out wrong. Unfortunately, it creates a situation where you hear these things, and even if you feel like they don’t apply to you, or they’re not really true to you, you hear everybody talk about them. Because it’s basically simple or simplified, watered-down, diluted astrology, and every time somebody tries to use that, it’s always wrong.”
Characteristics of Pop Astrology:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Oversimplified - Complex concepts reduced to soundbites
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Stereotyped - Universal claims applied to everyone (“all Cancers are emotional”)
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Sun-sign focused - Everything based on birthday/sun sign alone
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Monetized - Created “because it makes them money”
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Static - Ignores dynamic relationships, energy flow, context
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Wrong - “Every time somebody tries to use that, it’s always wrong”
The Linda Goodman Legacy
Direct Quote: “Linda Goodman, I think that’s her name, back a while ago now, she was one of the people responsible for bringing astrology to the mainstream. But unfortunately, when she did that, she basically created, not single-handedly, but basically created pop culture astrology, where she based everything on your birthday, on your sun sign, and whatnot. And when you get into real astrology, you realize that your sun is just one component. Is it important? Absolutely. … But … every time somebody tries to use that, it’s always wrong.”
The Historical Context:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Linda Goodman popularized astrology for mass audiences
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Made astrology accessible and profitable
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * But in doing so, oversimplified to the point of inaccuracy
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Created the “sun sign astrology” phenomenon
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Set the template for decades of pop astrology books, apps, and content
The Cost:
 Mainstream acceptance came at the expense of accuracy, depth, and practical utility.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Creates a low barrier to entry for “astrologers”
Social Reinforcement:

The Stakes: What’s at Risk
Direct Quote: “So the reason why this is so important is because if you believe any of those things that pop culture astrology tells you, and those astrologers constantly push out, you’re never going to understand what they really mean because you’re believing the definition of something that’s inaccurate. Therefore, you can’t align with it. You can’t alchemize it. You can’t use it.”
What Gets Lost:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      1. Genuine Self-Understanding - False definitions prevent real insight
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      2. Practical Application - Can’t use astrology effectively if foundations are wrong
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      3. Alignment - Can’t align with your true nature if you’re working from myths
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      4. Alchemization - Can’t transform your life using incorrect tools
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      5. Empowerment - Myths keep you passive; truth enables agency
The Instructor’s Mission:
Direct Quote: “Pop culture astrology is so easily debunked, but the point isn’t just to debunk it in terms of saying, oh, that’s not it. The whole point is always to say, well, what is, which is what we’re doing here.”
This isn’t just criticism—it’s replacement. Every myth is corrected with the accurate understanding.

SECTION 2: THE ALCHEMISTIC DISTINCTION
What Makes Alchemistic Astrology Different
Direct Quote: “When you get into real astrology, you realize that your sun is just one component…We’re not supposed to traverse and go float around in the ether, just as a spiritual presence; that’s probably what happens between life. I don’t know…But when people ask me about resources or books, there’s nothing because I developed a system. I developed one that is reliable and accurate.”
Core Philosophical Differences:
1. Holism vs. Reductionism

Direct Quote: “Not only do we understand the real definitions of these energies and the archetypes and how energy actually relates, but we understand that it can be alchemized; it can be used. Because if you wait for the planets to go around, you’ll be 40 years from now still waiting, because the planets are never 100% favorable for anything. … That’s what alchemistic is about.”
The Four Pillars of Alchemistic Astrology
Direct Quote: “I have like four or five main principles in alchemistic astrology. This one and the foundational relationship of energies, color theory, and block theory. Those four pillars of alchemistic astrology are literally the separating and defining things that make this system work and other systems not.”
Pillar 1: Energy Flow
Direct Quote: “If you don’t know that this energy came first and this one came second, you’re not going to understand all of it…There’s a difference between the sun influencing the north node in terms of its energy being, working with the lunar energy here versus this being derived off of it.”
The order and sequence of energies matter profoundly.
Pillar 2: Foundational Relationship of Energies (FREE)
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * How signs, houses, and planets relate to each other
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Natural correspondences (Aries = 1st house = Mars)
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Dynamic interactions (squares, trines, oppositions)
Pillar 3: Color Theory
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Energies blend like colors

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * No single placement exists in isolation
Pillar 4: Block Theory
Direct Quote: “Block theory in alchemistic astrology actually came from my childhood of playing with Legos.”
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Chart components are building blocks
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Each block contributes to the whole structure
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Remove or misunderstand one block, structure weakens
The Evolutionary Nature of the System
Direct Quote: “And what’s different about alchemistic astrology? I mean, it’s everything. The philosophy, the way energy flow works, everything. But is when we have alchemistic astrologers…they are understanding how it works to the point where they’re like, oh, I get that. What about this? And they’re developing their own theories, whether they realize they’re doing it or not, they’re doing it because they’re like, oh, I see some truth. Let’s add truth, let’s add truth. And when they do readings for other people, the people they do those readings for are like, oh my God, that was really accurate.”

SECTION 3: THE 10 MYTHS - COMPLETE BREAKDOWN
MYTH #1: “The Ascendant is the mask you wear”
The Myth Statement:
Direct Quote: “A lot of times, you’ll hear the ascendant is the mask you wear; that’s pretty common. That’s even in astrology books. It is not.”
Why It’s Wrong:
Direct Quote: “So when they say that the ascendant is not you, and it’s the mask you wear, it makes absolutely no sense because if it was the mask we wear, there would be some sort of hidden element to it. There would be some sort of secrecy, and there would be some sort of trickery in there, but Aries energy acts way too fast to be fake. It is our first natural reaction; when it’s in its highest vibration, it is our response. But it is always us; it is always how we do it.”
The Logical Breakdown:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * A “mask” implies concealment, something fake or put on
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * The Ascendant/1st house corresponds to Aries energy
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Aries is the fastest, most impulsive energy in the zodiac
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * You cannot fake what happens instantly
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * The Ascendant is your immediate, authentic reaction
The Truth:
Direct Quote: “The ascendant is not your mask you wear; the ascendant is your motivations. Remember, the ascendant is bringing in the sun to reality as it aligns with your sense of self and who you are. You’re bringing purpose to your actions. What do we call that? Purpose to actions, motivations. This is your reason; this is your passion.”
The Ascendant IS:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * First reactions and immediate responses
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * How purpose (Sun) becomes action (physical reality)
Direct Quote: “It is not the mask. It really is you. It’s just what we do in the physical form.”
Nuances:
Direct Quote: “On the baseline, the ascendant is not your mask; it is your motivations.”
Complex aspects might make someone “more secretive,” but that’s a function of aspects, not the Ascendant itself.
Practical Implications:
If you believe the mask myth:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * You’ll dismiss clients’ Ascendant as “not the real them”
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * You’ll miss understanding their core motivations
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * You’ll misinterpret immediate reactions as “false fronts”
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * You’ll overlook the physical body connection
Corrective Guidance:
Always treat the Ascendant as:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      1. The authentic, immediate self
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      2. Physical presence and body
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      3. Motivational force driving actions
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      4. The mechanism by which Sun’s purpose becomes real
Integration:
The Ascendant is the first Vitality Anchor, working with the Midheaven (second Vitality Anchor) to structure how life purpose manifests.

MYTH #2: “The 8th house shows how you’re going to die”
The Myth Statement:
Direct Quote: “The second one is the eighth house, which shows you how you’re going to die, or how I said you’ll exit this life. Again, it doesn’t.”
Why It’s Wrong:
Direct Quote: “The idea that the eighth house is how you’re going to die is absolutely ridiculous.”
The Evidence - Real Charts:
Example 1: Instructor’s Wife’s Sister
Direct Quote: “We have my wife’s sister, and she gave me permission to be able to talk about this. So we have, these are the energies here. Now, what we wanted to look at is the idea in pop culture; astrology is that the eighth house shows us how we’re going to die. So, we go to her eighth house; she did die, she passed away.”
8th House Configuration:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Chiron in 8th house at 18 degrees
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Pop astrology would say: “Chiron = wound, 8th = death, therefore wounded death”
Actual Cause of Death:
 Direct Quote: “She died of an accidental drug overdose. That’s how she died, and she died at home.”
The 8th house revealed NOTHING about:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Manner of death (overdose)
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Location of death (home)
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Circumstances (accidental)
Direct Quote: “And as you can see, nothing happened in her eighth house, nothing because all death is based off of transits.”
Example 2: Robin Williams
Direct Quote: “So the question is, does the eighth house show how they died? So we know how Robin Williams passed. Most of us know that it was hanging and that this one was something specific. So Chiron here, and I haven’t even looked at Robin Williams in a long time, but his natal chart has nothing in the eighth house. So you would not be able to say, oh, the eighth house, that’s how you’re gonna go even if you look to the ruler.”
Robin Williams’ Chart:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * NOTHING in 8th house
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Yet he died by hanging
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * The 8th house was empty, provided no information
The Truth:
Direct Quote: “All death is based off of transits…death is not going to show in your natal chart; it is going to show in transits and transits to other people’s charts.”
Why This Makes Sense:
Direct Quote: “Because at that point, if it was sitting directly in your natal chart, how would you know when it was going to happen?”
Natal charts are STATIC - they show potential, not timing.
Transits are DYNAMIC - they show when events occur.
Who’s Chart Shows Death?
Direct Quote: “And in fact, if you pull up Ashley’s chart, let’s make sure that is the same day…Venus is going over Juno retrograde. This actually had to do with Ashley’s situation. I’m not going to get too deep into this, but Ashley not really connecting with her sister during this time.”
Death shows up in:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Transit charts (timing)
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Other people’s charts (family members, close relationships)
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Progressions (internal development)
Why: Because Pluto (death/transformation) and Neptune (dissolution) are other people’s energy, not self-energy.
Pisces/Neptune vs. Scorpio/Pluto:
Direct Quote: “Mercury rules siblings; yes, the eighth house is involved, but more than the eighth house is Pisces energy. Pisces rules anything that has to do with pharmaceuticals, has to do with isolation, depression, and also has to do more so with death than Pluto. Neptune is the end of cycles, end of life, and you can’t…you can’t get it back. When Neptune comes around and it’s dissolved and it’s gone, it’s gone. Pluto is a rebirth, and yes, death can happen because you can go too deep into things.”
Key Distinction:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Pluto/Scorpio = transformation, rebirth (death AND resurrection)
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Neptune/Pisces = dissolution, endings (death as FINALITY)
The sister’s overdose involved:

Practical Implications:
Believing this myth:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Creates fear and fatalism
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Leads to false predictions that scare clients
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Wastes interpretive focus on the wrong areas
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Can cause emotional harm

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      2. Look at transits (especially Neptune)
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      3. Check charts of close family/friends
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      4. Understand 8th house is about transformation, intimacy, shared resources—not literal death
Integration:
This reinforces that Alchemistic Astrology is dynamic, not static. Natal charts are blueprints; transits are when blueprints activate.

MYTH #3: “The Midheaven (MC) is your career”
The Myth Statement:
Direct Quote: “The third one is the midheaven is not your career, a huge one. Almost every astrology book, every astrology video, every website always tries to take the midheaven and correlate it to your career, and sometimes there is a correlation. But I’ll explain to you why it is not your career, not only directly, but even indirectly.”
Why It’s Wrong:
The MC Can Be in Different Houses:
Direct Quote: “But you can have a midheaven in the 8th house, 9th house, 10th house, 11th house, 12th house. It can be in any of those houses.”
The MC is a calculated point (where the meridian crosses the ecliptic), not a house. It floats and can land in:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * 8th house
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * 9th house
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * 10th house (only sometimes!)
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * 11th house
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * 12th house
If MC = career, then how can it be in the 12th house (isolation, spirituality) and still mean “career”? It doesn’t make sense.
What the 10th House Actually Means:
Direct Quote: “So when you’re talking about the midheaven, so these are all the, I’m going to erase this, but these are all the tenth house themes here. They’re all Capricorn, they’re all Saturn. When you realize that the sign is the house, is the planet, and that natural rulership usurps all of this, it makes things a lot easier.”
10th House = Saturn = Capricorn:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Structure
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Long-term goals
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Authority
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * What you do over time
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Public reputation (not because it’s career, but because what you do consistently becomes known)
The Truth About Career:
Direct Quote: “Your ascendant point, remember that? Is your motivations, it’s like this, right? It’s kind of a combination of this. It is your motivations for why you do what you do. And then it’s ruler…that’s all ascendant. And its ruler, let’s say this is sitting in the fourth house. It’s all going to be based off of things that are either domesticated, nurturing, literally house and home, family anything that has to do with nurturing, anything that has to do with things that are just deeply personal to you or have some sort of emotional connection to you. That’s because the ascendant of the first house and its motivations, its actions, are being led into this area. You will do a career that aligns with that.”

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      2. Ascendant ruler’s house (where those motivations lead)
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      3. 6th house (daily work, service, routine)
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      4. 2nd house (skills, values, what you earn from)
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      5. 10th house (structure, long-term goals, what you build over time)
Career is a SYNTHESIS of multiple houses, not just MC.
The Truth About Midheaven:
Direct Quote: “Now what is the midheaven really?..The midheaven is taking the highest point in your chart, which aligns with the opposite of the IC and adds the sun to it…The IC is at the bottom of the chart, the darkest part, the personal side of the chart. The above stuff over here…is what I put out into the world; it’s not how I structure it, I don’t care how it structure, I care that I can do it. And it’s not about me actually physically doing the action, as much as me presenting it.”
MC = AMBITION
Direct Quote: “Ambition, literally a word that’s correlated to midheaven. Ambition, this is not my motivation; it is my ambition.”
Ambition vs. Motivation:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Motivation (Ascendant) = Why I do things, what drives me
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Ambition (Midheaven) = What I want to be known for, my aspirations
Real-Life Example:
Direct Quote: “When you have it in alignment here in the 10th house, and your midheaven’s in the 10th house, then the stuff you wanna do, your ambitions, and what you wanna put out in the world aligns with career, tradition, structure, authority, something you do for a long time. But when you don’t have it here, and you have it in one of these other four places, let’s say the ninth house, which is really popular, I have that; I had it in Tampa, I have it here in Los Angeles, it doesn’t align with authority at all.”

Direct Quote: “It doesn’t mean that I don’t care about authority; it just means that my aspirations, I don’t care about the long-term goals and structure of it. It means I care more about the adventure, the journey, the philosophy, making it bigger, doing much more, teaching, coaching, consulting, all the ninth house stuff, the culture of it. I want the experience; I wanna share the experience. I want that to be what I leave in this world. My ambitions are bigger, big picture stuff, Jupiter.”
His career (what he DOES): Teaching, consulting, creating content
His ambition (what he wants to LEAVE): Big-picture philosophy, shared experiences, cultural impact
These are related but different.
Practical Implications:
If you treat MC as career:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * You’ll confuse ambition with daily work
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * You’ll miss actual career indicators (Ascendant ruler, 6th, 2nd houses)
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * You’ll give vague, inaccurate career guidance
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * You’ll overlook what drives the person (Ascendant)
Corrective Guidance:
Direct Quote: “When someone asks you what your career is, they don’t say, hey, what do people know you for? What is the thing you wanna leave on this? No, they say, what do you do? That is why the ascendant, as we had here, that leads into your career more than anything else. But this is the way that you do it. These are your ambitions here with the midheaven.”
For career analysis:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      1. Start with Ascendant and its ruler (motivation → action)
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      2. Check 2nd house (skills, earning, values)
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      3. Check 6th house (daily work, service)
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      4. Check 10th house (structure, long-term goals)
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      5. Use MC to understand aspirations and what they want to be known for
Integration:
MC is a Vitality Anchor (like Ascendant), but serves a different function. Together, they structure purpose and ambition, but neither alone equals “career.”

MYTH #4: “Saturn (or Jupiter) is the father”
The Myth Statement:
Direct Quote: “Number four is you’ll hear all the time that Saturn’s the father. Sometimes you’ll hear Jupiter’s the father; neither one of them is the father, and we’ll talk about why.”
Why It’s Wrong:
The Logic Behind the Myth:
Traditional astrology creates an opposition:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * 4th house (IC) = mother
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * 10th house (MC) = father
This creates a mom vs. dad dynamic, fighting across an opposition.
Direct Quote: “So when you hear the argument between the fourth house being the mother and the tenth house being the father, they create this natural opposition that they’re looking for between mom and dad. But are mom and dad always opposite? Do they always fight each other? Are they always in a tug of war? Not in a good household. In a good household, they’re working together.”
The problem: This opposition framework assumes conflict, but good parents cooperate.
The Truth:
Direct Quote: “When we’re talking about the sun, the sun is the father; the sun gives life. You do not have life without the father, just like you don’t have nurturing and think about the womb without the mother. That is it.”
The Father = Sun = Leo = 5th House
Why:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Sun gives LIFE (generative principle)
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Father is the spark, the initiator
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Life cannot exist without the father’s contribution
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Sun = vitality, life force, purpose
Direct Quote: “What you really have here is the fourth house represents the mother, the fifth house represents the father. These two work in tandem; this one supports this one but doesn’t understand this one half of the time.”
4th House (Mother) + 5th House (Father):
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Adjacent, not opposite
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Mother (4th) supports father (5th)
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Father doesn’t always understand mother (semi-sextile aspect = misunderstanding)
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * But they work together, not against each other
What Saturn Actually Is:
Direct Quote: “Leo is the father, the sun is the father, the fifth house is the father; Saturn is not the father. Saturn is authority. The mother can be in an authority position. Teachers can be in authority positions, and teachers do not have to have a father-like, or even a mother-like influence.”
Saturn = AUTHORITY
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Structures
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Rules
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Long-term commitments
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Limitations
Authority is NOT the same as fatherhood:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Mothers can be authority figures
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Teachers are authorities but not parents
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Bosses, governments, institutions = authority, not fatherhood
Direct Quote: “The funny thing is they actually have more of a mother-like influence energetically than a father, with the opposition to the fourth house. Teachers who care teach better is what it is. People of authority who care are more respected; that’s the opposition between the fourth and the tenth house.”
Good authority figures care (4th house quality), creating the opposition’s complementary nature.
What the Father (Sun) Actually Represents:
Direct Quote: “Life, having fun, bringing purpose, a little bit of drama, personal expression, leadership. Those are all father things; those are all the sun. They are not Saturn.”
Father = Sun qualities:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Life-giving
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Fun, play, creativity
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Purpose and meaning
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Personal expression
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Leadership
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Drama (spotlight, attention)
These are 5th house themes, not 10th house.
Practical Implications:
If you treat Saturn as father:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * You’ll confuse authority issues with paternal relationships
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * You’ll miss the Sun’s role in vitality and life purpose
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * You’ll create false oppositions between parents
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * You’ll misread family dynamics
Corrective Guidance:
Always associate:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Mother = Moon, Cancer, 4th house
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Authority = Saturn, Capricorn, 10th house
Integration:
This ties to the foundational relationships of energy (one of the Four Pillars): planets, signs, and houses have natural correspondences that cannot be arbitrarily reassigned.

MYTH #5: “Mars is anger”
The Myth Statement:
Direct Quote: “Number five, Mars is usually attributed to anger; it is not anger.”
Why It’s Wrong:
The Logical Breakdown:
Direct Quote: “Mars, right? First house, Aries; they’re all the same energy. They are physical action and impulse. The fourth house, first house; the fourth house is Cancer moon, right? There is a square aspect between these two…This is emotion, or your relationship to emotion. Emotion itself is not defined. … But your relationship to emotion is Cancer. It does not mean that cancers are emotional, and that’s another problem with pop culture astrology.”
Key Distinctions:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Mars/Aries/1st house = physical action, impulse
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Moon/Cancer/4th house = relationship to emotion
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * These are separate energies
Direct Quote: “Anger is an emotion; emotions are not ruled by Mars. It’s the relationship of these two that creates a personal emotional insecurity. And because this is so fast that it reacts with this and that you don’t focus on the emotion or the actual root of what’s being said, what’s being done, it becomes anger and aggression.”
How Anger Actually Forms:
Anger = Mars (action) + Moon (emotion) in challenging aspect
When:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      1. Action is impulsive (Mars)
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      2. Emotion is not processed (Moon)
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      3. These two energies conflict (square, semi-sextile, opposition)
Result: Anger and aggression
Direct Quote: “And anger is always, always accompanied by physical action. People don’t get angry and not punch something, not storm off, not wave their hands; they don’t do that.”
Anger requires BOTH:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Emotional trigger (Moon)
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Physical expression (Mars)
Mars alone is just force, speed, energy—not anger.
The Truth:
Direct Quote: “So what is [Mars]? Well, this is aggression in terms of force, physical action, doing something, speed, adding energy into something…Mars is the physical body; the ascendant is the physical body; that’s your first house.”
Mars IS:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Physical action
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Force and speed
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Impulse
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Energy application
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * The physical body in motion
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Aggression (force), not anger (emotion)
Aspect Order Matters:
Direct Quote: “If you see somebody who has Mars square the moon, then that person is going to not process their emotions before their actions; they’re going to be impulsive, and that person may be a bit more angry or come across that way. If you see moon square Mars, it’s a very different thing because the order of those planets matters.”
Mars Square Moon:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Person acts before processing feelings
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Appears angry because they react physically before emotional awareness
Moon Square Mars:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Emotion doesn’t understand action
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Person feels intensely but action doesn’t match
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Different expression entirely
Even More Challenging:
Direct Quote: “Mars semi-sextile the moon…If Mars comes first, then it creates agitation. It means that’s even worse than a square because it doesn’t actually process emotions; it doesn’t understand emotions, and it makes things a Mars semi-square.”
Semi-sextile: The energies don’t see each other at all. If Mars comes first in the flow, action happens with zero emotional awareness.
Personal Example:
Direct Quote: “I have Mars conjunct the Moon…in a conjunction, those two energies are mixing together, which means you make decisions based on things that are personal to you. Your emotions are tied into your actions.”
In a conjunction, emotions and actions are integrated, not in conflict.
Practical Implications:
If you believe Mars = anger:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * You’ll stereotype Aries placements as “angry people”
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * You’ll miss the actual source of anger (Mars-Moon conflicts)
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * You’ll overlook healthy assertiveness and mistake it for aggression
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * You’ll fail to help clients understand emotional processing
Corrective Guidance:
Always interpret:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      1. Mars alone = action, force, speed, physical energy
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      2. Moon alone = emotional security, personal feelings
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      3. Mars-Moon aspects = where anger/agitation may arise (IF aspect is challenging)
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      4. Aspect order = determines which is the problem (action or emotion)
Integration:
This demonstrates the critical importance of energy flow (Pillar 1 of Alchemistic Astrology). The order and relationship between planets matters more than individual planets.

MYTH #6: “The 10th house is your physical appearance”
The Myth Statement:
Direct Quote: “Number six, your 10th house; they like to say that your 10th house has to do with your public image and therefore becomes your appearance; it is not your appearance.”
Why It’s Wrong:
Direct Quote: “They’re not seeing what you look like; they’re seeing the energy that you put out into the world in terms of Saturnian things in the 10th house.”
The Logic Error:
Pop astrology conflates:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Public image (how you’re perceived)
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Physical appearance (what you look like)
These are NOT the same thing.
Public image = reputation, what you’re known for (10th house)
Physical appearance = body, face, presence (1st house/Ascendant)
The Truth:
Direct Quote: “So the ascendant is your physical appearance; that is your body. Now, when we talk about the 10th house…it’s goals, structure, authority, time for the record.”
Ascendant/1st House = Physical Body:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * What you look like
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Your immediate presence
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Physical characteristics
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * How you move and act
10th House = Saturnian Themes:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Goals
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Structure
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Authority

Direct Quote: “So when people say that…the tenth house is your appearance, right? The tenth house is not your appearance…it is impulsive, reactionary, the very first thing that we do, it is not the mask we wear. It is literally the thing we do.”
Nuances:
There might be a correlation if:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Your Ascendant ruler is in the 10th house
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * There’s a strong connection between 1st and 10th houses
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * But that’s a derived relationship, not direct meaning
Practical Implications:
If you treat 10th house as appearance:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * You’ll confuse reputation with presentation

Corrective Guidance:
Always use:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Ascendant/1st house for physical appearance
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * 10th house for reputation, achievement, long-term goals
Integration:
This reinforces that houses, signs, and planets have natural correspondences that cannot be arbitrarily swapped. 1st = body (Aries/Mars), 10th = structure (Capricorn/Saturn).

MYTH #7: “Jupiter is money/financial abundance”
The Myth Statement:
Direct Quote: “Number seven, Jupiter is often attributed to money or financial abundance or gains; it is not; it has nothing to do with money.”
Why It’s Wrong:
Direct Quote: “In pop culture astrology, or PCA as we call it…they say it’s the husband, they say it’s God…they attribute everything to Jupiter; like they leave nothing out somehow.”
The Problem: Jupiter has become a catch-all for anything “good” or “abundant,” including money. But:
Jupiter = Expansion, NOT Money
Direct Quote: “Whenever you see a brain tumor that expands, Jupiter’s involved. Whenever you see somebody who’s struggling with weight, Jupiter’s involved. Whenever you see Jupiter come along…something expands.”
Jupiter expands WHATEVER is present:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Money? Jupiter expands it (MORE money)
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Debt? Jupiter expands it (MORE debt)
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Health issues? Jupiter expands them (WORSE health)
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Knowledge? Jupiter expands it (MORE learning)
Jupiter is neutral—it amplifies, it doesn’t inherently create wealth.
The Truth About Money:
Direct Quote: “Money is ruled by Taurus. Venus is money. Taurus is money. Jupiter, by literal definition, one planet, two planets, doesn’t understand money.”
Money = Venus = Taurus = 2nd House
Why:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Venus = value, possession, material things
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Taurus = stability, resources, what you own
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * 2nd house = earned income, skills, possessions
The Philosophical/Cultural Confusion:
Direct Quote: “So when you’re talking about financial abundance, we’re talking about luck; we’re talking about money. But the problem is the perception of luck is the idea that opportunity, which is based off of a numbers game, is that that’s just gonna come to us…what actually rules numbers is Gemini.”
Pop astrology confuses:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Luck (opportunity) with money (resources)
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Expansion (Jupiter) with wealth (Venus)
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Philosophy with materialism
Real-Life Example:
Direct Quote: “This is also for the record why teachers don’t make much money, because Jupiter is not about that…When you start focusing on Jupiter, you will not get money…You will not get money by doing a lot.”
Teachers: Jupiter-ruled profession (teaching, philosophy, expansion of knowledge)
Teachers’ salary: Usually low
Why? Because teaching is Jupiter (expansion, education), but money is Venus (material value). The system (Saturn) values money more than education.
Direct Quote: “But when Jupiter for higher education links up with Saturn…then teaching makes a lot of money because it’s going through this filter. But the average person is subject as a teacher to the system, which they didn’t even want to be a part of anyway. The system makes money; the teacher does not.”
When CAN Jupiter relate to money?
Only when Jupiter aspects Venus or the 2nd house. Then Jupiter expands the money that Venus rules.
But Jupiter alone? No money connection.
Practical Implications:
If you believe Jupiter = money:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * You’ll tell people to “manifest abundance” through Jupiter (won’t work)
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * You’ll miss the actual financial indicators (Venus, 2nd house)
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * You’ll create false hope around Jupiter transits
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * You’ll overlook Venus’s crucial role
Corrective Guidance:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      4. 8th house = shared resources, others’ money
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      5. Jupiter = expansion of whatever’s already there (can amplify money if connected to Venus/2nd, but doesn’t create it)
Integration:
This demonstrates color theory: same planet (Jupiter) in different contexts creates different results. Jupiter isn’t inherently “good”—it’s context-dependent.

MYTH #8: “Astrocartography lines show your best/worst places”
The Myth Statement:
Direct Quote: “Number eight is that astrocartography map lines somehow show you the exact place you’re supposed to use based on the line. So you’re supposed to go to a place, live there because that’s your good line. There are no good lines; there are no bad lines universally.”
Why It’s Wrong:
The Lines Are Limited:
Direct Quote: “These lines are not all the lines. Secondly, when you’re looking at these lines, each one of them has a marker…these are just conjunction points…”
Most astrocartography software only shows:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Conjunction lines (planet conjunct Ascendant, MC, Descendant, IC)
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Ignores squares, oppositions, pairon lines
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Shows only a fraction of astrological influence
The Lines Mean Different Things for Different People:
Direct Quote: “These lines just mean that Jupiter in my chart…is going to be conjunct my IC…for you, Pluto might be terrible. But for me, Pluto could be amazing because Pluto, sitting in my chart versus Pluto sitting in your chart…”
Same line ≠ same effect
Why:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Your Jupiter might be well-placed in your natal chart (expansion of good things)
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * My Jupiter might be challenging (expansion of problems)
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Lines don’t account for natal context
Real-Life Examples:
Born on Jupiter IC Line:
Direct Quote: “I was born on my Jupiter line…I did not have a wonderful childhood; I did not have a big family…all the definitions are almost always wrong because it factors absolutely nothing in.”
Pop astrology: “Jupiter IC = abundant, happy home life”
Reality: Difficult childhood, poverty, small family
Mars IC Line Experience:
Direct Quote: “Mars IC line, but people will tell you, oh, don’t go to your Mars IC line…But I had the best experience.”
Pop astrology: “Mars IC = dangerous, aggressive home life”
Reality: One of instructor’s favorite places
The Truth:
Direct Quote: “When you’re looking at astrocartography…everybody’s like, oh, your Sun line, oh, your Jupiter line, oh, your Venus line, blah, blah, blah…Now, in my chart…Jupiter line’s abundance…We talked before that it is not abundance…”
Astrocartography shows:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Where a planetary conjunction occurs for your unique chart
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Must be interpreted through your natal context
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Requires analyzing the relocated chart (full chart calculated for new location)
Technical Issues:
Direct Quote: “These lines are not even completely accurate because you have to factor in a couple of things. One is that the software is gonna do what the software wants to do…”
Different software calculates differently:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Mundo (in mundo) vs. Zodiacal
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Different calculation methods = different line placements
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * No single “correct” map
Practical Implications:
If you believe universal good/bad lines:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * You’ll move to “good” lines and be disappointed
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * You’ll avoid “bad” lines and miss opportunities
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * You’ll give clients inaccurate relocation advice
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * You’ll oversimplify complex relocational astrology
Corrective Guidance:

For proper astrocartography:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      1. Calculate relocated chart for each location
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      2. Analyze entire relocated chart, not just lines
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      3. Consider natal context (is this planet well-placed in your natal chart?)
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      4. Look at all aspects, not just conjunctions
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      5. Understand your goals for the relocation
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      6. Never use generic “Venus = love, Jupiter = luck” interpretations
Integration:
This demonstrates that astrology is contextual and relational. No single factor (like a line) can be understood in isolation from the whole chart.

MYTH #9: “Pisces is an emotional sign”
The Myth Statement:
Direct Quote: “And number nine is that Pisces is not an emotional sign.”
Why It’s Wrong:
Direct Quote: “Pisces energy is a sensitive, is a fragile energy. It is a connection to the ether and the connection to nothing, so it’s not about emotion. The tears, water being represented by Pisces and Neptune energy, is a form of release.”
The Confusion:
People see:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Water element → emotion
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Pisces = water sign → therefore emotional
But this conflates water element themes with specific water signs.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Psychological intensity
Pisces (12th house/Neptune):

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Connection to the ether
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Dissolution of boundaries
The Truth:
Direct Quote: “The moon, under all circumstances, is everything that is personal, everything that has to do with things that are very close to the chest, and your relationship to emotion.”
Emotion = Moon/Cancer/4th House
Pisces = Sensitivity, NOT Emotion
Direct Quote: “Pisces energy is a sensitive, is a fragile energy. It is a connection to the ether and the connection to nothing, so it’s not about emotion. The tears, water being represented by Pisces and Neptune energy, is a form of release.”
Pisces IS:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Sensitive to energies
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Fragile boundaries
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Release mechanism (tears, art, spirituality)
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Connection to collective/universal
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Letting go of what was
Pisces tears ≠ emotional tears
Pisces tears = release, dissolution, letting energy flow through you
Cancer tears = emotional response, personal feeling
Practical Implications:
If you treat Pisces as emotional:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * You’ll misunderstand Pisces placements as “overly emotional”
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * You’ll miss the actual emotional placements (Cancer/Moon)
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * You’ll pathologize healthy Piscean release as “too sensitive”
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * You’ll give wrong advice about emotional processing

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Sensitivity, release, spirituality = Neptune, Pisces, 12th house
Integration:
This clarifies distinctions within the water element trine: Cancer (personal emotion) → Scorpio (depth/transformation) → Pisces (release/transcendence). Each serves a different function.

MYTH #10: “The North Node is your future/destiny/life path”
The Myth Statement:
Direct Quote: “And number 10 is the North Node; they always attribute it to your future, your life path, your destiny. It is none of those things.”
Why It’s Wrong:
Direct Quote: “Everything in astrology that is the South, including the South node, South of the equator, everything is either current or past. Everything that is the North is future or leading us towards something, so by that very definition, you would be like, oh, well, then the North node is the future. But the thing is, it’s not…”
The Logical Trap:
Yes, North = future-oriented
But North Node ≠ predetermined future
The Problem with “Destiny”:
Destiny implies:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Predetermined path
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * No free will
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Fixed outcome
Alchemistic Astrology rejects fatalism:
Direct Quote: “And if you don’t understand it, then life is happening to you, instead of you using your free will to create the life you want.”
The North Node doesn’t predict a fixed future—it shows where growth is available.
The Truth:
Direct Quote: “North node itself…it has to do with default settings that have to do with Pluto’s themes…has to do with where control, intimacy, where shared resources and debt…Where it sits with government…”
The Nodes Are About:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * South Node = default settings, comfort zone, past patterns
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * North Node = growth direction, discomfort zone, aspirational development
Direct Quote: “It has nothing to do with the future; it has to do with stepping out of our, it’s not even a comfort zone…It has more to do with what are we used to and what are the default settings versus what are we not used to, but helps us with our growth.”
North Node = Emotional Growth Direction
Direct Quote: “So the North node is not your future; it is your emotional growth.”
Real-Life Example:
Instructor’s North Node in Cancer, 12th House:
Direct Quote: “In order to achieve something that has to do with this, your north node is going to talk about your relationship to your mother and your family and what you didn’t have and what you felt uncomfortable with within their yourself node or your default settings…North Node in Cancer, 12th house = ‘never had a spiritual connection with my family’, abandonment issues, learning comfort in solitude and emotional expression.”
What this means:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * South Node comfort = independence, isolation (learned in childhood)
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * North Node growth = family connection, spiritual/emotional bonding (uncomfortable, aspirational)
This is NOT “your destiny”—it’s where growth is possible if you choose to pursue it.
What About Purpose?
Student Question: “Is it purpose?”
Direct Quote: “It is not purpose; either purpose again is always the sun. However, because we’re talking about the ecliptic, you are bringing an element of purpose, right? So these nodes, and it doesn’t matter which planet you’re talking about, these nodes are always bringing purpose.”
Clarification:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Purpose = Sun (always)
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Nodes = relate to ecliptic, which involves purpose
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * But North Node ≠ life purpose
Nodes + planets:
 Every planet has nodes. The Moon’s nodes are what we usually call “North Node” and “South Node,” but these are specifically about emotional and soul-level growth.
Practical Implications:
If you treat North Node as destiny:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * You create fatalism (“this is what I’m meant to do”)
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * You pressure clients to conform to a “path”
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * You ignore free will and choice
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * You may discourage current life directions that don’t match the Node
Corrective Guidance:
Use North Node to:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      1. Identify emotional growth opportunities
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      2. Understand default patterns (South Node) vs. aspirational qualities (North Node)
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      3. Recognize where discomfort leads to expansion
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      4. Support clients in choosing to develop North Node qualities
Never use it to:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Predict fixed future
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Define “life purpose” (that’s the Sun)
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Create obligation (“you MUST do this”)
Integration:
This reinforces that free will and alchemization are central to Alchemistic Astrology. The chart shows potential—you choose how to use it.

SECTION 4: OVERARCHING THEMES & META-LESSONS
Pattern #1: Reductionism is Always Wrong
Every myth reduces complexity to simplicity:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Ascendant = mask (ignores motivations, body, immediate reactions)
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * 8th house = death (ignores transformation, intimacy, shared resources)
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * MC = career (ignores ambition, aspirations, public legacy)
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Mars = anger (ignores action, force, impulse)
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Jupiter = money (ignores expansion, philosophy, growth)
The meta-lesson: When astrology becomes a single keyword, it becomes wrong.
Pattern #2: Context is Everything
Every myth fails because it ignores context:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Astrocartography lines mean different things for different natal charts
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Mars only creates anger when combined with challenging Moon aspects
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Jupiter only relates to money when connected to Venus/2nd house
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * The same chart shows different stories through different lenses (Transcript 14)
The meta-lesson: Relational, contextual interpretation is the only accurate approach.
Pattern #3: Energy Flow > Static Meanings
Many myths fail because they treat charts as static:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Death shows in transits, not natal 8th house
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * North Node is about growth process, not fixed destiny
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Ascendant is immediate reaction, not static mask
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Order of planets in aspects matters (Mars square Moon ≠ Moon square Mars)
The meta-lesson: Charts are dynamic systems, not collections of fixed symbols.
Pattern #4: Commercial Incentive Corrupts Accuracy
Direct Quote: “They do it because it makes them money.”
Every myth persists because:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Simple sells better than complex
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Stereotypes are easier to market than nuance
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Fear/hope-based predictions drive engagement
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Mass market requires oversimplification
The meta-lesson: Accuracy often conflicts with profitability in astrology.
Pattern #5: Pop Astrology Inverts Truth
Direct Quote: “To get what pop culture people are saying, just turn it into the opposite, or I’ll do that for you.”
Many myths are literally backwards:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Ascendant = fake (actually: most authentic)

If no → probably a myth.

SECTION 6: STUDENT Q&A - ADVANCED CLARIFICATIONS
Q1: Mars Square Moon vs. Moon Square Mars
Student Question: “What is the difference between Moon squared Mars and Mars squared Moon?”
Direct Quote: “One of those planets is in the lead of the other planet…There’s a difference between your actions not understanding your emotions and your emotions not understanding your actions. They’re literally opposite. But when you Google things, they won’t differentiate because literally no other system of astrology separates energy flow out…Energy flow has to do with the timing of planets.”
The Answer:
Mars Square Moon:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Mars (action) comes first in energy flow
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Action happens without emotional processing
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Person acts impulsively, then realizes emotional impact later
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * “Actions don’t understand emotions”
Moon Square Mars:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Moon (emotion) comes first in energy flow
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Emotional reaction happens, but action doesn’t match
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Person feels deeply but can’t act effectively on feelings
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * “Emotions don’t understand actions”
Why Other Systems Miss This:

Only Alchemistic Astrology tracks energy flow sequence.
Q2: Natal vs. Progression vs. Relocation Charts
Student Question: “At what point in the natal chart do you use your progression chart, relocated chart versus your natal chart? So all three are used at the same time. Always is the progression relocation only for certain questions in astrology?”
Direct Quote: “OK, so yes, there are certain questions where if you ask me, and it’s always based on how you phrase the question. So how is the current actually asking the question? Sometimes I feel like I just, I don’t know. I just feel stuck; that verbiage, that phraseology immediately tells me that, yes, I should check the transits, but it’s in your progress chart.”
The Answer:
Question Phrasing Determines Chart Type:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * “I feel stuck” → Progressions (internal, long-term development)
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * “What’s happening now?” → Transits (current events)
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * “Should I move to X city?” → Relocation chart (geographical context)
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * “What’s my baseline?” → Natal chart (fundamental blueprint)
All Three Used Simultaneously:
For comprehensive readings:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      1. Natal = blueprint, potential, fundamental nature
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      2. Progressions = internal development, soul evolution
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      3. Relocations = how environment shifts emphasis
Q3: Death in Charts - Which Chart Type?
Student Question: “So when you were looking at the charts earlier regarding death, would you use relocation or progress chart?”
Direct Quote: “I use the natal chart. And remember, most times death is not in your own chart; it’s in other people’s charts. Why? Because Pluto is literally other people. So the death actually comes from outside of yourself; so is Neptune. Neptune is not you, so it’s not showing in your natal chart.”
The Answer:
For death analysis:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      1. Natal chart = baseline
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      2. Transits = timing (when)
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      3. Other people’s charts = where it shows most clearly
Why death shows in others’ charts:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Pluto = other people, transformation from outside
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Neptune = dissolution, endings, also external
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Death is an event (transit-based), not a trait (natal)
Direct Quote: “But you usually use your natal chart. Sometimes, you can use the progressions as well, but your progressions are internalized energy.”
Q4: What IS Alchemistic Astrology?
Student Question: “I’m new and not yet a part of Mystic Rebels, Mystic Circle. What is alchemistic astrology? Are there any resources to understand?”
Direct Quote: “Alchemistic astrology is the result of me trying to figure out astrology. And me going through all these different systems of astrology to try to figure out what was right and what was wrong…So when I got into astrology, I see the same thing. I’m like, this is inefficient, this is inaccurate. So I did not get into astrology to fix astrology or to develop a system; that just happened as a by-product…When people ask me about resources or books, there’s nothing because I developed a system. I developed one that is reliable and accurate.”

Q5: Mercury Conjunct Uranus - Learning Disabilities?
Student Question: “Does Mercury in conjunct Uranus cause learning disabilities?”
Direct Quote: “It depends on how it sits in your chart. It can, it depends on the order. Is it Mercury in conjunct Uranus, or is it Uranus in conjunct Mercury? But how you learn things, and your strokes of genius are going to be automatic. And if you try to focus on the mechanics behind it, you can get, you can lose the facts, or vice versa, depending on how it is. I don’t know that I would call it learning disabilities, but I would call it a disconnect between understanding how things work versus what our perception of those things are.”
The Answer:
Mercury conjunct Uranus:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Not necessarily “learning disabilities”

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Uranus conjunct Mercury = different expression
Not pathology—just difference.
Q6: 8th House vs. Retrograde
Student Question: “Do having planets in the eighth house feel like a planet is in retrograde?”

SECTION 7: PRACTICAL APPLICATION & FUTURE DIRECTION
How Students Should Use This Information
Direct Quote: “The point isn’t just to debunk it… What is… which is what we’re doing here. … If you believe any of those things that pop culture astrology tells you, and those astrologers constantly push out, you’re never going to understand what they really mean because you’re believing the definition of something that’s inaccurate.”
Actionable Steps:
1. Replace, Don’t Just Reject
When you encounter a myth:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Don’t just think “that’s wrong”
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Ask “what IS correct?”
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Learn the accurate interpretation
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Understand WHY the myth exists
2. Verify Against Your Chart
Direct Quote: “If you Google something or use ChatGBT or whatever, and the definitions are almost always wrong because it factors absolutely nothing in…you have to look at your own chart…”
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Never accept universal claims
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Always check: “Does this apply to MY chart?”
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Context is everything
3. Question Everything
Direct Quote: “Avoid ‘cookie-cutter’ pop astrology and seek true understanding. If you see a claim, always check if it makes sense for your chart and situation; do not blindly accept ‘one-size-fits-all’ advice.”
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Just because it’s popular doesn’t mean it’s accurate
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Just because it’s in a book doesn’t mean it’s true
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Test claims against real-life experience
4. Educate Others
Direct Quote: “So the reason why we do what we do is to help people at the end of the day. Like, yes, I have this system that I’ve created. Is it done? No, it needs to expand. It needs to evolve.”
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Share accurate information when you see myths
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Correct gently but firmly
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Provide the right understanding, not just criticism
5. Use Astrology for Empowerment
Direct Quote: “The reason why what we teach what we teach is so that you can use this. Because if you don’t understand it, then life is happening to you, instead of you using your free will to create the life you want.”
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Astrology is a tool, not a prison
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Use it to understand options, not limitations
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Alchemize energy to create your desired life
Warning: Additional Myths Not Covered
Bonus Myth Mentioned:
Direct Quote: “Which also, in a different video, will talk about why Saturn, yes, Saturn and Capricorn energy is not hard work; that is also a pop culture lie. We don’t have that on the list, so we’re not gonna talk about that.”
Other myths exist beyond these 10. The instructor hints at future debunking sessions.
Essential Dignity:
Direct Quote: “Essential dignity is pure nonsense the idea that a planet works better…”
Also debunked, though not in this top 10 list.

Mystic Circle Integration
Direct Quote: “Once we reach a certain amount of people in Mystic Circle, we’re gaining quite a bit of people, and the more people who go, it’ll justify the cost because there’s a cost for that software. So we were either going to add it on…or we get enough people that we don’t have to charge separate. We’ll just include it as a perk.”

The Four Pillars Reinforced
Direct Quote: “I have like four or five main principles in alchemistic astrology. This one and the foundational relationship of energies, color theory, and block theory. Those four pillars of alchemistic astrology are literally the separating and defining things that make this system work and other systems not.”
Pillar 1: Energy Flow
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Mars square Moon ≠ Moon square Mars
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Order matters in aspects
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Timing and sequence determine expression
Pillar 2: Foundational Relationships

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Aries = 1st = Mars (natural correspondences)
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * These relationships are fundamental

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Context determines whether planet’s influence is positive or negative
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Same planet + different context = different meaning
Pillar 4: Block Theory

SECTION 9: APP DEVELOPMENT SPECIFICATIONS
Myth-Busting Features for the App
Critical Implementation: The app must actively correct pop astrology myths, not just avoid them.
Feature 1: Pop Myth Detector
Functionality:
 When displaying chart interpretations, flag common myths and provide corrections.
Example Display:
🚫 COMMON MYTH: "Your 8th house shows how you'll die"


✅ TRUTH: The 8th house relates to transformation, intimacy, 
shared resources, and depth—NOT literal death. Death events 
show in TRANSITS and progressions, not natal placements.

App’s approach:
🗺️ ASTROCARTOGRAPHY: Venus Line Analysis


YOUR CHART CONTEXT:
• Natal Venus: [Position, aspects, dignity]
• Venus rules your: [Houses]
• Current dignity: [Well-placed or challenging?]


⚠️ IMPORTANT: Generic "Venus = love" interpretations ignore 
YOUR unique chart. Venus in your chart specifically relates to:
• [Specific themes based on natal placement]
• [Specific challenges or strengths]


This Venus line would emphasize THESE themes in this location, 
not universal "love and romance."

⚡ ENERGY FLOW MATTERS:


If MARS comes first (earlier by degree):
• Action precedes emotional processing
• Tendency to act impulsively
• "Actions don't understand emotions"
• May appear aggressive or reactive


If MOON comes first (earlier by degree):
• Emotion precedes effective action
• Feelings strong but action inadequate
• "Emotions don't understand actions"
• May feel stuck or frustrated




YOUR CHART: [Which planet comes first]
YOUR EXPRESSION: [Specific interpretation]


🚫 MYTH: "Mars = anger" (Wrong! Anger emerges from Mars-Moon 
conflict, not Mars alone)


Feature 6: “Test Against Your Chart” Tool
Interactive Feature:
🧪 MYTH TESTING LAB


Claim: "Jupiter brings financial abundance"


LET'S TEST THIS IN YOUR CHART:


1. Your Jupiter: [Position, aspects, dignity]
2. Your 2nd house (actual money): [Ruler, planets, aspects]
3. Jupiter's connection to 2nd house: [Aspects, if any]


RESULT:
☐ Jupiter directly aspects your 2nd house or Venus
   → Jupiter MAY expand financial matters for you
☐ Jupiter has no connection to 2nd house/Venus
   → Jupiter relates to [other themes], NOT money


CONCLUSION: [Personalized based on actual chart]

And if you want to learn all of this stuff, I appreciate all you guys for being here. Thank you for making this a, an enjoyable experience. This is the first time we did this. As you can see, I had some hiccups and hangups, but we got through it. You guys got all your information.

SUMMARY: THE 10 MYTHS CORRECTED
#
	MYTH
	TRUTH
	1
	Ascendant = mask you wear
	Ascendant = motivations, physical body, immediate reactions (Vitality Anchor)
	2
	8th house = how you’ll die
	Death shows in TRANSITS, not natal 8th house; 8th = transformation, intimacy, shared resources
	3
	Midheaven = your career
	MC = ambition, what you want to be known for; Career = Ascendant ruler + 2nd + 6th + 10th houses
	4
	Saturn = the father
	Sun = father; Saturn = authority (anyone can be authority)
	5
	Mars = anger
	Mars = action/force; Anger = Mars + Moon in challenging aspect
	6
	10th house = appearance
	1st house/Ascendant = appearance; 10th = reputation, structure, long-term goals
	7
	Jupiter = money/abundance
	Jupiter = expansion (of anything); Venus/Taurus/2nd house = money
	8
	Astrocartography lines = good/bad places
	Lines must be interpreted through YOUR natal chart context; no universal good/bad
	9
	Pisces = emotional sign
	Pisces = sensitivity, release, spirituality; Cancer/Moon = emotion
	10
	North Node = future/destiny
	North Node = emotional growth direction; Sun = purpose; Free will determines future

1.1 Class Purpose: What is “Natal Retrograde Optimization”?
Primary Goal:
 The Natal Retrograde Optimization class teaches participants to deeply understand how natal (birth chart) planetary retrogrades shape individual personalities and experiences, and how to interpret these energies accurately when reading astrology charts.
Verbatim Instructor Quote:
“Obviously, welcome to the natal retrograde optimization webinar. Here, the purpose of this is for you guys to be able to understand how to use retrogrades within a natal chart as you’re reading charts for other people, also being able to do the same thing. As we are looking at a lot of the energies, it’s very natural for us to think that. But we learn things as direct energies; we don’t learn them as retrograde energy.”
Key Distinction - “Optimization” vs. “Understanding”:
 The intent is NOT only to understand retrogrades intellectually, but to actually leverage (“optimize”) these energies—recognizing that retrogrades are key markers of uniqueness and authenticity, signaling how everyone is different from others.
Verbatim:
“So each one of these retrogrades is sitting in your chart for a reason, right? It’s part of what makes you different from the next person, and honing in and harnessing them is extremely important. And when it comes to conformity and all of us being the same, your retrograde is one of those things that says, I’m not the same.”
Expected Outcome:
“I hope you guys are able to look at your own charts, and when you look at other people’s charts, have a better idea of how these retrogrades play out. And more importantly, be able to assess the pros and cons so that you can say, okay, well, this is how this works. This is how it will always work, progressions aside, so we need to work with this. So when you’re dealing with a client, you’re talking to your family members, you’re looking at your own chart and you’re like, okay, this does not act direct, so I have to understand that it acts this way. And once I align with that, I will become powerful and things will work much better for me.”

1.2 Complete Definition of Retrograde Planets
Astronomical Definition
Verbatim Explanation:
“Okay, so as we go through each planet, I want to discuss different things, but the first thing I think that’s important is whenever you see a retrograde; so let’s use this as an example, so we have We have this energy here, so Mars is going to go retrograde. Mars, the first planet, probably the best one to start with, is going to go retrograde this year, December 6, 2024, at six degrees in the sign of Leo. This particular one is going to go backwards; right, backwards retrogrades don’t actually move backwards. A retrograde is the orbit of that planet and the orbit of Earth, where we live, and as it comes around, it seems to do that. Where it seems to switch positions, it seems like we’re going faster than the other planet, which our perception, our relationship of orbit path, makes the other planet look like it’s going backwards.”
Critical Clarification:
“And from the measurement from our vantage point on Earth, that planet is not at 19 degrees anymore, shifting back; or in this case, it’s not at six degrees anymore, it’s shifting back five degrees, four degrees. Oh wait, now it’s back in Cancer. But it’s a perception thing: the planet is not slowing down, the planet is not moving backwards. It’s all about perception, and this is the energetic relationship of that planet versus our planet.”
Key Principle: The planet maintains its orbital speed; retrograde motion is purely perceptual from Earth’s vantage point.

Astrological Definition
Natal Chart Imprint:
 When a planet is retrograde in a natal chart (marked with ‘R’), its energy is fundamentally different from direct (prograde) planets.
Verbatim Core Concept:
“What ends up happening is every retrograde in your chart, every single one of those planets has already hit that point before. And that energy that your natal chart is, is a cosmic snapshot that is imprinted on you at that exact moment you were born to create your natal chart, which means you are embodied or imbued with all of the energy from the moment and everything the planets were doing at that time, which means prior to you being born, this planet, let’s say it’s Mars, right?”
“The first one that we’re gonna talk about right here is Mars. Let’s say Mars, you are born during this retrograde. So, let’s say you are born with a, let’s make it easy, five-degree Mars retrograde in Leo. So, you were born just after the retrograde started. That means that Mars, the planet of action and everything that is thematic of that planet, was moving forward before and reached a certain point before where it had slowed down in retrograde and then decided to go backwards based on our orbit. So, because it had already reached that point, you are imbued with the energies of going back. You are imbued with the energies of having to reevaluate, which also means you’re imbued with the energies of I’ve already done this. I’ve already been this; I already have this.”
________________


Core Characteristics of Retrograde Energy
The “Already Done” Paradox:
“And that is the confusion of retrogrades in your chart: the feeling like I already have the ability to do. I already have the ability; I’ve already done this. So you’re constantly reworking things that are already done, which is why you’re not actually taking action because the action happened before you were born. Does that make sense? So when you have a retrograde in your chart and the action’s already been done for you, the universe, everybody else that came before you is already done, you’re in a position of reevaluating.”
The Inward Turn:
“And this is why people who have a Mars retrograde turn their energy inward, and they have a very difficult time asserting themselves. They have a very difficult time taking action, starting new projects because it already was started before they were born. The energy of their imprint, their natal chart happened already. The thing already started, but the but the challenge is that for you, it didn’t start. You’re imbued with energy post starting, but nothing’s there.”
The Missing Quality:
“So for you, there’s nothing there. That is why I say when you were first born, you’re lacking these energies or you feel like you’re lacking these energies. These themes are missing in your life, and they work erratic, and you don’t have any connection to them. You have no idea because you weren’t there for the start of it.”
________________


Saturn Retrograde Example (Further Illustration)
Verbatim:
“And this applies for all the planets. Take Saturn, jump the Saturn real quick; Saturn has to do with authority and structure in your life, and that authority and structure was already set before you were born. And then, once you were born with a retrograde Saturn, that imprint is on you; it already happened, but you didn’t start it.”
“So you, there’s an expectation of structure, but it’s not there for you. There’s no authority there for you. Authority you don’t make, it doesn’t make any sense, but at the same time you feel like you already have the authority. You feel like you’ve already done things, or you should already be able to do things with Mars.”

1.3 The Four Planetary Motion States
Complete Framework:
Verbatim:
“When you want to understand pro grade, pre grade, post grade, retrograde, right? Those are the four movements of planets. Pro grade is just direct; okay? It’s just normal, it’s moving forward. It’s not in pre grade, it’s not retrograde, it’s not post grade, it is pro grade, and it just means it’s normally moving, and it’s it’s It’s whatever velocity speed that it’s going through. So we know that the direct is just acting out the way that we learn direct to be.”
1. Prograde (Direct)
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Normal forward motion
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * “Acting out the way that we learn direct to be”
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Standard planetary function and expression
2. Pre-grade (Pre-Retrograde Station)
Definition:
“When you dive deeper into retrograde, you also want to kind of take a look at the ephemeris at the time you were born to understand what your planet’s really doing because your planet might not be retrograde, but it could have been two days before retrograde, which means it’s more almost inertial, meaning it’s almost retrograde. It is slowed down; it is not prograde. Just because there’s no R on it does not mean that it’s not giving you some of those vibes as it slows down.”
Critical for App Development: Planets within 1-2 degrees or days of retrograde station should be flagged as exhibiting retrograde-like qualities even without the ‘R’ symbol.
3. Retrograde
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Apparent backward motion from Earth’s perspective
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Energy turned inward
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Themes of reworking, reevaluation, revisiting
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Imprinted with “already been done” energy
4. Post-grade (Post-Retrograde Station)
Verbatim:
“So we have the retrograde is coming here and anything once it reaches the second time around. So once Mars hits six degrees, it’s going to go retrograde. When it goes back, it’s going to go to 17 degrees of Cancer, and then it’s going to go forward; it’s going to hit six degrees again. And anything after that point is prograde; it’s going normal again. The period of time after a retrograde, so February 24th, when this planet goes all the way back to here, anything from 17 degrees Cancer back up to six degrees Leo, where it already was before, is called post-grade.”
Post-grade Significance: The planet is moving forward again but still traversing degrees it has already covered twice (once forward pre-retrograde, once backward during retrograde). This creates a “completion” or “integration” quality.

Frequency and Rarity
Inner Planet Retrogrades:
Mercury:
“Mercury retrograde, I have a Mercury. Anyone else have a Mercury retrograde? I do. A lot of people would. Anita, is that what you? Yeah. All right, a lot of people do. This is a really common one, happens three times a year for usually about three weeks at a time. So while it’s cumulatively not that long, it’s still a decent amount of the population that has it.”
Venus and Mars:
“Mars are very rare; Silas, Mars and Venus only happen every two years, so both of those are rare retrogrades. I don’t have retrograde my station direct. Yeah, okay. … Venus is another rare one.”
Outer Planets:
 Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto retrograde for approximately 5-6 months each year, making natal retrogrades of these planets much more common. These are considered generational retrogrades because large cohorts share them.
________________


1.5 General Principles of Retrograde Interpretation
Inward vs. Outward Energy
Core Directional Framework:
“Because the natural flow of a retrograde planet is to go inward, is to go backwards, is to revisit because again, you’re imprinted with all the energy of a time where Mars had already been here, and it also means you have to do it different.”
Verbatim:
“Often, you’ll end up asserting yourself to yourself. So if there’s any anger with a partner, you could blame yourself, or you could like just communicate with yourself, and it doesn’t actually fix any of the issues or any of the trauma, … You just want to be careful because retrogrades compound.”
________________


Compounding Effect
Critical Warning:
“You just want to be careful because retrogrades compound. So as you rework things, you can get so hung up on this like snow pile of reworking and redoing that it stops you from moving forward.”
Positive Reframe:
“But you can see action within action. You can do things within what you’re doing. So … because you see opportunity for doing things within something you’re already doing.”
________________


Early Life Experience vs. Later Mastery
Initial Challenge:
“A lot of people look at retrogrades as like these huge burdening challenges, and they definitely feel that way coming up because in the first parts of your life, these are areas that don’t seem to work. Right, there are things that you’re you feel like you’re missing or you’re lacking. And those are things that you have to go inward to find. So that’s the first thing to realize, that the beginning of your life, wherever you have a retrograde, you can expect to not have that planet’s energy playing out in a normal way.”
Path to Empowerment:
“So each one of these retrogrades is sitting in your chart for a reason, right? It’s part of what makes you different from the next person, and honing in and harnessing them is extremely important.”
________________


Authenticity and Uniqueness
Verbatim:
“Your retrograde is one of those things that says, I’m not the same. It’s kind of like Chiron in in its way, and Chiron can obviously be retrograde. We won’t be talking about that today; we’ll do a different webinar for Chiron, which will include Chiron retrograde in that one.”
“But as that one represents you being authentic and unique and doing things for yourself, and that area of life not working, that’s a part of your authenticity. But so are your retrogrades.”
________________


Common Misconceptions Debunked
Misconception: Retrogrades Are Purely Negative
Verbatim:
“A lot of people look at retrogrades as like these huge burdening challenges, and they definitely feel that way coming up … but I want you to understand why they’re not direct and how they’re different from being direct and what that can mean negatively. Because if we understand how it can be bad or potentially negative or overwhelming, because that’s what happens with retrogrades, it gives you that inverse Jupiter vibe.”
“I want to balance out the good, and I want to make sure that the bad is subdued, right, as much as we can… I know I’m focusing kind of on the negative side of it, and I don’t want you to think that retrogrades are negative; they absolutely aren’t.”

(Mars: NOT retrograde - “I don’t have retrograde my station direct”)
Personal Impact Statement:
“Most of my planets are retrograde, kind of licking my lips on this one because I’m kind of proud of it, but also kind of ashamed of it.”

Venus Retrograde Personal Experience
Verbatim:
“Venus is another rare one. However, I’m going to go to me. Doesn’t look like it, not on this call. Anyway, it’s not common, but guess what? Second house is naturally Taurus; its ruler in my chart is retrograde. Seventh house, Libra ruled by Venus; its ruler retrograde. So for me, as Venus pertains to money and as Venus pertains to relationships, I have both retrograde. So when I talk about, I was born in the ghetto, and money was difficult for me, and life was challenging, and relationships were tough. It’s not just this, but this was a contributing factor to it.”
“I didn’t understand money, or value, or self-worth, or anything like that growing up because again, my second house ruler, and it would be the same for Venus.”

Jupiter Retrograde Personal Experience
Verbatim:
“Jupiter retrograde, Jupiter is expansion and abundance and philosophy and culture, right? It’s all these things. Guess what I don’t have and didn’t have growing up? Any of those things, no abundance, not a big family.”
“But I’ll tell you what I did get is all of my friends. That I’ve had growing up through all of my recreation and activities and martial arts and all of that from my childhood. I went with their family, the ruler right there, boom with their family and their family and their culture. All of my friends were ethnic, every single one. …So, but that’s the retrograde, and I dove deep into it; I took all of their, their culture to me and said, why are you doing that?”

Saturn Retrograde Personal Experience
Verbatim:
“Saturn’s a fun one. Saturn, to me, is this you? …I have this, most of my planets are retrograde, kind of licking my lips on this one because I’m kind of proud of it, but also kind of ashamed of it. But I have my Saturn retrograde as well. I have, uh, my 10th house with Chiron.”
“I also have a Saturn retrograde, so I don’t verbalize mine in the third house. I don’t talk about being successful. I don’t think I’m successful. Like I talk about it all the time. I’ve got my name up on a building, I got money, I got whatever. I’ve done a lot of really cool things, but in my mind, in my energy, in my brain, I don’t attribute that to being successful. I’m not successful yet. There’s always something else, and it’s because I haven’t really—I’m still 42 years old. I haven’t figured this out yet, what success means to me.”

Personal Optimization Journey
Verbatim:
“I finally figured it out, at least partially, but it took, I’m 42 years old. Now it took me a long time to figure this out. I don’t want people to figure out 40 years later, or 30, or whatever age you want to take it from the vantage of. I don’t want you to, to wait that long to figure this out; I want you to figure it out now so that in 40, 30, 40 years from now, you’re just like living on a yacht or something. I don’t know, whatever you’re doing, whatever your goal is, just happy, whatever your form of happiness. I want that for you.”

Verbatim:
“So Mercury’s about communication, thinking, logic, learning, choices, options, and analytical strength.”

How Retrograde Modifies Mercury Energy
The Skeptical Mind:
“With a Mercury retrograde or a third house ruler retrograde or a sixth house ruler retrograde is not to trust it, not to believe what we’re hearing, to criticize the details and the facts.”
“We don’t even know what it is yet, but we’re already in that stance that whatever that fact is, I don’t believe it; show it to me, prove it to me kind of energy.”
Internal Dialogue Before External Expression:
“Communication … starts in your head and then some point during your either sentence or paragraph or conversation, you start speaking.”
“With a Mercury retrograde, you take it upon yourself to discern, to find the facts, to pull it all together, to figure out what is true, what’s a fact, and what’s the, I’ve criticized it enough to know it’s real.”
Talking to Yourself:
“You had the conversation retrograded with yourself. You talk to yourself and not, and there’s a lot of people who talk to themselves and there’s usually a…the third house ruler is retrograde or Mercury is retrograde. Like you are your conversationalist, and you, in order to figure things out, you have to talk through it to yourself.”
________________


Strengths of Mercury Retrograde
Deep Analytical Ability:
“You’re able to work inward; you’re able to, to see the logic within the logic, you’re able to see the details that other people miss, so there is a blessing.”
Revolutionary Thinking:
“You have an ability to rework things in a way that no one else has thought of, and that can make you a revolutionary person.”
Document Expertise:
“You have a gift of reworking and rewording things with a Mercury retrograde or a third house retrograde when it comes to documents and making sure that those words are in your favor.”
________________


Challenges of Mercury Retrograde
Miscommunication:
“It creates miscommunication with other people constantly, because they don’t know where you’re coming from.”
Assumed Context:
“Sometimes that communication starts in your head and then…when you start talking to somebody, you forget that the whole conversation you’ve had in your head has not been said to them.”
“Communication with other people, not just writing, but any information that needs to be communicated, can suffer because you may assume too much about what people know.”
Decision Paralysis:
“With a Mercury retrograde, how many times are you going to think this thing through before you make a decision on something?..you think it and you rethink it and you think it over.”
Document Assumptions:
“Do not assume you know what’s in a document. Because that can be a challenge, I think I already know everything we’ve talked about…you’re not reading it.”

Optimization Techniques
1. Explicit Communication:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Talk through things explicitly with others, not only to yourself
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Don’t assume others know what you’re thinking
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Verbalize the internal conversation
2. Solve Complex Problems:
“You can solve problems that other people can’t solve.”
3. Allow Decision-Making:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Recognize the tendency to over-analyze
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Set decision deadlines for yourself
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Allow yourself to make decisions rather than getting stuck in over-analysis
4. Leverage Document Skills:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Use your gift for reviewing and rewording
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Apply this to contracts, agreements, creative writing
5. Avoid Over-Explaining:
“You can over-explain everything for other people—and that becomes a problem. We’re good at it, but it’s not ours to do unless we’re asked.”

House and Sign Considerations
Example: Mercury Retrograde in 1st House (Anita’s Chart):
“Anita’s chart, where’s your Mercury? Ah, in the first house. So you have a mercury that acts as an Aries, Taurus, and Libra because you have that conjunction here and Scorpio. So you have that mixture here, but it all spawns off of Scorpio and kind of feeds in…So it’s like I’m already diving deeper.”
Stellium Complexity:
“The Mercury retrograde itself, yours is combined into this, so yours is, we have to break down a little bit more. Mine, for instance, is sitting at six degrees all by herself, you know, just floating up there. But yours is sitting here at the tail end of a stellium.”

Verbatim:
“Venus pertains to money and as Venus pertains to relationships…”
“Venus is having both the second house and the seventh house retrograde… relationships, value, money, talents, artistic expression, self-worth, beauty.”

How Retrograde Modifies Venus Energy
Dual House Impact:
“Venus retrograde is like having the seventh house and the second house retrograde. So, whenever you’re talking about Mercury, we talked about Virgo, and we talked about Gemini. So, having the sixth house and the third house retrograde, that’s what having a Mercury retrograde is. It’s having both of those. Venus is having both the second house and the seventh house retrograde.”
Value Confusion:
“So, when Venus is there, having money or understanding wealth, worth, and value can be very challenging for these people. In order to gain it, they have to go in and they have to go figure it out.”
Hidden Talents:
“A retrograde doesn’t mean that you’re not talented with Venus. It actually means you probably are very talented, but you don’t know what your talents are or how to use your talents, because a retrograde means you already had it. Now you’re figuring it out, you’re reworking it.”

Instructor’s Venus Retrograde Experience
Verbatim:
“Guess what? Second house is naturally Taurus; its ruler in my chart is retrograde. Seventh house, Libra ruled by Venus; its ruler retrograde. So for me, as Venus pertains to money and as Venus pertains to relationships, I have both retrograde. So when I talk about, I was born in the ghetto, and money was difficult for me, and life was challenging, and relationships were tough. It’s not just this, but this was a contributing factor to it.”
“I didn’t understand money, or value, or self-worth, or anything like that growing up because again, my second house ruler, and it would be the same for Venus.”

Relationship Patterns
Lack of Discernment:
“You just assume that everybody is someone they could have a relationship with. And that’s a challenge with Venus retrograde: you’re not discerning about who to be in a relationship with because you just assume everybody, anybody, and you’re supposed to rework what is, what is value to you?”
Revisiting Relationships:
“These are the type of people that will revisit relationships, even after the relationship has ended constantly. This was a bad relationship; it was toxic. I ended two months later, and I’m talking to them again. I want to give it another go.”

Optimization Techniques
1. Define Personal Value:
“You have to figure out what value is for you. What does money mean for you? What is your relationship with money?”
2. Individualized Approaches:
“Your diet has to be your diet. This is why you can’t just jump on a diet fad; you can’t just go to some nutritionist, and you can’t just go to some fitness influencer, especially if you have your second house or your Venus in retrograde.”
3. Use Your Talents:
“Should be using [your creative talents]. It doesn’t have to be the only thing, but you should be using it.”
4. Develop Relationship Discernment:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Learn to evaluate potential partners consciously
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Define what relationships mean to YOU
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Recognize patterns of revisiting toxic connections

How Retrograde Modifies Mars Energy
The Inward Turn of Action:
“This is why people who have a Mars retrograde turn their energy inward, and they have a very difficult time asserting themselves. They have a very difficult time taking action, starting new projects because it already was started before they were born.”
The “Already Started” Paradox:
“When you have a retrograde in your chart and the action’s already been done for you, the universe, everybody else that came before you is already done, you’re in a position of reevaluating.”
Missing Starter Energy:
“You feel like there’s a missing starter. You feel like there’s something that’s stopping you from being able to make money doing these things or being able to have a relationship…”

Rarity Note
Verbatim:
“Mars are very rare; Silas, Mars and Venus only happen every two years, so both of those are rare retrogrades.”
Mars retrograde in a natal chart is relatively uncommon, making those who have it particularly unique.
________________


Inward vs. Outward Assertion
Self-Directed Anger:
“Often, you’ll end up asserting yourself to yourself. So if there’s any anger with a partner, you could blame yourself, or you could just communicate with yourself, and it doesn’t actually fix any of the issues or any of the trauma.”
Action Within Action:
“But you can see action within action. You can do things within what you’re doing. So … because you see opportunity for doing things within something you’re already doing … Because the natural flow of a retrograde planet is to go inward, is to go backwards, is to revisit.”
________________


Strengths of Mars Retrograde
Reworking Existing Systems:
“You can take things that exist, things that have been done a certain way … you can turn that energy inward. And there’s blessings and challenges in there.”
Attraction Energy:
“Retrograde energy is an attraction energy, so you have a couple of things that are going on because it’s going back.”
Deep Focus:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Ability to rework, revise, perfect
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Seeing opportunities within existing frameworks
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Fitness, bodybuilding, writing, creative compilation work

Challenges of Mars Retrograde
Difficulty Starting:
“In the first parts of your life, these are areas that don’t seem to work. Right, there are things that you feel like you’re missing or you’re lacking. And those are things that you have to go inward to find.”
Compounding Rework:
“You just want to be careful because retrogrades compound. So as you rework things, you can get so hung up on this snow pile of reworking and redoing that it stops you from moving forward.”
Assertion Problems:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Trouble asserting needs outwardly
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Self-directed anger rather than external expression
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Feeling stuck before action begins

Optimization Techniques
1. Delegate Action:
“You have to work around it … you have to bring other people in to do the work for you. So it’s very much a delegating type of energy.”
2. Work Within What Exists:
“Work the energies within the retrograde, which means you have to realize that all that eighth house energy and Mars itself, you taking action on things is going to be through values through yourself. So when you start bringing intimacy into your own life, so you’re not asking for it; you’re not asserting it.”
3. Use Inward-Directed Activities:
“People with a Mars retrograde actually end up doing like bodybuilding or fitness, or in this case, it would be something that would be writing or a career that uses your talents, that it’s all you kind of reworking your own stuff and kind of compiling it.”
4. Recognize the Rework Pattern:

House and Sign Considerations
Example: Mars Retrograde in 2nd House, Libra (Lisa’s Chart):
Verbatim:
“Mars is retrograde in your second house. Awesome … all that Scorpio energy … it’s going to be encapsulated as a house condition into … the second house of self-worth, value … making money, your partner’s money, and you know how value attributes to how you relate to other people and so on.”
“Yours is in Libra. So it’s a non-confrontational energy anyway, but it’s, you have to work with workarounds, and you have to bring other people in to do the work for you.”
Analysis:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Mars in Libra is already challenged (non-confrontational)
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Retrograde compounds this
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Located in 2nd house affects money, self-worth, values
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Requires delegation and internal reworking before external action
________________


Aspect Considerations
Semi-Sextile Complications:
“You actually have to focus on this to resolve this issue so that this energy can feed into this one, because this can make it very difficult to put your energy into something that’s going to make money.”
Mars retrograde in aspect to other planets compounds the internal reworking quality and may create roadblocks that must be worked through in sequence.

Verbatim:
“Jupiter is expansion and abundance and philosophy and culture, right?”

How Retrograde Modifies Jupiter Energy
Absence of Expected Abundance:
“When you are looking at definitions and why I keep saying stop looking at definitions, Jupiter in the fourth house, Jupiter in … always says you had a big house. You had a big family, blah, blah, blah. I didn’t know that I had a family. … I did have a large family. I never knew them until I was 37 years old when I used astrology to go find them.”
Cultural Disconnection:
“When you are born with Jupiter retrograde … you don’t understand abundance; you don’t understand philosophy. There is culture doesn’t exist, or your relationship to culture isn’t there.”
Seeking What’s Missing:
“You’re looking for something more to learn. … You could have the whole dictionary and you’re like, it probably left out some words. Then you go to Urban Dictionary, and then you go to whatever, and you start learning all those words.”

Instructor’s Jupiter Retrograde Experience
Verbatim:
“Jupiter retrograde, Jupiter is expansion and abundance and philosophy and culture, right? It’s all these things. Guess what I don’t have and didn’t have growing up? Any of those things, no abundance, not a big family.”
Cultural Substitution:
“But I’ll tell you what I did get is all of my friends. That I’ve had growing up through all of my recreation and activities and martial arts and all of that from my childhood. I went with their family, the ruler right there, boom with their family and their family and their culture. All of my friends were ethnic, every single one. …So, but that’s the retrograde, and I dove deep into it; I took all of their, their culture to me and said, why are you doing that?”
________________


Learning and Education
Skepticism of Traditional Education:
“It’s usually like, I already know this, or college is not going to teach me anything that I can’t learn myself. You’ll hear that all the time from somebody who has a ninth house retrograde or a Jupiter retrograde.”
Forever Student:
“For me, I’m a forever student…ninth house…the ninth house is about higher education, but it’s also about teaching; you can’t teach without higher education, without a higher knowledge. …So, you’re going to limit your teaching if you’re not continuously learning.”

Strengths of Jupiter Retrograde
Seeing Hidden Opportunities:
“You see opportunity … within something that other people don’t see. And that’s what makes people with a ninth house retrograde.”

Verbatim:
“Saturn itself has to do with any authority figures.”

How Retrograde Modifies Saturn Energy
Authority Confusion:
“When it comes to authority, you think you have the authority more than other people. You don’t respect people just because they’re in a system or in a position of authority with a Saturn retrograde because you need to prove it.”
Non-Traditional Career Paths:
“Most people with a Saturn retrograde or a 10th house ruler that is retrograde are not meant to have careers in the standard traditional sense because that career has already been had. That level of achievement has already been had. … Like you don’t understand what an achievement is when you are successful at something; you are usually successful, but you don’t honor it because you don’t understand it.”
Success Blindness:
“You don’t know what success is; you don’t know what a career is; you don’t know what authority is. So you don’t like cops as much; you don’t like your boss as much.”

Instructor’s Saturn Retrograde Experience
Verbatim:
“I also have a Saturn retrograde, so I don’t verbalize mine in the third house. I don’t talk about being successful. I don’t think I’m successful. Like I talk about it all the time. I’ve got my name up on a building, I got money, I got whatever. I’ve done a lot of really cool things, but in my mind, in my energy, in my brain, I don’t attribute that to being successful. I’m not successful yet. There’s always something else, and it’s because I haven’t really—I’m still 42 years old. I haven’t figured this out yet, what success means to me.”
Rejecting Management:
 Story shared about being offered a managerial promotion and declining it because it felt like a “downgrade” despite higher pay and status.
________________


Tradition and Structure
Creating Personal Traditions:
“You create all kinds of traditions for yourself. Everything’s a freaking tradition. I always do this; you’ll hear people with Saturn retrograde be like, I always do this. … That’s a tradition.”
Natural Success Without Recognition:
“You’re naturally successful. Most people with Saturn retrogrades are, and this is also why, partly why people with Saturn retrograde or the 10th house rule or retrograde have a tough time with management and have a tough time with anybody in a position of authority where they don’t necessarily want to be the manager. They already feel like that would be a downgrade for them because you are imprinted with the energy that you’ve already had it.”

Challenges of Saturn Retrograde

Structure Confusion:
“There’s an expectation of structure, but it’s not there for you. There’s no authority there for you. Authority you don’t make, it doesn’t make any sense, but at the same time you feel like you already have the authority.”

House and Sign Considerations
Example: Saturn Retrograde in 12th House, Aquarius (Kathleen’s Chart):
Verbatim:
“So you have your Saturn in retrograde; your 10th house ruler is not, so you have a little bit of a rebrief. However, the energy still plays itself out, at least partially, in that. When it comes to authority, you think you have the authority more than other people. You don’t respect people just because they’re in a system or in a position of authority with a Saturn retrograde because you need to prove it. You need them to rework it. You need that to come to you.”

Verbatim:
“Uranus wants it to be better than the best. That’s Uranus’s energy. Aquarius is better, not best, better.”

How Retrograde Modifies Uranus Energy
Stuck in the Past:
“For people who have the 11th house ruler in retrograde or Uranus retrograde, friendships, networking, goals, like not structured goals, but like future. We get hung up on the past instead of the future when we have a Uranus retrograde. We forget that there is a future; we’re always reworking what the future could have been.”
Out-Weird Competition:
“You try to out-weird other people just to prove that you’re weirder than them.”
Endless “How”:
“You want to know how the how works, especially for yourself. … So that’s how that works, but how did that lead to that? And then you just keep going until you think you’ve understood everything, which is never.”
________________


The Improvement Trap
Verbatim:
“That is, you’re in this retrograde. It’s not really as much at you as it is about me. Like, it starts that way. Like, I can do that better. But then it’s like, I can keep doing it better.”
Instructor Example:
“Mine’s in the 11th house, or my 11th house ruler’s retrograde in the 11th house … that is why I keep fixing astrology.”
“Every time I think I’m gonna do something, I change it. Look at the book. I’ve been telling y’all for a year that I’m gonna write this freaking book, and I keep rewriting it.”

Friendships and Groups
Difficulty with Lasting Connections:
“When it comes to friends, friends are a tough one.”
Standing Out:
“Naturally speaking, a Uranus retrograde wants to stand out. They like being different; they want to be different. You being different is not different enough.”

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Set boundaries on improvement cycles
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Move to the next project
2. Channel Innovation Productively:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Focus on projects where improvement IS the goal
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Use unique perspective for breakthrough work
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Stand out in meaningful ways
3. Allow a Future:
“Let me clarify that not focusing enough on the future doesn’t mean that we’re staying in the past all the time. So maybe if I said that, I don’t mean that that’s always it. We just have a hard time with what our future is going to be.”
4. Embrace Your Weird:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Use uniqueness as strength
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Don’t compete to be “weirder”
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Be authentic rather than contrarian

 Instructor shares story of out-innovating peers, always seeking to improve and stand out.
Group Confirmation:
“How many y’all have a Uranus retrograde? 'Cause this is a, this one’s a popular one. How many y’all have a Uranus retrograde? Does this make sense to you? When it comes to networking, it feels like I don’t want to network with these people.”
“How many of you with a Uranus retrograde have fixed something—a faucet, a tire, a phone, a website? And after you’re done, you’re looking for another way to fix it again …You fix it, and you fix it, and you fix it, and you have to be careful because at some point you have lost your life trying to fix stuff.”

“Neptune has to do with the Hayes; it has to do with, um, it has to do with the spiritual; it has to do with, uh, well, like I said, not understanding, so let me start with that one.”

How Retrograde Modifies Neptune Energy
The Confusion Within Confusion:
“When, when you don’t understand something and then you, that happened before you were born and then you’re born and you’re imprinted with the, I don’t understand, but I don’t understand that I don’t understand. And that is the challenge for a Neptune retrograde.”
Deep Unconscious Layers:
“Your unconscious within your unconscious, the things that come up that you’re unaware of. It also means your intuition is much deeper than other people’s, but you don’t understand your intuition, which means you’re not attached to your intuition.”
Idealistic Vision Without Understanding:
“You don’t understand why it can’t be like that. So when it comes to your utopian values and visions, you don’t understand why in this area of life it can’t just be.”

Unique Vision:
“You’re highly creative and inspired, but your inspiration, you’re going to have a hard time connecting with being inspired until you’ve kind of connected to something that is reworking the inspiration for it.”

Challenges of Neptune Retrograde
Difficulty with Endings:
“It takes you forever to close a chapter of your life, and that can play out in a multitude of ways.”
Dream Recall Problems:
“Dream recall gets tougher with a Neptune retrograde later than it does. I only recall pieces. Yeah, that’s the haze that we’re talking about, the confusion.”
Disconnection from Inspiration:
“If you yourself are into music, you can get lost in music very easily … you can also have a very difficult time being inspired until you’ve kind of connected to something that is reworking the inspiration for it.”

House and Sign Considerations
Example: Neptune Retrograde Conjunct Uranus (Jamie’s Chart):
Verbatim:
“So Neptune, before I jump into this chart, Neptune is all about what? Illusion, spirituality, creativity, imagination, all of these things. The first thing is, when it comes to these things, you’re not aware of what is not real, so that’s the challenge. Neptune’s a really hard one to kind of explain and understand, which makes sense because Neptune is all about not understanding, so we’re going to do our best to understand this as much as we can.”

 Played in bands, major focus on harmonics and group dynamics, but unable to resolve interpersonal differences. Eventually moved on but still nostalgic.

How Retrograde Modifies Pluto Energy
Powerlessness:
“Pluto retrograde, already power and control, and things of that nature; you don’t have any. So, that’s what happens with a Pluto retrograde; you don’t have any power, you don’t have any control; you’re reworking what that means.”

“You hide yourself, and you hide within yourself layers and layers, and Pluto can all can … you can feel that, and that is your default mode; you can hide who you really are from the world.”
Always Seeking Purpose:
“Always seeking purpose … you’re always seeking that purpose. You always know you had a purpose, but you didn’t never knew what it was.”

Control and Childhood
Feeling Powerless:
“You feel powerless; you feel control, and you feel often in situations like you are powerless and that you don’t have control over things. … sharing was very difficult for you.”
Overcompensating as Parent:
 Story shared about becoming a “hover-parent” to compensate for felt lack of power/control experienced as a child.
“Everything feels out of control; everything feels like you’re powerless constantly throughout your life. And it’s because you’re supposed to figure out what power and control are.”

Challenges of Pluto Retrograde
Hiding Core Self:
“You can hide those [creative expressions, video games, hobbies] because you feel like you don’t have the power, and if you, if other people know that somehow that they can have power over you, so you just kind of keep it to yourself.”
Overcompensation Patterns:

PART III: CHART EXAMPLES & CASE STUDIES
3.1 Lisa’s Chart: Mars Retrograde in 2nd House (Libra)
Retrogrades Analyzed: Mars retrograde
Complete Interpretation:
Verbatim:
“Mars, Mars is retrograde in your second house…For you, it’s in retrograde, so essentially all that Scorpio energy that would be outward with all of this…you have all these ideas, ambitions…but you feel like there’s a missing starter…What you have to do is work the energies within the retrograde, which means you have to realize that all that eighth house energy and Mars itself, you taking action on things is going to be through values through yourself…you have to go back and revisit it and rework it to be able to make it happen.”
Key Details:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Mars retrograde in 2nd house in Libra

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Delegate system: 8th house energy funnels into 2nd house through Mars
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Libra placement = non-confrontational, needs delegation
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Struggles: self-worth, initiating money-making activities, intimacy
Instructive Value:
 Shows how Mars retrograde in cardinal/relationship-oriented sign (Libra) compounds difficulty with assertion, and how house rulership delegation works with retrogrades.
Optimization Strategy Given:
“You have to work with workarounds, and you have to bring other people in to do the work for you. So it’s very much a delegating type of energy.”
Must work on self-worth and values FIRST before Mars energy can flow into action.

3.2 Anita’s Chart: Mercury Retrograde in 1st House (Stellium)
Retrogrades Analyzed: Mercury retrograde in stellium with multiple planets
Complete Interpretation:
Verbatim:
“Anita’s chart, where’s your Mercury? Ah, in the first house. So you have a mercury that acts as an Aries, Taurus, and Libra because you have that conjunction here and Scorpio. So you have that mixture here, but it all spawns off of Scorpio and kind of feeds in…So it’s like I’m already diving deeper. This can be challenging for two reasons. Without the retrograde, it’s already challenging sometimes because again, the order matters…But the Mercury retrograde itself, yours is combined into this, so yours is, we have to break down a little bit more. Mine, for instance, is sitting at six degrees all by herself, you know, just floating up there. But yours is sitting here at the tail end of a stellium.”

3.3 Tanya’s Chart: Pluto Retrograde as 3rd House Ruler in 3rd House
Retrogrades Analyzed: Pluto (3rd house ruler) retrograde in 3rd house
Complete Interpretation:
Verbatim:
“So she has her third house ruler retrograde back in the third house. There’s going to be probably an entire webinar that I’m going to have to do just to help you guys understand a planet whose ruler’s back in the same, or a house whose ruler’s in the same house as the sign because that could be challenging. This is where order matters. …So for Tanya, she’s looking for, and the moon, I’m going to ignore the moon for a second…So there’s an intensity and a depth of what she’s looking for or logic. So anytime she would see or hear something or has a perception of something, she’s going to be like, what did I miss?..”

3.4 Kathleen’s Chart: Saturn Retrograde in 12th House (Aquarius)
Retrogrades Analyzed: Saturn retrograde in 12th house
Complete Interpretation:
Verbatim:
“So you have your Saturn in retrograde; your 10th house ruler is not, so you have a little bit of a rebrief. However, the energy still plays itself out, at least partially, in that. When it comes to authority, you think you have the authority more than other people. You don’t respect people just because they’re in a system or in a position of authority with a Saturn retrograde because you need to prove it. You need them to rework it. You need that to come to you.”

Instructive Value:
 Shows how Saturn retrograde plays out in spiritual/hidden realm (12th house) and how mutual reception with another planet (Uranus) creates complex energy flow.

3.5 Jamie’s Chart: Neptune Retrograde Conjunct Uranus (3rd House Ruler Retrograde)
Retrogrades Analyzed: Neptune retrograde conjunct Uranus; 3rd house ruler retrograde
Complete Interpretation:
Verbatim:
“So Neptune, before I jump into this chart, Neptune is all about what? Illusion, spirituality, creativity, imagination, all of these things. The first thing is, when it comes to these things, you’re not aware of what is not real, so that’s the challenge. Neptune’s a really hard one to kind of explain and understand, which makes sense because Neptune is all about not understanding, so we’re going to do our best to understand this as much as we can. …Neptune retrograde in conjunction; so there’s a Neptune retrograde conjunction here with Uranus.”

Real-Life Story:
 Jamie played guitar in bands, deeply involved in music and group harmony, but unable to resolve interpersonal differences. Eventually moved on from music but remains nostalgic. Dreams of reunion but recognizes it won’t happen.
Challenges:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Difficulty with endings (Neptune)

Instructive Value:
 Shows how Neptune retrograde manifests in artistic/musical contexts and how conjunction with Uranus compounds the “can’t move forward” quality.

3.6 Sharon’s Chart: Pluto Retrograde in 5th House (as Ruler)
Retrogrades Analyzed: Pluto retrograde, 5th house ruler
Complete Interpretation:
Verbatim:
“Pluto retrograde, fifth house ruler, and it’s with Neptune. …So, Pluto retrograde, already power and control, and things of that nature; you don’t have any. So, that’s what happens with a Pluto retrograde; you don’t have any power, you don’t have any control; you’re reworking what that means. Everything feels out of control; everything feels like you’re powerless constantly throughout your life. And it’s because you’re supposed to figure out what power and control are. And when it comes to it, the other thing I didn’t talk about with retrogrades is we overcompensate. So whenever a retrograde is in your chart, we always overcompensate to try to prove that we have that normally.”

Optimization Discussion:
 Must figure out what power and control mean personally, allow transformation, stop overcompensating.
Instructive Value:
 Shows how Pluto retrograde creates patterns of powerlessness and overcompensation, especially in creative/child-related areas (5th house).

3.7 Renata’s Chart: Chiron Retrograde Only (No Other Retrogrades)
Retrogrades Analyzed: Only Chiron retrograde
Question Asked:
“Yeah, but I don’t have anything retro, actually. I just have my Chiron, but I wanted to ask; I felt some of them. Should I check if any of my planets are in pre-grade or post-grade?”
Complete Interpretation:
Verbatim:
“Is it okay if I show your chart? …The first thing is you have your Mercury in the 12th house in Scorpio conjunct Saturn, so that’s the reason why you do it. Even though you don’t want to do it, the 12th house and Scorpio is, and its ruler here is, has to do with control and power and things of that nature, and sometimes feeling like there isn’t any. It’s not really the release and the need to reevaluate those, so that part of like the Scorpio, that part of the Saturn, it’s not about you building structure; it’s not about it coming back on.”

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * This creates similar authority issues as Saturn retrograde would
Instructive Value:
 Critical Teaching: Demonstrates that strong aspect configurations (especially with Saturn, Pluto, or outer planets) can create effects SIMILAR to retrogrades even without actual retrograde status. Also shows importance of checking pre-grade and post-grade planetary positions.

Retrogrades Analyzed: Uranus retrograde (generational)
Group Interactive Example:
Verbatim:
“How many y’all have a Uranus retrograde? 'Cause this is a, this one’s a popular one. How many y’all have a Uranus retrograde? Does this make sense to you? When it comes to networking, it feels like I don’t want to network with these people.”
“How many of you with a Uranus retrograde have fixed something—a faucet, a tire, a phone, a website? And after you’re done, you’re looking for another way to fix it again …You fix it, and you fix it, and you fix it, and you have to be careful because at some point you have lost your life trying to fix stuff.”

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Never completing projects fully
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Seeking next improvement immediately
Instructive Value:
 Shows how generational retrogrades (like Uranus) create shared patterns across age cohorts, and how to identify these patterns in groups.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * “I’ve got a ton”
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Result: Deeply inward-focused personality, delayed development in multiple areas, eventual mastery through unique self-assessment
Verbatim:
“Most of my planets are retrograde, kind of licking my lips on this one because I’m kind of proud of it, but also kind of ashamed of it.”
Renata’s Chart (Only Chiron Retrograde):
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Only one retrograde
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * BUT: Strong Saturn/12th house/Chiron aspects simulate retrograde effects
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Shows that similar issues can come from strong aspect configurations
Key Insight:
 Multiple retrogrades create compounded, recursive energy—“snow pile of reworking.” Single or no retrogrades may still experience similar themes through aspects, house placements, or planets in pre/post-grade.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Compounded, multidimensional re-examination

Key Insight:
 Retrograde planets in stelliums or conjunctions are far more complex than standalone retrogrades. Order of planets by degree matters for how energy flows and compounds.

Verbatim:
“It’s usually like, I already know this, or college is not going to teach me anything that I can’t learn myself. You’ll hear that all the time from somebody who has a ninth house retrograde or a Jupiter retrograde.”

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Rejects external authority
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Non-traditional paths
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Doesn’t recognize own success
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Creates personal traditions instead

4.4 Before/After or Contrasting Examples
Venus Retrograde - Relationship Revisiting:
“These are the type of people that will revisit relationships, even after the relationship has ended constantly. This was a bad relationship; it was toxic. I ended two months later, and I’m talking to them again. I want to give it another go.”
Jupiter Retrograde - Cultural Reconnection:
 Instructor didn’t know family or cultural roots until age 37, then used astrology to find them—late-life reconnection pattern.
Saturn Retrograde - Success Recognition:
 Instructor at 42 years old still doesn’t feel successful despite objective achievements (name on building, money, accomplishments).
Key Pattern:
 Retrogrades often manifest as:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      1. Early life: Feeling out-of-sync, lacking, or missing something
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      2. Middle life: Seeking, reworking, trying to figure out what’s missing
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      3. Later life: Potential mastery IF the person aligns with the retrograde’s unique demands

PART V: COMMON PATTERNS & THEMES
5.1 Universal Retrograde Patterns
Early Life Struggle:
“A lot of people look at retrogrades as like these huge burdening challenges, and they definitely feel that way coming up because in the first parts of your life, these are areas that don’t seem to work. Right, there are things that you’re you feel like you’re missing or you’re lacking. And those are things that you have to go inward to find.”
The Inward Journey:
“So that’s the first thing to realize, that the beginning of your life, wherever you have a retrograde, you can expect to not have that planet’s energy playing out in a normal way.”
Path to Transformation:
“So each one of these retrogrades is sitting in your chart for a reason, right? It’s part of what makes you different from the next person, and honing in and harnessing them is extremely important.”
________________


5.2 The Compounding Effect
Verbatim:
“You just want to be careful because retrogrades compound. So as you rework things, you can get so hung up on this like snow pile of reworking and redoing that it stops you from moving forward.”
Key Insight:
 Retrogrades create recursive, self-referential energy—repeatedly re-evaluating or revisiting life themes, sometimes leading to:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Inaction
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Inner agitation
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Analysis paralysis
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * “Snow pile” effect
BUT Also:
“But you can see action within action. You can do things within what you’re doing.”
The compounding can be channeled productively if conscious awareness is applied.

5.3 Inner Planet Retrogrades (Rare & Individual)
Mercury, Venus, Mars:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Much rarer than direct motion
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Heavily individualized
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Create out-of-sync thinking, relating, or action
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Strong personal signature
Verbatim:
“When it comes to inner planet retrogrades, these are less common than direct planets, at least the forward motion of it, because you have prograde, pregrade, and postgrade that are all still moving forward. You only have retrograde that goes backwards…”

5.4 Outer Planet Retrogrades (Generational)
Uranus, Neptune, Pluto:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Retrograde approximately 5-6 months per year
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Large cohorts share them
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Generational characteristics
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Still personal, but within shared context
Verbatim:
“Generational patterns: ‘Pluto…many of you guys have Pluto retrograde, Neptune, Uranus as well.’”
Example:
“This generation or this isn’t a generation, because Saturn moves relatively quickly. Every two and a half years, it switches a sign, right? But for people who were born with Saturn in Aquarius, it’s always interesting.”

5.5 The “Already Having” Phenomenon
Core Retrograde Paradox:
“Every retrograde in your chart, every single one of those planets has already hit that point before. And that energy that your natal chart is, is a cosmic snapshot that is imprinted on you at that exact moment you were born to create your natal chart, which means you are embodied or imbued with all of the energy from the moment and everything the planets were doing at that time…”
Results in:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Feeling like “I already know this”
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Sense of “I should already be able to do this”
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Confusion about why it’s not working
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Need to initiate, assert, or value newly for themselves, distinct from collective norms

5.6 Multiple Retrogrades in Same Chart
Instructor’s Experience:
“Most of my planets are retrograde, kind of licking my lips on this one because I’m kind of proud of it, but also kind of ashamed of it.”
Result:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Highly complex, deeply inward-oriented personality
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Success found through unique self-assessment rather than conformance
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Compounding effects require special awareness to avoid recursive paralysis
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Can lead to exceptional uniqueness and mastery
Warning:
“And then any energy that you work on yourself is reworking the idea of reworking the strategy. You just want to be careful because retrogrades compound.”

“So that’s the first thing to realize, that the beginning of your life, wherever you have a retrograde, you can expect to not have that planet’s energy playing out in a normal way…But you have to go inward to find.”
Frame as Unique Strength:
“So each one of these retrogrades is sitting in your chart for a reason, right? It’s part of what makes you different from the next person, and honing in and harnessing them is extremely important.”
Normalize the Challenge:
“I want you to understand why they’re not direct and how they’re different from being direct and what that can mean negatively. Because if we understand how it can be bad or potentially negative or overwhelming…How do we learn how to stop?”

6.3 What Clients Commonly Ask or Struggle With
Common Questions:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         1. “Why do I feel out of sync with this area of life?”
 Answer: Retrograde energy doesn’t work in the “normal” way; it requires inward processing first.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         2. “Why do I lack [planet’s quality]?”
 Answer: You don’t lack it; it’s turned inward and requires unique activation.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         3. “Why do I struggle to initiate/assert/value [specific theme]?”
 Answer: The action/value/structure was “already done” before you were born energetically, so you must rework it to make it yours.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         4. “Why do I feel ‘not good enough’?”

“But I always think I’m not good enough, and I’m not the only one; it’s a lot of that going around.”
Answer: Retrograde creates perpetual self-improvement drive; must learn to recognize accomplishments.

6.4 Success Stories & Breakthrough Moments
Example: Emotional Release During Session
Verbatim:
“I know that crying seems bad, but I feel amazing, so thank you. No, it’s not bad, crying is not bad. I used to think that crying was terrible because I have my sun opposite Neptune. I used to think it was the worst thing in the world…And I’ve had to learn how to accept it; it’s important. All of these energies are important. We need to be able to cry, we need to be able to be emotional, we need to be able to be processed…”
Breakthrough Recognition:
 Client realizing that their retrograde patterns are:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            * Not personal failures
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            * Sources of unique strength
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            * Requiring acceptance rather than fighting
Instructor’s Journey:
“I finally figured it out, at least partially, but it took, I’m 42 years old. Now it took me a long time to figure this out. I don’t want people to figure out 40 years later…”
Sharing personal timeline empowers clients to be patient with their own process.

6.5 Guidance on North Node vs. South Node (Related Topic)
Verbatim:
“So whenever I hear somebody say, jump into your North node and leave your South node, I’m like, no, no, don’t do that. Your South node is where half your strengths are; it comes off the moon. You’re trying to be someone you’re not; that’s never going to work out.”
“We want you to feel, I don’t want you to feel uncomfortable, but I do know that the North node there is uncomfort, discomfort, whatever, not being comfortable, it’s out of our comfort zone, but it’s also, it’s there in your chart for a reason, but it’s there for a reason, because it’s supposed to emotionally make that more comfortable for ourselves.”
Key Teaching:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            * Don’t discard South Node (default ways or strengths)
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            * Gradually widen comfort zones toward North Node
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            * Retrograde patterns require their own timing and route to integration
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            * Balance between familiar (South Node) and growth (North Node)

PART VII: INTEGRATION WITH ALCHEMISTIC CONCEPTS
7.1 Retrogrades & Aspect Spectrum
Semi-Sextile as Roadblock:
Verbatim:
“All aspects are worked backwards, but each one has a different meaning. The semi-sextile is a roadblock; it’s a feeling like it can’t happen. It’s a full stop; that’s exactly how everything feels, like a roadblock. I try, and I just feel like I get redirected all the time. Yeah, because if you’re not putting it into the next energy properly and aligning with that energy, then it will feel that way. So I start aligning with the Neptune first? Yes, Neptune and the fact that it’s retrograde as well. This conjunction, this is part of color theory.”
Key Insight:
 Retrograde planets in semi-sextile or combination aspects act as internal roadblocks whose resolution and energy flow must be worked backward—compounding retrograde effects.
Example: Lisa’s Chart
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            * Mars retrograde in semi-sextile applying to Neptune and Chiron
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            * Creates energy flow roadblock
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            * Must resolve Neptune/Chiron issues first before Mars energy can flow properly

7.2 Retrogrades & Delegates (House Rulership)
Bidirectional Energy Flow:
Verbatim:
“Also remember the rulership delegates of them, which is basically just saying that it’s coming from a house condition somewhere else. So Mars rules Aries; whatever’s going on in Aries is being pulled in, and it becomes for you, it’s the eighth house. …This is the delegates thing, it’s going to be the representative of the entire house of everything that’s going on in the eighth house, and for you, all of that goes into the second house.”
Key Teaching:
 When a retrograde planet is a house ruler, the retrograde quality affects:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            1. The planet itself
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            2. ALL themes of the house(s) it rules
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            3. Energy flow between the ruled house and the house where the planet sits
Example: Instructor’s Venus Retrograde via Rulership:
“Second house is naturally Taurus; its ruler in my chart is retrograde. Seventh house, Libra ruled by Venus; its ruler retrograde. So for me, as Venus pertains to money and as Venus pertains to relationships, I have both retrograde.”
Both 2nd house (money/self-worth) AND 7th house (relationships) are affected by Venus retrograde, even if Venus itself isn’t in those houses.

7.3 Retrogrades & House Conditions
Verbatim:
“We have to combine it with another planet, right? So if it’s like, you know, Capricorn in your third house and Saturn’s, now we’ve got two things to look at…When it’s the planet, we’re only talking about one thing, and then the ruler of the house, when it’s a house ruler, that’s retrograde. Now we’re going back to that house, and so it’s, it depends on what we’re, what we’re looking at it or how we’re looking at it.”
House Condition Formula:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            * House condition = SUM of all energies within that house
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            * If house ruler is retrograde, the ENTIRE house condition becomes “retrograde-flavored”
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            * Energy flows bidirectionally between delegate planet and house

7.4 Retrogrades & Energy Flow Order
PHSR Cycle:
 Planet → House → Sign → Ruler (and ruler takes you back to planet again)
Verbatim:
“Planet, house, sign, ruler, and ruler takes you back to planet again. So that’s the cycle. So if you have a retrograde planet, say the ninth house, but the ninth house, do you have this?..I do. …So I’m talking about these planets. The first thing I need to know is that without knowing the rulership or anything, and this is where to help you not get overwhelmed, is you look at the fact that Jupiter and everything that Jupiter means, all of it. …And then when you get into lenses…”
Retrograde Impact on Flow:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            * Retrogrades “return” the energy to earlier stages
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            * Sometimes creating recursive loops
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            * Especially when planet/ruler is retrograde and routed back to the same or previous houses
Advanced Technique:
“Order of planets to resolve energy and to understand energy flow, and how things work by saying this first, this, this, this, and then it goes this way, and being able to trace that. And there’s kind of a version called dispositorship…”

7.5 Retrogrades & Lenses
Verbatim:
“You’ve taken the foundations masterclass already, all of it. Okay, so when you get into lenses, which is obviously the theme of what we’re talking about, how does it portray to love? How does it portray to career? How does it portray to gymnastics? Whatever the theme is, right?”
Key Integration:
 Retrograde status must be considered through EVERY lens:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            * Love Lens: How does Venus retrograde affect romantic relationships?
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            * Career Lens: How does Saturn retrograde affect professional path?
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            * Money Lens: How does Venus or Jupiter retrograde affect financial abundance?
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            * Health Lens: How does Mars or 6th house ruler retrograde affect vitality?
Context-Dependent Interpretation:
 Same retrograde manifests differently depending on which lens is being applied.

7.6 Retrogrades & Reverse Vantage
Verbatim:
“Vantage is extremely important if you’re doing anything like, God, what’s it called? Derivative astrology. If you’re doing a derivative astrology and you’re trying to understand why, you know, the, the seventh house rulers in the fifth house, but I’m looking at the first child. …It’s because of vantage, you know, it’s the flow of energy as it pertains to what we’re looking at. So I’ll be teaching that later…”
Key Insight:
 Retrogrades must be tracked bi-directionally when using Reverse Vantage or derivative astrology methods. The retrograde modifies not just forward energy flow but also reverse-traced energy.
________________


7.7 Retrogrades & Dispositorship/Layering
Verbatim:
“There’s kind of a version called dispositorship, which is what layering became in my system, where it traces things, but it never goes backwards. And it always tries to find a final dispositor, like that’s the whole goal…We don’t know what happened in house five, and that’s why people are so lost, right? So that’ll obviously be another webinar.”
Alchemistic Modification:
 Traditional dispositorship doesn’t account for retrograde recursive loops. Alchemistic system’s bidirectional rulership tracking is necessary to fully understand retrograde energy flow.
________________


7.8 Retrogrades & Shared Themes (House Oppositions)
Verbatim:
“For me, I’m a forever student…ninth house…the ninth house is about higher education, but it’s also about teaching; you can’t teach without higher education, without a higher knowledge. …So, you’re going to limit your teaching if you’re not continuously learning. And that’s another thing I’ll talk about: shared themes, because we talk a lot about…”
Key Concept:
 Retrogrades are tied to the concept of shared themes/oppositions:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            * North/South Node
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            * 5th/11th house
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            * Balancing between self/other or now/future
The retrograde’s recursive inward pull affects this balance, often creating one-sided emphasis until consciously balanced.

PART VIII: ADVANCED CONCEPTS & TECHNIQUES
8.1 Pre-Grade and Post-Grade Significance
Pre-Grade (Pre-Retrograde Station)
Definition & Detection:
“For retrogrades… for pre-grade is going to be the end of retrograde. … You want to know this so that you can determine which is which is which stage.”
Critical for App Development:
“Just because there’s no R on it does not mean that it’s not giving you some of those vibes as it slows down. So each one of your planets might not show a retrograde in your chart, but in your progressions, especially if you’re young and one of your planets goes retrograde, it means that your natal planet was close to retrograde or it could have been post-grade; it could have been just after.”
Functional Impact:
 Planets within 1-2 degrees or days of retrograde station exhibit retrograde-like qualities even without the ‘R’ symbol. Must check ephemeris for exact planetary motion state.
________________


Post-Grade (Post-Retrograde Station)
Definition:
“The period of time after a retrograde, so February 24th, when this planet goes all the way back to here, anything from 17 degrees Cancer back up to six degrees Leo, where it already was before, is called post-grade.”
Quality:
 Planet moving forward again but traversing degrees already covered twice. Creates completion or integration quality—tying together lessons from retrograde period.
________________


8.2 Retrogrades in Progressions
Verbatim:
“In your progressions, especially if you’re young and one of your planets goes retrograde, it means that your natal planet was close to retrograde or it could have been post-grade; it could have been just after.”
Key Teaching:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            * Progressed retrogrades have just as much interpretive significance as natal retrogrades
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            * If natal planet goes retrograde by progression early in life, indicates natal planet was VERY close to station
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            * Timing of progressed retrogrades marks major life shifts in that planetary theme
App Implication:
 Must calculate and display progressed positions and motion states, not just natal.

8.3 Chart Relocation & Retrogrades
Verbatim:
“Chart relocation… when you relocate, for me, coming here puts my third house retrograde, and it puts my, what’s the other one? My 12th house retrograde.”
Key Insight:
 Relocating birth chart to new location can:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            * Move planets into different houses
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            * Change which house rulers are retrograde
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            * Alter life area themes affected by retrogrades
Example:
 Instructor found spirituality (12th house themes) after relocating—12th house ruler became retrograde in relocated chart, forcing inward spiritual seeking.
App Implication:
 Relocation charts must recalculate house placements and rulerships, showing how retrograde effects shift geographically.
________________


8.4 Timing Considerations: Transits
Mars Retrograde Transit Example:
“Mars, the first planet, probably the best one to start with, is going to go retrograde this year, December 6, 2024, at six degrees in the sign of Leo. This particular one is going to go backwards…”
Key Distinction:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            * Natal retrogrades: Permanent personality traits requiring life-long integration
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            * Transit retrogrades: Temporary periods (weeks to months) when collective experiences specific retrograde themes
Integration:
 When transit retrograde hits natal retrograde or natal direct planet, creates significant activation or reworking period.
________________


8.5 Retrograde Stelliums or Clusters
Anita’s Stellium Example:
“The Mercury retrograde itself, yours is combined into this, so yours is, we have to break down a little bit more. Mine, for instance, is sitting at six degrees all by herself, you know, just floating up there. But yours is sitting here at the tail end of a stellium.”
Complexity Factors:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            1. Order of planets by degree matters for activation sequence
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            2. Decans influence overall flavor
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            3. Multiple retrograde planets in stellium compound the reworking quality exponentially
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            4. Aspects within stellium create internal roadblocks or flow patterns
Advanced Analysis Required:
“I’m not going to get into this in here, but… you’ve got a lot of… half your chart is in semi-sextiles, so that’s something that you’re going to want to understand and break down.”
________________


8.6 Mutual Reception & Retrogrades
Kathleen’s Saturn-Uranus Example:
Saturn in Aquarius (Uranus-ruled sign)
Uranus rules 11th house
Creates reciprocal rulership/mutual reception
Effect:
 When one or both planets in mutual reception are retrograde, creates complex, intertwined reworking of BOTH planetary themes simultaneously.
Optimization:
 Must work on both energies together, not sequentially, because they’re mutually dependent.
________________


8.7 Overcompensation Patterns
Pluto Retrograde Overcompensation:
“And when it comes to it, the other thing I didn’t talk about with retrogrades is we overcompensate. So whenever a retrograde is in your chart, we always overcompensate to try to prove that we have that normally.”
Examples:

Recognition & Correction:
 Clients must be made aware of overcompensation tendency so they can moderate it consciously.

PART IX: COMMON MISTAKES & CORRECTIONS
9.1 What People Get Wrong About Retrogrades
Mistake #1: Retrogrades Are Only Negative
Correction:
“A lot of people look at retrogrades as like these huge burdening challenges, and they definitely feel that way coming up because in the first parts of your life, these are areas that don’t seem to work. Right, there are things that you’re you feel like you’re missing or you’re lacking. And those are things that you have to go inward to find.”
“I know I’m focusing kind of on the negative side of it, and I don’t want you to think that retrogrades are negative; they absolutely aren’t.”
Retrogrades are sources of uniqueness and potential mastery, not just problems.
________________


Mistake #2: Only Planets With ‘R’ Are Affected
Correction:
“Just because there’s no R on it does not mean that it’s not giving you some of those vibes as it slows down.”
Must check for pre-grade and post-grade positions, which mirror retrograde qualities.
________________


Mistake #3: Cookbook Definitions Apply Universally
Correction:
“When you are looking at definitions and why I keep saying stop looking at definitions, Jupiter in the fourth house, Jupiter in … always says you had a big house. You had a big family, blah, blah, blah. I didn’t know that I had a family.”
Must attend to delegation flow, energy context, aspectual nuance, and individual chart complexity.
________________


Mistake #4: One-Size-Fits-All Interpretations
Correction:
“The challenge with labeling one thing as the one thing has been another source of contention within astrology. As you learn that relationships are the seventh house, it’s like, well, relationships are a theme. Love is a theme. Your interaction with other people is definitely the seventh house, but it is not your whole relationship. You have to break that down.”
Retrograde interpretation must be context-dependent and multi-layered.
________________


Mistake #5: Ignoring Technical Accuracy
Correction:
“If you learn them as conjunct, that’s challenging when it’s really not conjunct. This is why I harp so much on accuracy and learning the details and whatnot because a conjunction and a separation within the same energy does not work the same.”
Must check:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            * Exact orbs
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            * Applying vs. separating aspects
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            * Degree-by-degree order
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            * House cusps and boundaries
________________


Mistake #6: Overlooking Relocation & Progressions
Correction:
“Chart relocation… when you relocate, for me, coming here puts my third house retrograde, and it puts my, what’s the other one? My 12th house retrograde.”
“In your progressions, especially if you’re young and one of your planets goes retrograde, it means that your natal planet was close to retrograde…”
Must calculate and interpret relocated AND progressed charts, not just natal.
________________


Mistake #7: Assuming Retrogrades Always Stay in Past
Correction:
“Let me clarify that not focusing enough on the future doesn’t mean that we’re staying in the past all the time. So maybe if I said that, I don’t mean that that’s always it. We just have a hard time with what our future is going to be.”
Retrogrades don’t trap people in the past; they make future visioning more challenging and require conscious effort to project forward.

9.2 Pop Astrology Misconceptions to Debunk
Pop Astrology Error #1:
 “Mercury retrograde ruins everything.”
Alchemistic Truth:
 Natal Mercury retrograde creates unique logic, deep analytical ability, and revolutionary thinking—not chaos.
________________


Pop Astrology Error #2:
 “Retrogrades mean you’re cursed or broken.”
Alchemistic Truth:
“Your retrograde is one of those things that says, I’m not the same. It’s kind of like Chiron in in its way… that’s a part of your authenticity.”
Retrogrades are markers of individuality and authenticity.
________________


Pop Astrology Error #3:
 “You should avoid your retrograde themes.”
Alchemistic Truth:
“So each one of these retrogrades is sitting in your chart for a reason, right? It’s part of what makes you different from the next person, and honing in and harnessing them is extremely important.”
You should optimize and harness retrograde themes, not avoid them.

9.3 How to Avoid Misinterpretation
Best Practice #1: Always Check Ephemeris
“You also want to kind of take a look at the ephemeris at the time you were born to understand what your planet’s really doing because your planet might not be retrograde, but it could have been two days before retrograde…”
Best Practice #2: Trace Energy Flow
 Use PHSR (Planet-House-Sign-Ruler) cycle and bidirectional rulership to understand full impact.
Best Practice #3: Consider All Factors
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            * House placement
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            * Sign placement
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            * Aspects
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            * Rulerships
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            * Decans
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            * Order by degree
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            * Pre/post-grade status
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            * Progressions
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            * Relocation
Best Practice #4: Balance Themes
“Every planet is pro and con, positive, negative. I want to balance out the good, and I want to make sure that the bad is subdued, right, as much as we can…”
Never present only challenges or only strengths—always both.
Best Practice #5: Avoid Assumptions
“Do not assume you know what’s in a document. …You have to be careful of that [with Mercury retrograde].”
Check every detail; don’t rely on memory or assumptions.

10.4 Conditional Logic for Retrograde Interpretation
Decision Tree Structure:
1. Check Motion State:
IF planet has 'R' symbol:
   → Use full retrograde interpretation
ELSE IF planet within 2 degrees of retrograde station:
   → Use pre-grade interpretation (partial retrograde qualities)
ELSE IF planet recently stationed direct and within shadow zone:
   → Use post-grade interpretation (integration phase)
ELSE:
   → Use direct/prograde interpretation


2. Check House Rulership:
IF retrograde planet is house ruler:
   → Apply retrograde interpretation to:
      a) Planet itself
      b) ALL themes of ruled house(s)
      c) Energy flow between ruled house and planet's location
   → Display delegation path visually


3. Check for Stellium/Cluster:
IF retrograde planet is part of stellium (3+ planets within 10 degrees):
   → Flag as "Complex - Stellium Involvement"
   → Note that interpretation must account for:
      a) Order of planets by degree
      b) Decan ruler
      c) Multiple aspects within cluster
   → Suggest advanced consultation


4. Check Aspects:
IF retrograde planet in semi-sextile:
   → Note: "Energy flow roadblock - must work aspects backward"
IF retrograde planet in mutual reception:
   → Note: "Intertwined reworking of both planetary themes"
IF retrograde planet in square/opposition:
   → Note: "External challenge compounds internal rework"


5. Check Progressions:
IF natal planet progresses to retrograde within first 30 years of life:
   → Flag as "Close to Station - Enhanced Retrograde Qualities"
   → Display progressed retrograde timing


6. Apply Lens Context:
WHEN user selects specific lens (Love, Career, Money, Health, etc.):
   → Modify interpretation text to emphasize relevant themes
   EXAMPLE:
      Venus retrograde + Love Lens → Focus on relationship revisiting patterns
      Venus retrograde + Money Lens → Focus on self-worth and earning challenges

Chiron Retrograde Webinar (Future)


“We won’t be talking about that today; we’ll do a different webinar for Chiron, which will include Chiron retrograde in that one.”


                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              2. House Ruler in Same House Webinar (Future)


“There’s going to be probably an entire webinar that I’m going to have to do just to help you guys understand a planet whose ruler’s back in the same, or a house whose ruler’s in the same house as the sign because that could be challenging.”


                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              3. Advanced Aspects Course (Planned)


“My next course, I’m going back to houses, planets, and signs, but then I’m getting into aspects very quickly. I’m going to blow your mind with how those aspects actually work because that’s the thing that most of y’all are missing: aspects, aspects, and transits.”


                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              4. Shared Themes & Oppositions (Future)


“And that’s another thing I’ll talk about: shared themes, because we talk a lot about…”


                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              5. Dispositorship/Layering Deep Dive (Future)


“We don’t know what happened in house five, and that’s why people are so lost, right? So that’ll obviously be another webinar.”

PART XII: CLOSING SUMMARY & KEY TAKEAWAYS
12.1 Main Points to Remember
1. Retrogrades Are NOT Negative
 They are sources of uniqueness, authenticity, and potential mastery—not burdens or curses.
2. Early Life vs. Later Life
 Retrogrades feel missing or non-functional early in life, requiring inward journey to discover and integrate.
3. The “Already Done” Paradox
 Retrograde planets carry the energy of “already having been there,” creating need to rework and make the energy personally yours.
4. Inward vs. Outward
 Retrograde energy flows inward first, requiring internal processing before external expression.
5. Compounding Effect
 Retrogrades create recursive loops—“snow pile of reworking”—that must be managed consciously to avoid paralysis.
6. Uniqueness Marker
“Your retrograde is one of those things that says, I’m not the same.”
7. Optimization Requires Alignment
“This does not act direct, so I have to understand that it acts this way. And once I align with that, I will become powerful and things will work much better for me.”
8. House Rulership Delegation
 When retrograde planet rules houses, the retrograde quality affects ENTIRE house themes, not just the planet.
9. Pre-Grade & Post-Grade Matter
 Planets close to retrograde station exhibit retrograde qualities even without ‘R’ symbol.
10. Context Is Everything
 Same retrograde manifests differently through different lenses, aspects, houses, and signs.
________________


12.2 Most Important Optimization Principles
1. Go Inward to Find
“These are things that you have to go inward to find.”
2. Work WITH the Retrograde, Not Against It
 Trying to force direct behavior creates more struggle. Align with the inward, reworking nature.
3. Delegate or Use Workarounds
 Especially with Mars retrograde—bring others in to initiate, then rework from there.
4. Define Personal Standards
 Don’t compare to external/societal definitions (especially Saturn, Jupiter, Venus retrogrades).
5. Recognize Compounding
 Be aware when reworking becomes excessive; set boundaries on revision cycles.
6. Balance Pros and Cons
“I want to balance out the good, and I want to make sure that the bad is subdued, right, as much as we can…”
7. Accept the Timeline
“I’m 42 years old. Now it took me a long time to figure this out.”
Retrograde integration takes time; be patient with self and clients.
8. Use Unique Perspective
 Your retrograde-driven difference IS your advantage—lean into it.
9. Allow Transformation
 Especially with Pluto retrograde—periodic death/rebirth is necessary and healing.
10. Seek Support
“I know that crying seems bad, but I feel amazing, so thank you.”
Emotional processing, therapy, and community support are essential.

12.5 Final Thoughts & Encouragement
Instructor’s Closing Words:
“When you look at other people’s charts, have a better idea of how these retrogrades play out. And more importantly, be able to assess the pros and cons so that you can say, okay, well, this is how this works. This is how it will always work, progressions aside, so we need to work with this. So when you’re dealing with a client, you’re talking to your family members, you’re looking at your own chart and you’re like, okay, this does not act direct, so I have to understand that it acts this way. And once I align with that, I will become powerful and things will work much better for me.”
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         1. Your Difference Is Your Power
“Your retrograde is one of those things that says, I’m not the same… that’s a part of your authenticity.”

TRANSCRIPT 16: ACCEPTING CHIRON WEBINAR
Complete Knowledge Extraction for Alchemistic Astrology App Development
Class Date: January 26, 2025
Word Count: ~26,500 words
Critical Framework: “Accepting” vs. “Embracing” — acceptance is the core challenge with Chiron
________________


PART I: FOUNDATIONAL CONCEPTS & CLASS PURPOSE

The Deliberate Choice of Language:
Verbatim:
“Welcome to the Accepting Chiron. … the purpose of why I called it, I keep saying embracing Chiron, because I did a Lilith one, which is embracing Lilith, and yes, embracing is extremely important. But with Chiron, I really chose the word accepting because that is the biggest difficulty; it’s the biggest strife that we have when it comes to this astrological body or astronomical body.”
Key Distinction:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         * Embracing (Lilith): Can be actively claimed, projected outward, owned as power
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         * Accepting (Chiron): Requires surrender to what cannot be “fixed,” normalized, or made to conform
The Core Challenge:
“And the fact that in this area of life, stuff just don’t go right and it’s not supposed to. And that’s the acceptance part, is that in this area of life, you are unique, you are different, you are special, and things are chaotic and just off axis, so to speak here.”

1.2 How Chiron Fits Into Alchemistic Astrology
Central to Self-Acceptance Work:
Verbatim:
“And for those of you who are here learning alchemistic astrology, you know that for me, when I was putting all this together, when I was looking at everything, the astronomical doctrine of signatures is extremely important.”
“I use (Chiron) in almost every single astrology reading now in tandem with the Lilith placement to really help people accept who they are.”
Chiron as Authenticity Marker:
“Chiron is the key; Chiron’s the key to everything in your life. It is what makes you, you, because you’re in process of figuring out the better way to do it, but no one else is gonna be in the same place as you. So therefore, it’s the most authentic planet you have.”
________________


1.3 Debunking the “Wounded Healer” Myth
Pop Astrology’s Main Error:
Verbatim:
“So if I type in astrology, it’s always going to be, Chiron is the wounded healer. I’m going to tell you right now that that is not true. Chiron is not the wounded healer in the sense that in the mythology, Chiron was, you know, one of centaurs within this, this mini scourge in that, you know, wasn’t even a part of it, but ended up getting inadvertently shot in the leg with a poison arrow. Eventually, over time, couldn’t heal himself, but supposedly could heal everybody else. And then had to go to Zeus, gave up his immortality for, I think, Prometheus, and then ended up mortal and then died. Like that’s the story.”
The Truth:
“I don’t understand how people are trying to apply that to the real world, how they’re trying to apply that to life because literally nothing I just said has anything to do with your Chiron placement. The closest we get to wounded healer is that Chiron does represent what we perceive as weaknesses and wounds.”
Better Framework:
“The healer part, you know, is not based specifically on the wound itself as much as the fact of, of where the orbit path is… Jupiter’s not so much about healing as much as it is about wisdom. … So again, calling Chiron the wounded healer is, in terms of articulation, is just off. If we want to get to what’s valid about it, it is wounds that we are able to mentor, and it’s based off of our own perception of these things and our own beliefs around these things and what we’ve had to accept as our own truth, which is Saturn.”
________________


PART II: ASTRONOMICAL & MYTHOLOGICAL BACKGROUND
2.1 Chiron’s Astronomical Classification
Centaur Object:
Verbatim:
“I pulled up this image specifically because I wanted you to see a couple of things. This is a rendering; this is obviously not an actual photo. We don’t have a true photo yet of Chiron. It was discovered in 1977, so our information on this asteroid, on this centaur, is very limited. Now, centaurs in mythology, half person, half horse, whatever; and because it’s a centaur, all of the centaurs in astronomy were labeled after mythological centaurs.”
Hybrid Nature:
“Centaur … hybrid physiology, so to speak, of comets and asteroids, which means many of them actually have a, um, a cloud glow that they call a halo…Chiron’s halo. Pull it up real quick, coma. … Chiron, you don’t have a standardized coma because, although there is water and ice, they believe that it is actually carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide that is creating the coma there, but it still operates because it has an orbit as an asteroid, so it has that hybrid feature.”
________________


2.2 The Unstable Orbit & Its Meaning
Location Between Saturn and Uranus:
Verbatim:
“Anything that sits between Saturn and Uranus, there’s a very specific sector of the, uh, the universe. They call that the Centaur range and it’s highly unstable. … Saturn’s gravitational pull, Uranus, Uranus’ gravitational pull, and the mechanics of that area, is that it’s highly unstable. … the orbit changes. The orbit fluctuates; it has not been the same for the last million years, and over the next million years.”
Astrological Interpretation:
“For you to accept Chiron and bring that into your life, that it’s about malleability. It is about molding. It is about realizing that there is no concrete structure here.”
________________


2.3 Physical Properties & Their Symbolic Meaning
Unknown Axial Tilt:
Verbatim:
“We do not know its axial tilt because we have not gotten a clear image. We don’t actually understand its rotational period. We know its rotational period, but it’s off of light spectrum. …which means we don’t know what side is up and what side is down. …we haven’t determined its axial tilt because we haven’t determined its axis.”
Irregular Shape:
“It is just an irregular shape in general, … it’s not a perfect sphere or even a bulbous sphere. … 220 kilometers, 136 miles. So it’s one of the largest centaurs, which is why it impacts us. But when you compare it to a planet, it’s not even close.”
Chiron Has Rings:
“One thing that’s super interesting … is this: there are rings too; there are rings to Chyron. …Chyron acts like its own system. It acts like there are other space dust, debris, and rocks and things that are actually orbiting this comet asteroid.”
Astrological Significance:
“It doesn’t have its own place in the universe where it’s consistent. And this lends to exactly what Chyron is in your chart. … it is always changing. It is invariable, and it is its own presence. It is its own system, which lends to you needing to understand it and realize that it is a significant astronomical and astrological position in your chart.”
________________


2.4 Orbit Path: Between Structure (Saturn) and Revolution (Uranus)
Visual Description:
Verbatim:
“Orbit path of Chiron: So red is Jupiter, yellow is Saturn, and green is Uranus. Purple is Chiron. … it crosses Saturn and it goes all the way up, but it doesn’t quite reach Uranus.”
The Crucial Insight:
“Chiron’s orbit, along with everything about its physical properties, has to do with the fact that it crosses over Saturn. So, Saturn becomes a prominent theme, but it comes within Saturn, closer to Jupiter, which is going to bring in Jupiter themes. … it comes all the way out and we get almost to Uranus’s path, and this is important, the fact that it doesn’t actually reach Uranus because when you look at a natal chart, zodiac signs…”
Breaking Down But Not Reaching Revolution:
“When Chiron comes over to, but does not, oops, does not reach Uranus, that means Chiron in your chart is a place where structures have been broken down. Structures are not solid; they are on their path to be broken down until they would reach the Uranian point where there’s pride and a brand new perspective, where we’ve seen things differently We’ve taken the structure, we turned it on its head, and we said, no, this is better because Capricorn and Saturn’s energy is best; it is achievement, success. I’m the best at what I do. And Uranian energy comes along and says, I can do it better, and it breaks everything down. … Chiron’s energy doesn’t get there, so Chiron’s energy is in the process of breaking things down, and for several reasons, this is a weakness; so what ends up happening is you don’t feel strong in this area.”

PART III: CORE CHIRON DEFINITION
3.1 What Chiron Represents
Primary Themes:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         1. Area of Perceived Weakness:
“Chiron does represent what we perceive as weaknesses and wounds. And there is an element of true weakness here. And this is that we have to talk about here because you have to accept it, understand it, and do your best to support yourself around this, this placement and this configuration in your chart, because there is a weakness there; however, that weakness can be turned into strength.”
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         2. Malleability & Lack of Structure:
“For you to accept Chiron and bring that into your life, that it’s about malleability. It is about molding. It is about realizing that there is no concrete structure here.”
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         3. In-Between State:
“Chiron’s energy doesn’t get there, so Chiron’s energy is in the process of breaking things down… you don’t feel strong in this area.”
________________


3.2 The Lego Metaphor
Perfect Visualization:
Verbatim:
“It’s kind of like you built something with Legos; I like to go back to Legos all the time. You built something with Legos, and you start taking the pieces apart to create the next thing that you think would be better, but you haven’t built it yet. So, some of the pieces are missing, some of the pieces are sitting off to the side, and some of the pieces you put in this bucket over here, and you still have access to them, but they’re not part of the main structure anymore.”
The Vulnerability:
 Things can happen that make you “open to weakness” because the structure is dismantled, pieces scattered, new vision not yet realized.
________________


3.3 The “I Don’t Like” Framework
Universal Chiron Pattern:
Verbatim:
“So, when you look at Chiron in your chart, the first thing you say, I don’t like. I don’t like authority traditionally. I don’t like networking and friendships traditionally or social media traditionally. In third house, I don’t like communication or the expectations of communication traditionally. I don’t like facts, figures, numbers, or math traditionally. I don’t like early education traditionally, the way they teach traditionally. I don’t like money or value traditionally. I don’t like what I’m supposed to do traditionally. I don’t like my body. The way that it’s supposed to be traditionally.”
Core Principle:
 Wherever Chiron is, there is discomfort with expectations and traditional structures in that life area.
________________


3.4 The Authority Paradox
You Already HAVE the Authority:
Verbatim:
“You feel, with like Chiron and Gemini or Chiron and Aquarius, you feel that you’re not smart because you don’t have the structure of being smart. … But for you, it’s like I don’t do it like everybody else. …But in the perception of everybody else, you are smart, like you’re beyond smart. How did you figure that out? … And this is the part of Chiron that no one talks about, and I think is one of the most important things. You already have the authority. You already know how this works, but you’re breaking it down.”
The Insecurity:
“Now, because you’re breaking it down and you’re in the process of re-figuring it out, there is a weakness.”
________________


3.5 Comparison to Saturn (The Default Trap)
Why Chiron Hurts:
Verbatim:
“The acceptance part is that you don’t get to go back. Chiron’s orbit is sitting; most of it is sitting as a centaur out towards Uranus. You don’t get to choose to be structured in this area and be like everybody else, be traditional and all this attorney and properties; you don’t get to. You’ve moved beyond it. You’re beyond tradition; you’re beyond authority; you’re beyond structure, but you’re not rebellious. You don’t have the confidence, and this is where the insecurity is because you default back to the biggest planet there is, which is Saturn.”
The Comparison Cycle:
“So you compare yourself to other people; you compare yourself to people who have been successful; you compare yourself to what’s normal…You default to that because that’s what you naturally do when you’re insecure.”
“All of that is Saturnian. You default to that because that’s what you naturally do when you’re insecure. You overcompensate because the majority of people that you’re comparing to are Saturnian.”
________________


PART IV: THE ACCEPTANCE CHALLENGE
4.1 Why Chiron is SO Difficult to Accept
It Defies “Normal”:
Verbatim:
“With Chiron, I really chose the word accepting because that is the biggest difficulty; it’s the biggest strife that we have when it comes to this astrological body or astronomical body.”
“In this area of life, stuff just don’t go right and it’s not supposed to.”
The Expectation Problem:
“When you allow it to, through expectation, which is another Saturnian theme, when you have expectations here, there becomes a problem.”
________________


4.2 What Happens When Chiron Is NOT Accepted
Overcompensation:
Verbatim (from instructor’s experience):
“Sometimes I buy it just to prove I can buy it, which is the overcompensation because when I was young, I didn’t have any money, I didn’t have any authority, I didn’t have any respect, I didn’t have any parents, and this is how it played out at first.”
Loss of Authenticity:
“Chiron is just as delicate and difficult to deal with; the authority is already there. But when I try to be the authority, because I’m taking Chiron’s energy and pushing it back to Saturn’s level, I’m no longer, I’m no longer being authentic. And I’m not expressing that energy the way that it’s supposed to.”
Emotional Consequences:
“When I allow Chiron to get the better of me, it’s like this little rage that points up, like, fuck you. That’s literally how it comes out: get the fuck out of here.”
“It directly crushes my mood and it makes me angry.”
________________


4.3 The Path to Acceptance
Step-by-Step Process:
Verbatim:
“You have to accept that Chiron where it sits, the Chironics itself, and accept everything that is step one. Step two is the house. What area of life is this happening to you? Step three is the sign in the deck, and then step four is all the aspects. And then step five is where’s that ruler. What is it feeding itself into? And then you go from there until layering.”
What Acceptance Looks Like:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         1. Acknowledging the Difference:
“Accepting Chiron is to say that traditionally, like in the first house, traditionally speaking, my body and my motivations and my, even the way that I have sex and what, how my stuff works is going to be different.”
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         2. Stopping Comparison:
“You have to accept that I know something that is revolutionary, that is going to change the structure of things… but I can’t force it.”
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         3. Embracing Authentic Expression:
“When I allow myself to say, I already know how to do what I want to do. I already know what I want to do deep down, and I allow myself to do the things I want to do in the way that I want to do them.”
________________


PART V: CHIRON BY HOUSE (COMPLETE BREAKDOWN)
Interpretive Framework:
Verbatim:
“The houses are far more important than the signs; the signs flavor it. The house tells you exactly what it is on a personal level. The Zodiac signs are more like a lens to the universe.”
________________


5.1 CHIRON IN THE 1ST HOUSE
Core Wound Theme:
Verbatim:
“Chiron in the First House is that you, it’s not that you don’t have the authority. Remember, Chiron says you do have the authority. You just feel like when you’ve exceeded beyond that point, you’re supposed to pull yourself back. So, you don’t like the expectations around maintaining the physical body. You wouldn’t like expectations around you’re supposed to do something.”
Early Life Experience:
“It’s likely when you were younger that you were always told to go do something, figure out your life, go whatever. And it created this wound because you didn’t know what you wanted to do, because you looked to everybody else and the expectations there. And maybe you’ve tried a bunch of things, and things just don’t seem to work out for you because you haven’t allowed yourself to say, I already know how to do what I want to do.”
The Pattern:
“People with Chiron in the first house have a very difficult time because they constantly feel like they have to prove themselves to everybody. I can do this; I hate it. Go cut your nails. You need a haircut. I’m like, no, I don’t; I’m fine.”
Acceptance Challenge:
 Must accept that their physical body, motivations, and self-direction are inherently non-traditional.
Path to Healing:
“Until you do that, it won’t happen.”
Allow authentic self-expression without proving anything to anyone.
________________


5.2 CHIRON IN THE 2ND HOUSE
Core Wound Theme:
Verbatim:
“If Chiron’s in the Second House or in relation to Venus, they don’t like the expectations around money; they don’t like the systems around money. And there’s a different way that they see value in money that would be a bit more revolutionary, a bit more potentially even more humanitarian, but it would be a new way to use money, a new way to use resources. But they tend to have self-worth issues because there’s a certain level of expectation they feel like they’re supposed to have over themselves and their values, and their talents, and their art. And these people are usually highly artistic, but they don’t see it.”
Real-Life Manifestation:
“I buy games and never finish them. … sometimes I buy it just to prove I can buy it, which is the overcompensation because when I was young, I didn’t have any money, I didn’t have any authority, I didn’t have any respect, I didn’t have any parents, and this is how it played out at first.”
The Gift:
 Highly artistic, revolutionary approach to value and resources, but cannot recognize own talents.
Acceptance Challenge:
 Accept non-traditional relationship with money, value, and self-worth.
________________


5.3 CHIRON IN THE 3RD HOUSE
Core Wound Theme:
Verbatim:
“In third house, I don’t like communication or the expectations of communication traditionally. I don’t like facts, figures, numbers, or math traditionally. I don’t like early education traditionally, the way they teach traditionally.”
Communication Style:
 Difficulty expressing thoughts in expected ways; may need unique methods of translation.
Example from Silas:
“When we would like read books in class, I can’t look at the book and listen to what the other people are saying at the same time…When I’m watching a movie, I can’t watch the movie without subtitles or else I don’t understand the concepts, what they’re saying.”
Acceptance Challenge:
 Accept unique learning and communication style; stop trying to fit traditional educational molds.
________________


5.4 CHIRON IN THE 4TH HOUSE
Core Wound Theme:
Verbatim (inferred from system):
“It’s not my authority and how I process and perceive emotion, or how I relate to emotion, or my mother, or my family. It is that, you know, that there’s an element of it being different there that does not conform to tradition or expectation. It’s already been broken down, and it’s perceived as a weakness because we don’t know what to do with it.”
Specific Example:
“Because yours goes back into cancer, mom specifically.”
Area Wounded: Family, emotional foundation, mother, home life.
Manifestation: Unconventional family structure or emotional processing; difficulty with maternal expectations.
________________


5.5 CHIRON IN THE 5TH HOUSE
Core Wound Theme:
Verbatim:
“When it’s with the sun, Fifth House, Fifth House ruler, Leo Energies, it’s not that you don’t like yourself; it’s that the expectations that you feel like you’re supposed to be something. You already know who you are, but you don’t feel like you’re comfortable enough to express that in public with your individuality. So therefore, you tend to overcompensate by either overly expressing yourself or shutting yourself down, or you try to chameleon, almost like a Pisces. You try to chameleon to fit the expectations of others, and therefore you’re never truly yourself, and you end up usually unhappy, unfulfilled and have a difficult time through comparison with trying to figure out what you want to be.”
Area Wounded: Self-expression, creativity, joy, individuality, romance.
Pattern: Chameleoning to fit others’ expectations, over/under-performing, never feeling fully authentic.
Acceptance Challenge: Accept authentic creative expression without reference to others.
________________


5.6 CHIRON IN THE 6TH HOUSE
Core Wound Theme:
Verbatim:
“If it’s in your sixth house, it’s like, I don’t like routine. My health is already good, but in some cases, it’s broken down. So there are certain things that are going to cause health issues for me that it’s like, I almost have an allergy to something because…mental health works a certain way.”
Area Wounded: Daily routine, health, work, service.
Manifestation: Aversion to routine, unpredictable health patterns, unique mental health needs.
Acceptance Challenge: Accept that rigid routines don’t work; create flexible, adaptive systems.
________________


5.7 CHIRON IN THE 7TH HOUSE
Core Wound Theme:
Verbatim:
“When it’s in the seventh house, it’s how you relate to other people. I don’t, I already know how to connect to other people, but I don’t like the expectation that I have to reply to you. I don’t like the expectation that our relationship has to be traditional or contingent on certain parameters. And therefore, the way that I see relationships and connecting to other people is a bit more independent. I can be myself and I need that a little bit of that freedom, but not to the point where I’m like separate from you. But I also feel like I’m not supposed to have that, so I feel insecure. And when someone else has their independence, I’m like, I don’t know if you’re being independent of me in a way that is a bit too much and you’re not bringing me the reciprocation that I need.”
Aesthetic Overcompensation:
“Some people with Chiron Seventh go a little too far with makeup because they have already mastered being pretty, or being aesthetic, or being able to use aesthetics, but then they take it to that next level. And sometimes it’s a good thing and sometimes it’s not; it depends on how that person has accepted Chiron.”
Area Wounded: Relationships, partnership, social connection.
Challenge: Balancing independence and connection; rejecting traditional relationship structures.

5.8 CHIRON IN THE 8TH HOUSE
Core Wound Theme:
Verbatim:
“If Chiron is in your eighth house, well, there’s intimacy issues because there’s an expectation of that intimacy and diving deeper, and you don’t like it. I don’t like that. We have to dive deeper. If I dive deeper, it needs to be on my terms in a different way. But it can also around the reproductive system not work properly, so in order to have children, that could be the same thing with the fifth house in a different way. You might not be able to have children in a normal way, and sometimes it means, you know, IVF or, you know, someone else being involved.”
Physical Manifestation:
“It depends on how it sits in your chart Or sometimes it just means, in order for you to do that and find that intimacy, to be able to have fun in a romantic connection with somebody else. There are certain ways that you have to do it for other people. It’s like low motility. If it’s Uranian involved, it might require the science or it might require, you know, something else that is going to allow you to actually have children. So you’re seeing a physical manifestation of something that is energetic, that is sitting as a broken down post-Saturn type of influence.”
Area Wounded: Intimacy, sexuality, transformation, shared resources, reproduction.
Example Response: “Eighth house themes, holy crap, that’s accurate.”
________________


5.9 CHIRON IN THE 9TH HOUSE
Core Wound Theme:
Verbatim:
“A lot of people who have Chiron in the ninth house, one of two things usually happens, or three, I guess. One is they don’t go to college. It depends on how it sits in your chart, but they don’t go to college because philosophy, higher education, expanding the mind, it’s like they’ve already kind of understood that. And what they will do, no one can teach them. So when it gets, like I said, you already have authority in this area. And this is the thing that nobody realizes. They just see Chiron, and they just say, oh, I’m broken. And there is an element of brokenness, but you already have authority, which is the challenge with Chiron. But because you’ve gone beyond that authority into something that’s a bit more revolutionary, without the confidence of being that, you default back to feeling like it’s wrong.”
Cultural Disconnection (Silas’s Chart):
“So, culturally speaking, you’re not traditional. Whatever you identify as culturally, whether that’s ethnically, or the area you live in, or whatever culture means for you, which can also include religion and just belief patterns in general of your vicinity, your family, because of cancer’s integration into the ninth house, that needs to apply into your identity in a way where you feel comfortable that you’ve revolutionized your own identity. You’re just not always going to be comfortable with it until you accept it, which means your way of thinking and your ideas are going to be different, especially than your families, because yours goes back into cancer, mom specifically.”
Area Wounded: Higher education, philosophy, belief systems, culture, travel.
Pattern: Rejecting formal education, feeling “unteachable,” seeking unique worldview.
________________


5.10 CHIRON IN THE 10TH HOUSE
Core Wound Theme (Instructor’s Placement):
Verbatim:
“Chiron in Capricorn, right? It’s expressed through Taurus, but my Chiron is in Capricorn. So it is, Chiron itself is, I already have the authority, but I’m breaking down authority into something that is what I would perceive much more future-oriented; something that’s gonna be a bit more, you know, involves networking, involves people on a bit more of a friendly level, is going to allow for a new way of doing it, but it’s gonna pertain directly to authority and structures.”
The Completion Problem:
“So when it comes to systems, when it comes to authority, when it comes to getting things done and completing things, my weakness is that I don’t complete things because, if I don’t feel that I’m supposed to complete that thing, I won’t.”
Rejecting Authority Titles:
“Part of the reason why I feel like, why I haven’t finished this damn book, even though I wrote 80 to 85% of it a year and a half ago, is because of this. It’s because I don’t consider myself the authority over astrology. I’m just a guy who fiddled with astrology because I wanted to see if I could make it work. And I don’t like the fact that it’s even called a system because I’m not an astrologer; I don’t like titles.”
The Paradox:
“Other people can just walk up and be like, I am the authority of astrology. There are people out there who do that, and I can’t do it; it’ll never work. So I have to approach it as like, look, this is what I’ve created, it is different. And I, at the same time, have to accept the fact that I am never going to be able to say I’m the authority. I can’t; I don’t want to be either.”
Area Wounded: Authority, career, public achievement, power structures.
Justin Timberlake Example:
“If you’ve ever watched any of the behind-the-scenes…he was kind of the leader of the group, even if, you know, he himself said he wasn’t the best singer…He also couldn’t do the trills and stuff, which is that Virgo Deccan. So, he ended up, through his music coach, switching to falsetto.”
Creating own signature style (falsetto) when traditional method (belting high notes) didn’t work.
________________


5.11 CHIRON IN THE 11TH HOUSE
Core Wound Theme (Ashley’s Example):
Verbatim:
“Ashley has her Chiron and Gemini in the 11th house; she actually has her Chiron in Aquarius. This has to do with the mechanics of things; this has to do with science and technology, and science has to be a certain way for her to care about it. She already gets that science is real. Like when she teaches alchemistic herbalism, science is a big part of it, but she’s like, the science isn’t enough. We need a revolution in science; that’s the same thing as saying Chiron in Aquarius. It’s like I already have the authority around rebellious things. She already knows she’s a rebel, but she’s not confident in being a normal rebel because a normal rebel just says I fixed it. I’ve done it. And she’s like I know that I’m rebellious. I already know that I look at the mechanics of things and the new way to see things, but there’s more. There’s something else. There’s more. I want to be revolutionary in being a rebel, so that’s what the 11th house creates that friction.”
Group Dynamics:
“So what ends up happening in groups and teams is that you don’t fit in with groups and teams because you’re better than them. You are better than the people who are better That’s not supposed to be cocky, but you don’t see it; you’re the friend who is the better friend.”
Area Wounded: Groups, friendships, social causes, networks, future vision.
Pattern: Not fitting into groups, being “the better friend,” needing revolution within rebellion itself.
________________


5.12 CHIRON IN THE 12TH HOUSE
Core Wound Theme (Instructor’s North Node/12th House Experience):
Verbatim:
“North node sitting in the 12th house and that Pisces energy with its ruler over here, squaring off, means I’m highly sensitive to, um, you know, to people who are. The fact that I’m rebellious kind of also creates a situation where I don’t feel like I have the authority over things. So it’s like I’ve been an isolated loner for most of my life because I feel like I see the world in a different way.”
Isolation & Spirituality:
“And especially here in California, where my entire chart shifts, and it really highlights that Piscean energy. It’s like, it’s just better when I kind of do things on my own. Most people in Hollywood didn’t even know I had a studio until they worked on a project or until I showed up on their thing, like, who’s this guy? Most people didn’t know who I was, but they knew I knew what I was doing.”
Area Wounded: Unconscious patterns, spirituality, isolation, hidden life, collective sensitivity.
Pattern: Loner tendencies, operating behind the scenes, unique spiritual path outside consensus reality.
________________


PART VI: CHIRON BY SIGN
General Framework:
Verbatim:
“Chiron by sign … The house tells you exactly what it is on a personal level. The Zodiac signs are more like a lens to the universe. So, when we are factoring this together, this is the part of acceptance that you have to understand: this area of life is not a problem. This area of life is under acceptance, an area of life that you are aware of the structure, and you have moved beyond it.”
________________


6.1 CHIRON IN CAPRICORN
Authority & Structure Wound:
Verbatim:
“Chiron in Capricorn, right? It’s expressed through Taurus, but my Chiron is in Capricorn. So it is, Chiron itself is, I already have the authority, but I’m breaking down authority into something that is what I would perceive much more future-oriented.”
“So when it comes to systems, when it comes to authority, when it comes to getting things done and completing things, my weakness is that I don’t complete things because, if I don’t feel that I’m supposed to complete that thing, I won’t.”
The Challenge: Already has authority but can’t claim it traditionally; must create new structures.
________________


6.2 CHIRON IN GEMINI
Thought & Communication Wound:
Verbatim:
“Chiron in Gemini has to do with your thought practices, your ideas, your identity. And then, depending on where it sits, this is the problem with the Chiron and Gemini thing: you’re not talking about the house, and the house is more important than the fact that it’s in Gemini. Gemini is just the way the brain’s working.”
Sharon’s Example:
“Chiron, Gemini, Mercury in the ninth can’t explain why I do and don’t like something; it just is. It’s because you have gone beyond the expectation, and you’re seeking something different, but it’s being broken down…”
The Challenge: Difficulty explaining thought processes; unique logic that doesn’t fit standard communication.
________________


6.3 CHIRON IN AQUARIUS
Revolutionary Rebel Wound:
Verbatim (Ashley):
“She actually has her Chiron in Aquarius. This has to do with the mechanics of things; this has to do with science and technology, and science has to be a certain way for her to care about it. She already gets that science is real. Like when she teaches alchemistic herbalism, science is a big part of it, but she’s like, the science isn’t enough. We need a revolution in science; that’s the same thing as saying Chiron in Aquarius.”
The Paradox:
“It’s like I already have the authority around rebellious things. She already knows she’s a rebel, but she’s not confident in being a normal rebel because a normal rebel just says I fixed it. I’ve done it. And she’s like I know that I’m rebellious. I already know that I look at the mechanics of things and the new way to see things, but there’s more. There’s something else. There’s more. I want to be revolutionary in being a rebel.”
The Challenge: Already rebellious, but seeking revolution WITHIN rebellion; never satisfied with standard innovation.

PART VII: INSTRUCTOR’S PERSONAL CHIRON JOURNEY
7.1 Placement Details
Verbatim:
“Chiron placement at 24 degrees, 42 arc minutes is in a direct, it forms a yacht here, but it’s in a direct quincunx to Pluto and from Neptune. And then we also have a square from the moon to Chiron here, and then its ruler is forming a square to my ascendant.”
Summary: Chiron in 10th house, Capricorn, with major aspects to Pluto (quincunx), Neptune (quincunx), Moon (square), and ruler Venus square ASC.
________________


7.2 Personal Stories
Childhood Martial Arts Tournament:
Verbatim:
“My dad dropped me off, and I said, why aren’t you coming in? He said, I don’t need to see you win anymore. How many times do I have to see you win, which hurt me? It was a wound, which leads directly into this. … I ended up doing bo staff … I made the whole [routine] up as I was going. … I won first place. … And I, I had a trend that every tournament I may, I went to in forms being structure, right? … I always made up my own form, and then I would make up what it was called. … I do worse when I study for a test; I just go in and go, yeah, same thing: tests, exams. I’ve never studied for a test in my life.”
Gift-Giving Wound:
“It’s not that I feel bad if I can’t give one back; I mean, that’s not true. I do feel bad if I can’t give one back, but that’s probably because of the square from the moon coming off of my 12th house, because it squares off with this. But yeah, I don’t like the expectation of gift giving…”
Financial Overcompensation:
“I’ve had 300 games when I had my, my music studio. I bought over 300 games, and I’ve done this like four or five times in my life. I’ve got all these games, and they’re all still wrapped. I’ve never played any of them. I buy them, and this is the problem, is that for me, cause it’s tied into Venus. It’s like, sometimes I buy it just to prove I can buy it.”
________________


7.3 Path to Acceptance
Current Relationship:
Verbatim:
“I have to accept that I am never going to be able to say I’m the authority. I can’t; I don’t want to be either. So therefore, I don’t want people coming to me asking me every single question about authority. I want people to learn it, which is where the mentor part comes in.”
“It’s like, I know a lot of things, and then it’s like, well, am I the authority in any of them? No, but I don’t want to be. I don’t consider myself the authority, but other people see me as such, so you have to accept that Chiron where it sits, the Chironics itself, and accept everything that is step one.”

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         * Accepting others’ recognition without claiming title
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         * Focusing on mentorship rather than authority
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         * Recognizing wins when not trying to prove anything

PART VIII: CHIRON ASPECTS & CHART INTEGRATION
8.1 How to Read Chiron with Aspects
General Principle:
Verbatim:
“Chiron with aspect, so for instance, again in my chart, you’re going to read Chiron with aspects the same way you’d read any planet with aspects. So you’re going to trace it around to see what else is there.”
Orb Note:
“Chiron’s orb is just a half degree to a degree; usually, Chiron’s affected by other planets more than it affects anything else.”
________________


8.2 Chiron-Pluto Aspects
Instructor’s Quincunx:
Verbatim:
“For instance, Chiron in the 10th house …is in a quincunx to Pluto; Pluto’s in retrograde. This is a lot to break down…And then, but it’s also the thing I’m supposed to identify with. So what ends up happening is that Chiron naturally feeds into, as it pertains to structure, finishing things, whatever. This is why, by the way, I don’t finish things unless I’m emotionally connected to them, is because Pluto rules my fourth house.”
Effect: Links authority wound to deep emotional/family identity; can’t complete things without emotional investment.
________________


8.3 Chiron-Moon Aspects
Square in Instructor’s Chart:
Verbatim:
“We also have a square from the moon to Chiron here… when you allow it to manifest in its normal way that it becomes a problem. …When I honor the 12th side, when I honor my more behind-the-scenes, when I honor my, you know, the tribe that I have, when I honor my personal spirituality and I feed that into my Chiron in a positive way, the way you use a square aspect, then Chiron is completely supported.”
Negative Expression:
“Chiron’s influence up here, feeling like I know what I’m doing, but I’m doing it my own way type of energy, and that I’m not necessarily feeling like I’m the best at it, fuels directly into my identity on a very personal level. And so, therefore, that anytime that I’m feeling insecure and not really accepting and honoring Chiron, it directly crushes my mood and it makes me angry.”
________________


8.4 Chiron Conjunct Lilith
Double Wounding:
Verbatim:
“If Chiron is conjunct to Lilith, there is a kind of a double whammy with this one because there are already insecurities that are now tied into guilt and shame. …with Chiron conjunct Lilith, it’s the same thing, but now you’re bringing in a level of insecurity to your own shame. So once you embrace and the order matters, is it Lilith and Chiron or Chiron then Lilith, we would have to dissect that…”
Key Point: Order matters—which planet comes first by degree determines primary expression.
________________


8.5 Chiron & House Rulers
Delegation Through Rulership:
Verbatim:
“Venus ruling gifts and gift giving, with Chiron there, and not just because Chiron’s there, but Chiron’s ruler is Venus. So remember, through delegates, this doesn’t just act like first, second; it acts like the whole damn thing.”
Critical Instruction:
“Step five is where’s that ruler. What is it feeding itself into? And then you go from there until layering.”
________________


PART IX: PARTICIPANT CHART EXAMPLES
9.1 Silas: Chiron in 9th House (Capricorn)
Complete Reading Process:
Verbatim (extensive exchange):
“So, Silas, when it is in Capricorn, you’re taking the themes of, I don’t like and I’ve moved beyond, and I’m still figuring it out, so I don’t have the confidence here; but things don’t work normal, and I don’t like mad facts; it’s actually a liar, liar. I don’t like this area of life as it’s expected of me.”
Sensory Processing Struggle:
“When we would like read books in class, I can’t look at the book and listen to what the other people are saying at the same time…When I’m watching a movie, I can’t watch the movie without subtitles or else I don’t understand the concepts, what they’re saying.”
Instructor’s Guidance:
“You have to allow yourself to say it the way that you feel it intuitively that leads into needing translation… So, taste a lollipop and then try to explain it to me in a way that is just natural for you to say it. Obviously, the first thing to be like, I didn’t like it. That’s fine because you haven’t found the words, but … what it reminds me of would be the best way for you to say it.”
Cultural Wound:
“So, culturally speaking, you’re not traditional. Whatever you identify as culturally, whether that’s ethnically, or the area you live in, or whatever culture means for you… your way of thinking and your ideas are going to be different, especially than your families, because yours goes back into cancer, mom specifically.”
________________


9.2 Sharon: Chiron in Gemini, Mercury in 9th
Brief Analysis:
Verbatim:
“Chiron, Gemini, Mercury in the ninth can’t explain why I do and don’t like something; it just is. It’s because you have gone beyond the expectation, and you’re seeking something different, but it’s being broken down…”
________________


9.3 Carly: Chiron in 8th House
Confirmation:
Verbatim:
“Eighth house themes, holy crap, that’s accurate. That’s the point, right, Carly?”
Issues with intimacy, transformation, depth—all confirmed.
________________


9.4 Ashley: Chiron in Aquarius/11th House
Revolutionary Science:
Verbatim:
“Ashley has her Chiron and Gemini in the 11th house; she actually has her Chiron in Aquarius. This has to do with the mechanics of things; this has to do with science and technology, and science has to be a certain way for her to care about it. She already gets that science is real. Like when she teaches alchemistic herbalism, science is a big part of it, but she’s like, the science isn’t enough. We need a revolution in science.”
Better Friend Pattern:
“You’re the friend who is the better friend.”
________________


PART X: STEPWISE INTERPRETATION METHOD
10.1 The Building Block Approach
Critical Framework:
Verbatim:
“You can’t make any inference of over what Chiron in the 10th means without factoring everything else in. So we have to use it as that building block. We start with, okay, Chiron, what does Chiron mean? And this is what a lot of people are skipping, right? And I see it all over social media, but even within alchemistic astrology, and you guys, I’ve seen it where it’s like we’ll take the moon in the seventh house, right? And you’ll just dive right in. Some of you guys are diving right into the house, which is great, but you’re forgetting to define the moon. So you’re jumping right into the second step, but you haven’t actually analyzed the first step yet.”
________________


10.2 The 5-Step Process
Step 1: Define CHIRON Itself
Verbatim:
“What does Chiron mean? It means that there’s gonna be an element of mentorship; there’s gonna be element of things going weird, different. There’s literally gonna be the theme of, I don’t like.”
Core Themes:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         * Malleability

Step 2: Identify the HOUSE
Verbatim:
“Step two is the house. What area of life is this happening to you?”
Key Point: House is MORE important than sign.
“The houses are far more important than the signs; the signs flavor it. The house tells you exactly what it is on a personal level.”
________________


Step 3: Consider the SIGN & Decan
Verbatim:
“Step three is the sign in the deck.”
Note: Signs provide the “lens” or flavor, but don’t override house meaning.
________________


Step 4: Analyze All ASPECTS
Verbatim:
“And then step four is all the aspects.”
Remember: Chiron is usually affected BY other planets more than it affects them.
“Chiron’s orb is just a half degree to a degree; usually, Chiron’s affected by other planets more than it affects anything else.”
________________


Step 5: Find the RULER & Energy Flow
Verbatim:
“And then step five is where’s that ruler. What is it feeding itself into? And then you go from there until layering.”
Key Principle: Through delegates, Chiron’s ruler connects the wound to other life areas.

PART XI: CLIENT WORK & PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS
11.1 How to Introduce Chiron to Clients
Start with Acceptance, Not Healing:
Verbatim:
“Accepting Chiron is extremely important; it’s not about fixing Chiron. And this is why I hate the term, the wounded healer. You’re not wounded…Chiron is a gift in the fact that you are literally authentic in this area. So, when you do something, when it’s your talents, when it is your wherever Chiron is, people know it’s you.”
Use the “I Don’t Like” Framework:
“So, when you look at Chiron in your chart, the first thing you say, I don’t like. I don’t like authority traditionally…”

Comparison to Others:
“You default to that because that’s what you naturally do when you’re insecure.”

Feeling Broken:
“They just see Chiron, and they just say, oh, I’m broken. And there is an element of brokenness, but you already have authority, which is the challenge with Chiron.”
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         4. Expecting to Be “Normal”:
 Clients resist accepting their difference, trying to force traditional structures.

11.4 Breakthrough Techniques
1. Real-Life Examples:
 Use relatable stories (Justin Timberlake’s falsetto) to show how accepting Chiron creates success.
2. Validate Unique Experience:
“Does Justin Timberlake stop singing because he can’t hit those high notes by belting, or does he sing in falsetto to hit those same notes? And therefore creates his own way, and therefore is known for it.”
3. Show the Gift:
“Chiron is a gift in the fact that you are literally authentic in this area.”
4. Stepwise Breakdown:
 Walk through the 5-step process to show exactHOW the wound operates and where acceptance is needed.

PART XII: ADVANCED CONCEPTS
12.1 Chiron Return (Around Age 50)
Mentioned Briefly:
Verbatim:
“Because 1977 is not that long ago, 50 plus, somewhere around 50 years, it hasn’t even been the Chiron return of the founding of the Chiron, so that’ll be something interesting. We should probably pull up at some point as the electional chart of when Chiron was discovered and we’re coming up right on that.”
Note: Chiron’s orbital period is approximately 50 years. At age ~50, Chiron returns to its natal position, marking major acceptance milestone.
________________


12.2 Chiron in Relocated Charts
Instructor’s Experience:
Verbatim:
“And especially here in California, where my entire chart shifts, and it really highlights that Piscean energy. It’s like, it’s just better when I kind of do things on my own.”
Key Point: Relocation can change Chiron’s house placement, altering how the wound manifests in daily life.
________________


12.3 Chiron Retrograde
Brief Mention:
Verbatim (Pluto retrograde in aspect to Chiron):
“Pluto’s in retrograde. This is a lot to break down…”
Note: Chiron retrograde was not given extensive coverage in this webinar, but instructor notes it adds complexity requiring careful breakdown.
________________


12.4 Other Centaur Bodies
Future Content:
Verbatim:
“These are extremely important, and I’m going to have a bunch of centaur classes on these because even those had to be really reworked into what they actually are… There are certain other comets / asteroids that are called centaurs out there, like Nessus and Phallus.”
________________


PART XIII: INTEGRATION WITH ALCHEMISTIC CONCEPTS
13.1 Chiron & PHSR (Planet-House-Sign-Ruler)
Verbatim:
“A lot of you guys, most of you know that it’s Planet House Sign Ruler, but you’re not actually reading that. So like even in the gift thing, you guys weren’t reading Planet House Sign Ruler. You guys were blurring all the energies together to try to come up with some sort of answer, and we have to take it one thing at a time as a building block.”
Application to Chiron:
 Must define Chiron’s core themes FIRST, then house, then sign, then ruler, then aspects—in that exact order.
________________


13.2 Chiron & Delegates (Transcript 13)
Verbatim:
“Venus ruling gifts and gift giving, with Chiron there, and not just because Chiron’s there, but Chiron’s ruler is Venus. So remember, through delegates, this doesn’t just act like first, second; it acts like the whole damn thing.”
Key Integration: When Chiron’s ruler delegates to another house, the wound affects THAT life area too.
________________


13.3 Chiron & Lenses (Transcript 14)
Verbatim:
“The Zodiac signs are more like a lens to the universe.”
Application: Chiron’s sign acts as the “lens” through which the wound is viewed, but house placement is primary.
________________


13.4 Chiron & Aspect Spectrum (Transcript 10)
Aspect Orbs:
“Chiron’s orb is just a half degree to a degree.”
Reading Aspects:
 Square, quincunx, conjunction all modify how Chiron’s wound manifests. Must analyze each aspect individually as “building blocks.”
________________


13.5 Chiron & Retrogrades (Transcript 12)
Mentioned in Passing:
 Retrograde planets aspecting Chiron (like Pluto retrograde in instructor’s chart) add layers of internal reworking to the wound.

PART XIV: APP DEVELOPMENT SPECIFICATIONS
14.1 Visual Display
The Key Glyph:
Verbatim:
“You look at the Chiron glyph, which looks like a key or spelled with a K. Chiron’s also spelled with a K, but this is it, and I love the fact that this ended up being the glyph because Chiron is the key; Chiron’s the key to everything in your life.”

14.4 Conditional Logic
Priority Hierarchy:
1. IF Chiron exists in chart:
   → Display prominently


2. Check HOUSE placement:
   → Load house-specific wound description
   → This is PRIMARY interpretation


3. Check SIGN placement:
   → Add sign flavor as OVERLAY
   → Do NOT override house meaning


4. Check RULER:
   → Identify where ruler is located
   → Note energy delegation path
   → Show visual connection


5. Check ASPECTS:
   → For each aspect, add interpretive layer
   → Note if Chiron is affected BY planet (common)
   → Or if Chiron affects planet (rare)


6. Check for SPECIAL CASES:
   → IF conjunct Lilith: Add "double wound" warning
   → IF conjunct Node: Note life-path significance
   → IF in fusion cusp: Display dual-house interpretation
   → IF retrograde: Add introspective layer


7. Check PROGRESSIONS (if module exists):
   → Calculate if Chiron will station retrograde by progression
   → Note Chiron return timing (~age 50)

CRITICAL: Ethical Warnings
Display before showing Chiron interpretation:
“⚠️ Chiron represents an area of deep authenticity and potential sensitivity in your chart. This interpretation describes where you may feel different or face unique challenges. Remember: this is NOT a flaw to fix, but an area requiring acceptance and self-compassion. Support resources are available if needed.”

PART XV: Q&A HIGHLIGHTS
15.1 Key Questions Answered
Q: “What if your Chiron is in Capricorn?”
A: (See full interpretation in Instructor’s Personal Journey section—themes of authority, completion, structure broken down but not rebuilt.)
________________


Q: “Is there anything that supports Chiron?”
A:
“When I honor the 12th side, when I honor my more behind-the-scenes, when I honor my, you know, the tribe that I have, when I honor my personal spirituality and I feed that into my Chiron in a positive way, the way you use a square aspect, then Chiron is completely supported.”
Key: Supporting energies from other planets (especially through harmonious aspects) can help acceptance.
________________


Q: “If Chiron is conjunct to Lilith…”
A:
“There is a kind of a double whammy with this one because there are already insecurities that are now tied into guilt and shame. …the order matters, is it Lilith and Chiron or Chiron then Lilith.”
________________


Q: “If I have Chiron and the north node in the 11th house…”
A: Must look at full chart context, but generally indicates life path (North Node) tied to acceptance of group/social uniqueness (Chiron 11th house).

PART XVI: CLOSING SUMMARY & KEY TAKEAWAYS
16.1 Main Points to Remember
1. Acceptance, Not Healing:
“Accepting Chiron is extremely important; it’s not about fixing Chiron.”
2. Chiron is Authenticity:
“Chiron is a gift in the fact that you are literally authentic in this area.”
3. The “Already Have Authority” Paradox:
“You already have the authority. You already know how this works, but you’re breaking it down.”
4. Comparison is the Enemy:
“You default back to the biggest planet there is, which is Saturn. So you compare yourself to other people.”
5. House is Priority:
“The houses are far more important than the signs.”
6. Use the 5-Step Process:
 Planet → House → Sign → Aspects → Ruler
7. It Will Always Be Different:
“You will never not be that. So the question is, is this an insecurity? Is this going to hold you back or is this going to be your strength?”
________________


16.2 Final Encouragement
The Falsetto Principle:
Verbatim:
“Does Justin Timberlake stop singing because he can’t hit those high notes by belting, or does he sing in falsetto to hit those same notes? And therefore creates his own way, and therefore is known for it. I just want to love you, baby. You know who that is.”
Core Message:
 Accept your unique way. Don’t stop doing what you love because you can’t do it the “normal” way. Create your own signature approach.

PART XVII: ADDITIONAL NOTES FROM USER
17.1 Uber Newbie Basics Corrections
From User Notes:
“Gemini doesn’t represent mirror or interaction. I see you say between 2 thoughts but it’s about how you process thought itself. Mercury doesn’t rule movement. The glyph has a reason it’s shaped the way it is but that’s not the theme of the energy. Useful to others—maybe. But it just needs to make sense for you.”
Application to Chiron: When Chiron is in Gemini or 3rd house, it’s about THOUGHT PROCESSING being unique, not just communication.
________________


17.2 North/South Declination
From User Notes:
“N is North (future), S is South (past)—this is Declination alignment. It shows where that energy is directed and whether you can bring it to the present moment.”
Note: Not deeply explored in Chiron webinar, but relevant for advanced chart analysis.

17.3 Asteroids Not Yet Taught
From User Notes:
“I have not taught these asteroids yet—they are in my book though. I spoke about them briefly because they were brought up in the Q&A today but not ready to formally teach them.”
Mentioned: Nessus, Pholus (other Centaur objects)

TRANSCRIPT 17: TAMING & EMBRACING BLACK MOON LILITH WEBINAR
Harvard-Level Knowledge Extraction for Alchemistic Astrology App Development
Date: December 18, 2024
Topic: Black Moon Lilith - Repression, Authenticity, Radical Self-Acceptance
Word Count: ~24,000 words
Instructor: Logan (Alchemistic Astrology System)

PART 1: INTRODUCTION AND WEBINAR PURPOSE
Opening Framework
The instructor opens the webinar with explicit emphasis: “Along with Chiron, I think this is one of the most important points in your chart.” Unlike Chiron (which focuses on wounds and healing), Lilith addresses repression, limitations, and suppression of authentic self-expression.
Core Problem Statement (Verbatim):
“It creates these limitations of keeping you down, keeping you repressed, keeping you from doing things that would be organically true to yourself. And when we don’t use it, or we ignore it, or we don’t understand it, or if we let it manifest in its normal, you know, what do you call it? Potential state rather than kinetic, which would be you interjecting your free will. When we let it manifest in its normal state, we don’t feel very connected to things that feel true to us, and we feel like we’re just kind of going through the motions of things.”
The webinar’s purpose is to:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 1. Correct widespread dismissal of Lilith in astrology
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 2.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 4.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 6. Demonstrate app development specifications for ethical, accurate implementation

PART 2: ASTRONOMICAL BACKGROUND AND TECHNICAL DEFINITIONS
Three Versions of Black Moon Lilith
The instructor identifies three main calculation methods, but only two are valid for Alchemistic Astrology:
1. Mean Black Moon Lilith:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 * Definition: “Mean means average, right? It doesn’t mean mean; however, it does mean mean. So, it’s the word M-E-A-N, because it’s the average.”
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 * Calculation: Uses the “smooth route” of the Moon’s elliptical orbit around Earth, averaging out gravitational fluctuations
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 * Astronomical Position: “Gives us a very non-specific but averaged out rounded point that is the average focal area of Lilith”
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 * Interpretation: Internalized, consistent, thematic energy
2. Osculating (True) Black Moon Lilith:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 * Definition: “The other name for black moon Lilith osculating is true lunar apogee”
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 * Calculation: Factors in gravitational pull from Earth, Sun, Jupiter, and Moon itself to account for the Moon’s actual non-uniform orbit
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 * Astronomical Position: “Very precise positioning of where Lilith truly is; if you factor everything else”
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 * Interpretation: External, acute, visceral, “no filter” reactions
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 * Software Code: H13 in Astro.com and Swiss Ephemeris
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 * Chart Symbol: LILO (when displayed in chart)
3. Interpolated Lilith (NOT RECOMMENDED):
“You have the Priapus, which is interpolated, and we have Lilith, which is interpolated. We don’t want either of these two because an interpolated Lilith or an interpreted Priapus… These two are basically averages between osculating and mean. And it’s, I haven’t found any validity for these, so I don’t use them.”
Astronomical Reality: The Lunar Apogee
Lilith is not a physical body but a geometric point in space:
Elliptical Orbit Mechanics:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 * The Moon orbits Earth in an ellipse (not a circle)
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 * Lunar Perigee: Closest point to Earth
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 * Lunar Apogee: Farthest point from Earth (this is Lilith)
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 * Empty Focus: The second focal point of the ellipse (geometrically necessary but with no gravitational body)
The “Invisible Mirror” Concept:
“Now, alchemistic astrology, we call this the invisible mirror. The reason we do that is because this energy, this line, which is a geometric line, is a mathematical fixation. It’s not derived on the earth, but the moon does revolve around the earth. So when we calculate a point, geometrically speaking, off of the moon, we have to reflect it back onto the earth. But we’re coming from a place that is not earthly; it is not grounded. It has nothing to do with anything we’re trying to do in the world. It is something that is completely distanced from all mankind, all humanity, and all things that are earth-like.”
Key Distinction:
 Mean and osculating Lilith can be “almost 12 degrees away from each other” in the same chart, meaning they can occupy different houses and even different signs.

PART 3: CORE PSYCHOLOGICAL THEMES
Primary Themes of Black Moon Lilith
1. Repression and Internalized Limitation:
“It creates these limitations of keeping you down, keeping you repressed, keeping you from doing things that would be organically true to yourself.”
2. Suppression of Authenticity:
 People feel they are “not allowed to do things that would be organically true,” leading to disconnection from their true self.
3. Shame and Guilt (Mean Lilith Specialty):
“Mean Lilith is an internalized, remember it’s an average of energies. So this energy is internal, it’s more consistent and it’s thematic. You feel it inside; other people don’t know anything about this one. Other people don’t know why you feel guilt, why you feel shame, why you feel isolated, why you feel like you can’t do certain things, why you feel like certain things are not allowed. They don’t know that; only you know this.”
4. Othering and Outcast Feelings:
“You’re going to feel othered. You’re going to feel outcasted in this area… if you actually pay attention to mean Lilith, nobody told you that you weren’t allowed to do this. Nobody said that. Nobody said you can’t do this. It’s just that when you express yourself in that way, you get a reaction from other people, and it’s not, sometimes it’s verbal, but it’s usually not. It’s usually a feeling.”
5. Radical Self-Acceptance as Solution:
“Lilith represents in both forms radical self-acceptance. The problem is that we are so trained and indoctrinated by social norms, conventional upbringing, all of these things that happen in the world, how other people do it, that nobody allows other people to be themselves. And the radical self-acceptance means true self. This is really you. Where’s your Lilith? That’s you.”
Mean vs. Osculating Lilith: Functional Differences
MEAN LILITH (Internalized):

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 * Quote: “Other people are not making you feel that way; you’re making yourself feel that way.”
OSCULATING/TRUE LILITH (External/Visceral):
“Osculating Lilith, this is the one you feel the most and you don’t realize it… it is like it’s not Pluto, like rage boiling up from the under the surface. It’s like very quick, like FU energy that comes out… And it triggers that like raw, emotional, visceral response that feels like, ah, maybe I shouldn’t have said that kind of energy.”

However, there’s an unmatched and unparalleled… power in it.”
RETROGRADE OSCULATING LILITH:
“Oscillating retrograde Lilith is everything that osculating Lilith is, but redirected back on yourself, so instead of getting upset at other people, the frustration comes up, and then you redirect that back at yourself. I’m mad at myself. I should have done this. Why didn’t I do this? That’s what the retrograde comes in. That’s very difficult; however, what it does for you positively, it allows you to reflect on these things.”
Important: Mean Lilith cannot be retrograde—only osculating/true Lilith can have retrograde motion.

Integration Point:
“In my opinion, along with Chiron, I think this is one of the most important points in your chart because it doesn’t share the exact thing; it really doesn’t share any of the themes of Chiron unless it’s linked to it. But it shares a very similar presence in your chart, I think, where it creates these limitations of keeping you down, keeping you repressed.”

PART 5: POTENTIAL STATE VS. KINETIC STATE FRAMEWORK
The Free Will Question
Potential State (Default/Unconscious):
“When we don’t use it, or we ignore it, or we don’t understand it, or if we let it manifest in its normal, you know, what do you call it? Potential state rather than kinetic, which would be you interjecting your free will. When we let it manifest in its normal state, we don’t feel very connected to things that feel true to us, and we feel like we’re just kind of going through the motions of things.”
Consequences of Potential State:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 * End up in jobs you hate (“nine to fives we don’t want to be in”)
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 * Stay in toxic relationships (“taking abuse from people”)
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 * Don’t advocate for yourself
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 * Feel disconnected from authentic desires
Kinetic State (Active/Conscious):
“Unless you say, ‘No, I’m gonna stand in my power; I’m gonna exert my free will; I’m gonna work with you, planet, but I’m not gonna let you tell me what to do.’ If you don’t do that actively, then you’re human… you’re just a human that’s interacting and letting everything just kind of go and flow.”
The Illusion of Free Will
Instructor’s Philosophy (Verbatim):
“A lot of us think we have free will; we think we made choices. There is an illusion of free will that’s in there. A lot of times we think we’ve made choices. I always tell you, if I’m able to guess what you did by looking at your chart, you didn’t actually exert free will. Now, if you were able to do something different— and it does happen every once in a while— if you got a list telling plants, listen, bitch, are we doing this now? Yes, Tanya. If I’m doing a reading for you or someone else, another alchemistic astrologer is doing a reading and it’s within the same energy, but it’s not the expected outcome; that’s free will.”
Application to Lilith:
 True free will is measured by whether you act outside raw chart indicators—using planetary energy with intent rather than being directed by it or repressing it.

PART 6: MYTHOLOGICAL FRAMEWORK AND SYMBOLISM
The Lilith Story (Hebrew/Babylonian Mythology)
Core Myth:
“Even if you take Lilith as a story, she was not subservient. Under no condition was she not going to be special or at least equal, because there’s an element of that as well. So she was like, instead of feeling oppressed, I’m going to feel liberated. I’ll go out and do my own thing. The problem with her, she went so far into that that if you follow the mythology a little too far, she gets crazy and becomes a nut job. And Lilith is our crazy. That’s the other thing.”
Mythological Themes:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 1. Refusal of submission (first woman, not subservient to Adam)
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 2. Choice of exile over conformity
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 3. Self-assertion at the cost of belonging
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 4. Shadow side: Going too far into self-absorption or reaction
The Cage and Leash Metaphor
Core Teaching:
“I used to say a long time ago if you wanna use Lilith properly, you have to let her out of the cage, but not let her off of the leash. Now, if you let her off of the leash, you think about the moon being further away; there’s this moment in a pattern like this, in an elliptical orbit here, where you have to imagine if the moon had feelings and the moon was a person, and it was sitting there, and it had to keep going in orbit around as a satellite around the earth, and it’s getting to the furthest point. It’s like there’s this feeling of I could just let go right now. I could let go, and I could drift off into the ether of space, and I would have no responsibility. I would have no connection to anybody. I would have nothing that would require me to do anything…”
Interpretation:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 * Out of the cage: Don’t repress Lilith (leads to illness/shadow)
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 * Not off the leash: Don’t indulge every impulse uncritically (leads to alienation/chaos)
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 * Balance: Express authentically while maintaining connection to reality and others
Application:
“We have to make sure that we don’t go so far as to alienate all their people, alienate society, alienate ourselves from reality. We still have to find a way to use all of our energies and not Lilith by herself to do the things we need to do to take care of the things we need to take care of and to live a happy life that we want to live.”

PART 7: INTERPRETATION METHODOLOGY
Step-by-Step Framework
1. Determine Both Positions:
 Use software to calculate both mean (average) and osculating (H13, true) Lilith positions.
2. Assess Degree Separation:
“For me, what this means is that how true Lilith expresses itself is going to be in one area of life, and how mean Lilith expresses itself is somewhat in the other area of life.”
When they’re far apart (different houses/signs), themes operate in separate life areas.
3. Determine Energy Flow Order:
“Now we know that at 29 degrees right here, this is in the fusion cusp area. So this actually blends from the fifth house into the sixth. When we talk about it, we’re going to talk about which one’s first, which one’s second. Remember, in alchemistic astrology, order of planets, the exact placement, the way the energy flows in terms of zodiacally, or, you know, whether it’s applying or separating, which one came first, which one has to be resolved, which one’s causing the friction; super important stuff…”
Lesser degree comes first and drives energy flow.
4. Check Retrograde Status:
 Only osculating Lilith can be retrograde. If retrograde, energy redirects inward (self-blame, self-reflection).
5. Examine Aspects:
 Check aspects to:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 * Vitality anchors: Ascendant, Descendant, Midheaven, IC/Subheaven
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 * Luminaries: Sun and Moon
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 * Nodes: North/South Node
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 * Chiron: Wound interplay
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 * Delegates: Ruling planets of houses
6. Consider Fusion Cusp:
 When Lilith straddles house boundaries (within 1-2 degrees of cusp), themes blend between both houses.
7. Maternal Connection:
“Remember all of these are also tied into mother as well. Uh-huh, so these elements of guilt and shame are things that you felt from your mother, um, where she didn’t necessarily understand you… and there would have been a feeling of abandonment, at least an emotional level from your mother, where you would have wanted to have this, or you would have wanted her to give you a much more deeper, intimate type of relationship.”
Shadow Work Guidance
The Reflection Challenge:
“So what we have to do to fix a lot of it is to say, how does this way I’m feeling apply back into my situation? That’s the challenge with both of them: to do the reflective work. So, Lilith is also the deeper shadow work, the stuff that makes us feel disconnected from the world in general, to understand why. But we don’t wanna get lost in shadow work. We don’t wanna get lost in understanding to a point where we feel like we’re fixing. We wanna get to a point where we say, how can we use, how can we take these feelings and these natural raw desires? How can we take them and reflect those back into our marriage, into our work, into our children and parenting, into our creative endeavors, our own business? How can we take this thing that’s so important to us and apply it back in.”
Key Principles:

Don’t get lost in endless shadow work (avoiding over-analysis paralysis)

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 3.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 4.

Life Story Manifestations
1. Abandoning His Child:
“I ended up leaving my child, my oldest child, because I ended up leaving there. Now, my ex-wife was keeping my kid from me; I wasn’t seeing her, so I made the decision to go after something where I felt like I had purpose… I feel guilty; I feel shame because I abandoned my child; I haven’t been true to myself, and I would have felt the other way had I not been true to myself. I would have felt the same thing. This is how it’s gonna naturally manifest.”
Lilith Manifestation:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 * Guilt/shame around leaving (mean Lilith)
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 * Visceral need for purpose overriding conventional expectations (osculating Lilith)
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 * Catch-22: Would have felt guilt either way (staying or leaving)
Daughter’s Oracle Card Moment:
“I remember she held one up a couple of years ago… she held one up, it was an Oracle card, and it said, you have nothing to be guilty about. It was literally what the card said. And like, I broke down because…She looked at the card, she’s like, you have nothing. She doubled down on it, but I feel guilty.”
2. White Rapper Shame:
“I also felt guilty about the fact I was a white rapper… Back when I was doing music, there was only one and he just came out: Eminem had just come out. And this energy here, I went to a demo or an expo rather and had my demo with me… I remember Def Jam and Interscope. I remember getting there, and I walked up, and my music was nothing like his. But they turned it on… And I remember those two; I got like six seconds into them playing and said, we already have a white boy rapper, we don’t need you. And I actually felt bad about it; I felt like that was not— I wasn’t allowed… I, and I kind of just gave up on music in general, which is right here. Because I used to be relentless.”
Lilith Manifestation:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 * Internalized “not allowed” based on external rejection

3. Hollywood Fetish Content Work:
“Fast forward to Hollywood. So I come out here, I live in my car for two years… At the time, I was doing stuff for… Pretty Little Liars… and was also a stand-in for… Steven Tyler. But I took this because I needed the money… I felt liberated because I had no rules, nobody governing me… I had no PGR, PG-13, no status; I had nothing that I had to do… but I felt shame for it at the time. I don’t anymore; I don’t care. But at the time, for a long time, I did care… So I tried to repress it and hide it and whatever. And the irony is that I had several film production company businesses, and the one that did that content was how I made all my money; the other stuff I did… I didn’t get paid for it, or I didn’t get any sort of recognition.”

Success Story:
“Once I started embracing it, and I just said, screw it, especially after the night shadow stuff, that business had kind of like hit a dip 'cause we haven’t filmed anything in eight years. I embraced it, started advertising it again, and went right back up… So we went from something that was making millions down into six figures… back into the mid-high six figures on something I haven’t done in eight, coming up on nine years.”
4. Verizon Sales Job:
“I work for Verizon…there was something called a sales walk, and I said, no, I’m not doing that…My Lilith would come out very much like I just sounded. Get off my back, dude. And it would come out very visceral… We created this kind of system… when we were selling things, we would bring each other in on the sale… It made us a lot of money… That Lilith was like, I don’t really care if corporate doesn’t like it.”

5. Criticism Compulsion:
“When I got into astrology, I wanted it to be practical. When I do anything, you guys have heard me say, when I got to Hollywood, first thing I said when I got onto set was, this is highly inefficient. That was the first thing I said. I loved it, loved it, but I criticize everything. Again, criticizing too much.”

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 * Aries rising
Interpretation (Verbatim):
“Lilith here. The order here is true…means Lilith, then true Lilith… how you feel internally about something, and the shame and the guilt around motherhood, around family, around your upbringing, around your roots, around real estate… can make you feel like either I’m not a good mom, but I know that I’m supposed to be a mom.”
Live Feedback:
“I manage the department and everybody calls me the mother. That’s what’s funny, yeah.”
Additional Interpretation:
“So the flow for you is what ends up happening is like you’ll feel the guilt and shame first as it connects into your chart. You’ll feel that first when it comes to mental health; when it comes to your job, you feel that first. And because of the conjunction, it immediately stops you from doing anything else. You can’t truly feel things the way you want to. You never truly feel safe because what you needed to feel safe when it comes to your survival instincts, when it comes to accepting the things that are truly yours in your own way, your own, the details and whatnot, because Lilith comes first, and it’s such a hard energy to deal with, which is guilt and shame and all that kind of stuff. It feeds directly into the next, and you have this like immediate reaction. Like I feel guilty and shame, but damn it, I hate this kind of energy.”
Real-World Manifestation:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 * Work identity as “the mother”

Interpretation:
“About your thoughts, your ideas, your communication; anything for you that wraps into details, obviously scheduling and planning things as well. Internal reaction is retrograde, like I said, it’s coming inward, it’s being reflective, and it’s compounding… you’ll stutter over your words when you feel very heightened and emotional about something, and I’ll repeat them.”
Live Feedback:
“Oh yeah, which is not as much as I got a little older, but yeah. Okay, especially when you were younger… especially when it comes to etymology of words, and planning and all that sort of thing.”
Themes:

Interpretation:
“Has to do with friendships, has to do with technology, has to do with groups of people… especially as it pertains to your own beliefs… semi-sextile with Chiron though… Even once you feel like you’re in a group…you can still feel like you don’t want to say, you don’t want to speak; you’re afraid that you don’t know things.”
Real-World Manifestation:
 Sharon actively helps translate and explain concepts in the community:
“I see all the comments. When you guys are helping each other like that, when like Sharon, when you are helping people, and you’re translating… not necessarily translating the language, but translating the thing.”
Chiron-Lilith Interaction:
“If we take that safety… with the North Node and then Lilith with our raw version of that, it all has to lead into Chiron because even once you feel, even once you feel like you’re in a group, and I’m like, I feel okay… you can still feel like you don’t want to say, you don’t want to speak; you’re afraid that you don’t know things. We’ve talked about this; you’ve talked about this a lot.”
12th House Lilith Theme:
“Sharon (Cancer, Lilith in 12th): ‘Cancer spirituality is my jam, but blocked it most of my life. Exactly. It’s your jam because, and the way that you see it…no one else gets it but you.’”
Activity at Time of Webinar:
 Sharon was crocheting during the call—creative outlet as Lilith expression.

Interpretation:
“Again, you’ve got your, you have shame coming before reaction… and you have it in conjunction with all of this… direct. You have your Saturn in retrograde, which is pulling intimacy, shared resources, things of that nature, and your North node…”
Live Feedback:
“I run my own business, and I’m the only one running it at the moment, because I’m too afraid to actually hire anyone because of this energy, I think, and you’re supposed to be delegating.”
Additional Detail:
“Yeah, that makes sense… I hate telling other people what to do because I hate being told what to do.”

Interpretation:
 Shame into intimacy/shared resources/debt, “collaborative aspect… more taboo aspects of things that are either more spiritual or more creative, and being able to apply that, rework all of that, be more comfortable with being able to rework all and apply it in…”
Live Feedback:
“Years, recently I’ve been really thinking of bringing back my woman’s sexual empowerment retreats… but me just bringing the people together to show people that there isn’t shame around that area because I guess I had so much shame in that area.”

Interpretation:
“The order obviously matters, mean Lilith, true Lilith, Chiron. So you have all of these working together. So it’s not only do you feel this agitation within, but you feel guilt and shame first, and then you feel insecure about it. And this is a challenging one, because obviously all of that energy is internalized, so you don’t have that. I want to lash back out.”
Live Feedback:
“I have a hard time speaking up when it comes to a person of authority… right, because you don’t feel like you’re supposed to. And I get that, I get that visceral response to where it’s like that fight or flight feeling. You get a shake. Yes, but if it’s just a normal, normal person, I don’t I don’t feel that, right. I have the same thing, by the way.”

Chiron-Lilith Compounding:
“So normally when we’re just talking about one energy, we say, yada, yada, but for you, you have insecurity that leads into this thing of bringing people in. So you already have that insecurity, even that that should be power in how you see things. There’s Chiron, and Chiron is like, I’m trying to bring things in because I’m trying to prove that I knew something; I’m trying to prove that I have the authority over something. So the ‘I told you so’ is more like, you should have listened to me I knew this; you didn’t listen to me, blah, blah, blah. And it happens, and it creates a friction between you and those other people, and they don’t like it.”

Interpretation:
“Shame within groups, shame within a network, types of settings, shame within random, spontaneous ideas. Like, um, when you have an aha moment… you have that shame; like you feel like you should have known that before, like why didn’t I already know this now? It all makes sense type of energy, uh, and all of that leading back into, um, whether or not you feel like it’s okay to communicate that with others.”

Interpretation:
“When it comes to strategy around family… nurturing, when it comes to dealing with other people, being a bit more intimate, being a bit more personal with other people… sometimes that you can feel like you have to conform to other people’s beliefs… you feel like you can’t say these things; you can’t communicate. And then it adds in with the Chiron here, which is conjuncture, psyche, and retrograde.”
Live Feedback (Communication Strategy):
“Yes, and with one of my closest friends, I always ask her, do you want my true opinion or do you want me to be the okay? And she says, and I’m like, okay, yeah. And that’s what works for me, right?”

Interpretation:
“You have this feeling like an insecurity around your own self, sense of self-worth, like also that it’s not okay for you to verbally say you value yourself… that comes from the family, comes from the mother, comes from like upbringing.

PART 11: ASPECT ANALYSIS
Lilith-Chiron Aspects
Semi-Sextile (Sharon’s Chart):
“Even once you feel like you’re in a group… you can still feel like you don’t want to say, you don’t want to speak; you’re afraid that you don’t know things.”
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 * Chiron’s insecurity feeds Lilith’s repression
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 * Creates compounding effect even in safe spaces
Conjunction (Tanya’s 10th House Stellium):
“Mean Lilith, true Lilith, Chiron. So you have all of these working together. So it’s not only do you feel this agitation within, but you feel guilt and shame first, and then you feel insecure about it.”
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 * Order matters: Which comes first determines flow
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 * Guilt/shame → visceral reaction → insecurity

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 * Creates “I told you so” compensation behavior
Opposition (Instructor’s Chart):
“My true Lilith opposes my Chiron… That’s a tough one.”
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 * Tension between wound (Chiron) and raw need (Lilith)
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 * Must balance both ends of polarity

General Moon-Lilith Theme:
“Remember all of these are also tied into mother as well. Uh-hh, so these elements of guilt and shame are things that you felt from your mother, um, where she didn’t necessarily understand you.”
Lilith-Ascendant Aspects
Sextile (Silas’s Chart):
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 * Self-worth and identity directly connected

General Principle:
“If it creates an aspect to one of your vitality anchors, the ascendant, descendant, mid heaven, and sub heaven… these points are extremely important just for clarity.”

PART 13: TAMING VS. EMBRACING METHODOLOGY
The Decision Framework
Step 1: Let Her Out of the Cage
“We have to start embracing what… And we have to make sure that we don’t go so far as to alienate all their people, alienate society, alienate ourselves from reality.”
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 * Acknowledge the energy
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 * Investigate without judgment
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 * Don’t repress (leads to illness/shadow)
Step 2: Don’t Let Her Off the Leash
“If you let her off of the leash… there’s this feeling of I could just let go right now. I could let go, and I could drift off into the ether of space, and I would have no responsibility. I would have no connection to anybody.”
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 * Don’t indulge every impulse uncritically
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 * Maintain connection to others and reality
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 * Balance expression with responsibility
Questions to Ask (Taming Process):
For Mean Lilith (Internal):
“The first thing with mean Lilith is to say, why do I feel guilty about this? Why do I feel shameful about this? Is there actually shame here or is this something I needed? And that’s the question you have to ask yourself when it comes to that, is why am I allowing this to play out where I can’t be me because I’m supposed to be like everybody else?”
For Osculating Lilith (External/Visceral):
“Instead, what I did is I claimed my power. I claimed my power, and the thing that they criticized me on, I turned into a lesson, not a lesson to prove them wrong or show anything against them. I just made that the next thing I’m going to talk about.”
Embracing Process:
1. Power Reclamation:
 Turn criticism/wound into teaching or creative opportunity
2. Radical Self-Acceptance:
“Lilith represents in both forms radical self-acceptance… This is really you. Where’s your Lilith? That’s you. When you’re building a business, your Lilith is what you’re supposed to focus on.”
3. Strategic Application:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 * Find outlets (creative, business, spiritual) that respect both self and others
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 * Don’t deny needs, but reflect before acting them out
4. Community Building:
“What makes you special? What makes you different? What makes you, what do you really need in terms of security, in terms of your deep inner wants? How do I pull in other people who are crazy too?”
Seek/attract others who are similarly “radical” or unconventional.
Retrograde-Specific Guidance:
For Osculating Retrograde Lilith:
“Also, realizing that with Lilith in retrograde, you can’t find what’s safe; you have to make what’s safe. This is one of those retrograde things: if Jupiter’s natural, you go find opportunity. If Jupiter is retrograde or not direct retrograde, you have to make opportunity or find opportunity within opportunity. So if you have Lilith and osculating Lilith retrograde, then you don’t have the same energy that says, I’m gonna go somewhere and it’s going to be safe. I’m going to go somewhere and while I’m there, I’m gonna go find my safe space in there.”

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 * Can’t find safety externally

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 * Find niche within larger groups (“on the fringe”)

PART 14: HEALING AND OPTIMIZATION STRATEGIES
Core Healing Principles
1. Radical Self-Acceptance:
“Ultimately, Lilith represents in both forms radical self-acceptance. The problem is that we are so trained and indoctrinated by social norms, conventional upbringing, all of these things that happen in the world, how other people do it, that nobody allows other people to be themselves.”
2. Recognize Internal vs. External Oppression:
“If you actually pay attention to mean Lilith, nobody told you that you weren’t allowed to do this. Nobody said that. Nobody said you can’t do this. It’s just that when you express yourself in that way, you get a reaction from other people, and it’s not, sometimes it’s verbal, but it’s usually not. It’s usually a feeling.”
3. Move from Insight to Action:
“But we don’t wanna get lost in shadow work. We don’t wanna get lost in understanding to a point where we feel like we’re fixing. We wanna get to a point where we say, how can we use, how can we take these feelings and these natural raw desires? How can we take them and reflect those back into our marriage, into our work, into our children and parenting, into our creative endeavors, our own business?”
Practical Techniques

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 1. “Why do I feel guilty about this?”
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 2. “Is there actually shame here or is this something I needed?”
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 3. “Am I allowing this to play out where I can’t be me because I’m supposed to be like everybody else?”
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 4. “How can I take this raw desire and reflect it back into [specific life area]?”
Reflection Practice:
“What it does for you positively, it allows you to reflect on these things. What makes you special? What makes you different?”
Business/Career Application:
“When you’re building a business, your Lilith is what you’re supposed to focus on… It is the most important thing outside of the ascendant for your career. It literally tells you who you are, how you’re gonna do it, and what’s important to you.”
Integration with Alchemistic Concepts
Energy Flow (PHSR):
 Always track which Lilith (mean or osculating) comes first and feeds into what.
Delegates:
 Check which planets rule houses where Lilith sits—those planets act as delegates amplifying or coloring Lilith’s impact.
Fusion Cusp:
 When Lilith straddles houses, hybrid effects occur (not averaged, but blended).
Retrograde Doctrine:
 Retrograde osculating Lilith means energy is compounding internally, requiring “making” safety rather than “finding” it.
Lenses:
 Lilith applies differently depending on question asked (career lens, relationship lens, health lens, etc.).

PART 15: COMMON MISTAKES AND MISCONCEPTIONS
Technical/Calculation Errors
1. Using Interpolated Lilith:
“You have the Priapus, which is interpolated, and we have Lilith, which is interpolated. We don’t want either of these two because an interpolated Lilith or an interpreted Priapus… These two are basically averages between osculating and mean. And it’s, I haven’t found any validity for these, so I don’t use them.”
Correct Method:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 * Use H13 for osculating/true Lilith
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 * Use mean for averaged/internalized Lilith
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 * Avoid interpolated versions entirely
2. Ignoring Osculating/True Lilith:
“Very rarely do people talk about oscillating Lilith, which is ironic because it’s actually more important, in my opinion.”
3. Confusing “Mean” as “Angry”:
“Mean means average, right? It doesn’t mean mean; however, it does mean mean. So, it’s the word M-E-A-N, because it’s the average.”
Interpretive Mistakes
4. Over-Relying on Mythology:
“You love the Lilith backstory; it’s a great backstory. Some of it doesn’t apply to the astrology, but it’s fun.”
Don’t use myth as literal predictive tool.
5. Conflating Chiron and Lilith:
“It doesn’t share the exact thing; it really doesn’t share any of the themes of Chiron unless it’s linked to it.”
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 * Chiron = public wound/compensation
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 * Lilith = private shame/authenticity
6. Assuming Social Rejection is Real:
“Other people are not making you feel that way; you’re making yourself feel that way.”
Most Lilith shame is internalized/projected, not externally imposed.
7. Ignoring Energy Flow/Order:
“Order of planets, the exact placement, the way the energy flows in terms of zodiacally, or, you know, whether it’s applying or separating, which one came first, which one has to be resolved, which one’s causing the friction; super important stuff.”
Lesser degree comes first—this determines how themes manifest sequentially.
8. Not Distinguishing Mean vs. Osculating Manifestations:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 * Mean: Internal, consistent, thematic (guilt/shame)
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 * Osculating: External, acute, visceral (raw reactions)
9. Treating Lilith Transits as One-Time Events:
“True Lilith returns happen in clusters.”
Due to erratic orbit, returns come in groups, not single events.
10. Getting Lost in Shadow Work:
“We don’t wanna get lost in understanding to a point where we feel like we’re fixing.”
Must move from insight to practical application quickly.

Interpretation Logic Flow
Step 1: Position Analysis
IF mean_lilith.degree < osculating_lilith.degree:
    primary_lilith = mean_lilith
    secondary_lilith = osculating_lilith
ELSE:
    primary_lilith = osculating_lilith
    secondary_lilith = mean_lilith


Display: "Your [primary] Lilith at [degree] [sign] in [house] 
         creates [theme], which then flows into your [secondary] 
         Lilith at [degree] [sign] in [house], manifesting as [theme]."


Step 2: Retrograde Check
IF osculating_lilith.retrograde == TRUE:
    interpretation += "Your osculating Lilith is retrograde, 
                       meaning this energy redirects inward. 
                       Instead of reacting to others, you turn 
                       frustration/rebellion on yourself. 
                       You must CREATE safety rather than FIND it."


Step 3: Aspect Integration
FOR each aspect TO [Asc, MC, Desc, IC, Sun, Moon, Chiron, Nodes]:
    IF aspect EXISTS:
        interpretation += aspect_specific_text
        IF aspect TO Chiron:
            interpretation += "This compounds wound/shame cycles..."
        IF aspect TO Moon:
            interpretation += "Maternal themes, security needs..."


Step 4: Fusion Cusp Detection
IF abs(lilith.degree - house_cusp.degree) <= 2:
    interpretation += "Your Lilith is on a FUSION CUSP, 
                       blending themes of [house1] and [house2]. 
                       Expect hybrid manifestations..."

PART 17: ADVANCED CONCEPTS AND Q&A
Lilith Returns
Cycle Timing:
“We have a Lilith return almost every nine years, and these Lilith returns are important, especially that last one, because that last one is going to last you for those nine years.”
8.85-Year Average:
 More precise than “9 years”—app should calculate exact returns.
Clustered Returns:
“Now, true Lilith returns happen in clusters.”
Due to erratic orbit, Lilith can return multiple times in a short period, then not return for years. App must predict clusters, not just single events.
Instructor’s Experience:
“After my divorce, I ended up leaving my child… This happened around a Lilith return. Every single time I left, I moved to Texas, I moved back. I moved to New York, I moved back. I moved to Virginia, I moved back, moved to North Carolina, moved back, Florida, moved back. The only time I didn’t was my Saturn return.”
Lilith and Career
Most Important Career Indicator (After Ascendant):
“It is the most important thing outside of the ascendant for your career. It literally tells you who you are, how you’re gonna do it, and what’s important to you.”
Why Career Connection:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * Shows where you need radical authenticity

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * Points to taboo/unconventional income sources that may be most lucrative
Instructor’s Proof:
 Fetish content business (8th house taboo) made millions, while conventional film work barely paid.
Lilith as Gut Instinct/Survival Mode
“Lilith is your survival mode; it is the thing that tells you I shouldn’t be here, I shouldn’t be doing this. This is more your gut feeling than your moon placement.”

App Feature Idea:
 “Safety Compass” - tool to help users distinguish Moon (comfort) from Lilith (survival) responses in decision-making.
Lilith and Astro-Cartography
Question from audience about whether Lilith should be included in location readings.
Instructor’s Position:
 While not explicitly detailed in this webinar, the emphasis on Lilith’s importance suggests it should be factored into relocation astrology, especially for career/authenticity considerations.
Empty Focus and Oppositions
Philosophical Framework:
“This is called empty focus. The other name for black moon Lilith osculating is true lunar apogee… It’s not real; this is real. This is not real. However, we have to have a little bit of craziness; we have to have a little bit of not real in our lives because it makes us true to ourselves.”
Oppositions:
“Oppositions are not a pull… It’s your focus that’s doing that.”
Instructor challenges traditional opposition interpretation—not about external tension but about where you choose to focus attention.
Velocity and Orbital Mechanics
Audience Question (Tanya):
“Wouldn’t the way the planets orbit the sun affect the orbs within a chart?”
Instructor’s Response:
“See, I knew these questions were coming. That we haven’t proven, or that I haven’t proven, but I believe that. So it’s one of those shelved theories that I’m still testing. I’m still trying to figure out a couple of things. Velocity is usually consistent, so I don’t have to worry about that. But empty focus for other orbit patterns is one thing that I’ve thought of.”
App Development Note:
 Advanced/experimental feature could explore variable orbs based on orbital mechanics, but current system uses standard orbs.
South Node and Lilith Connection
“Mine’s conjunct my South node. Also, remember that the South node and Lilith are all mathematical points off of the moon itself, which should explain my childhood. So, the way that your mother reacted to you and the raw, visceral parts of your mother and your family are also expressed in Lilith.”
Mathematical Connection:
 Both South Node and Lilith are lunar-derived points, creating inherent resonance in interpretations, especially around:

PART 18: PHILOSOPHICAL FOUNDATIONS
Free Will vs. Determinism
Core Teaching:
“A lot of us think we have free will; we think we made choices. There is an illusion of free will that’s in there. A lot of times we think we’ve made choices. I always tell you, if I’m able to guess what you did by looking at your chart, you didn’t actually exert free will.”
True Free Will:
“If I’m doing a reading for you or someone else, another alchemistic astrologer is doing a reading and it’s within the same energy, but it’s not the expected outcome; that’s free will.”
Implications for App:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * Don’t present interpretations as fixed destiny
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * Emphasize choice and conscious engagement
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * Frame readings as “potential state” that can be transformed into “kinetic state”
Radical Self-Acceptance
Central Philosophy:
“Lilith represents in both forms radical self-acceptance. The problem is that we are so trained and indoctrinated by social norms, conventional upbringing, all of these things that happen in the world, how other people do it, that nobody allows other people to be themselves. And the radical self-acceptance means true self. This is really you. Where’s your Lilith? That’s you.”
Identity Equation:
 Lilith = True Self
Not a wound, not a flaw, but who you actually are beneath social conditioning.
“The Crazy”
“And Lilith is our crazy. That’s the other thing. You love the Lilith backstory; it’s a great backstory. Some of it doesn’t apply to the astrology, but it’s fun. The Lilith in your chart is crazy. Are you crazy enough to believe what you’re doing? Are you crazy enough to do the things that you want to do? Or are you ashamed and you make yourself small in this world?”
Reframing “Crazy”:
 Not mentally ill, but unconventional/radical enough to:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * Challenge norms
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * Pursue authentic path
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * Risk rejection for truth
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * Build something others dismiss
Humility and Evolution
Instructor’s Stance:
“At the end of the day, I’ve also mentioned I don’t believe that I’m the best astrologer because I don’t believe that. I truly believe I am not the best astrologer… There will always be people better than me… At the end of the day, when it comes to even alchemistic astrology, whether it’s one of you guys in this room or listening to this replay, or somebody else that comes in the future, there’s going to be somebody who’s gonna surpass me.”
System Philosophy:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * Alchemistic Astrology is evolving

App Implication:
 Build in feedback loops for users to contribute insights, challenge interpretations, suggest improvements.
Hypocrisy and Human Limitation
“Every single person on this planet is hypocritical on something.”
Teaching Point:
 Don’t expect perfection from yourself or your Lilith integration. Everyone contradicts themselves—the goal is awareness and gradual alignment, not flawless consistency.

PART 19: CLOSING INSIGHTS AND SUMMARY
Webinar Conclusion
Instructor’s Hope:
“Are there any other questions to round out this Black Moon Lilith? I hope you guys gained value and insight over Black Moon Lilith. It’s one of those things; it’s really hard to find really good information on Black Moon Lilith. It’s one of those things that, without the testing and really seeing it play out, it could be hard to understand or interpret, which is why I took that extra time with you guys to go through multiple charts so you could see it and then obviously get the reaction from it.”
Educational Goal:
“I want to see people learn alchemistic astrology be like, Oh, damn, this is real. I learned it. I millionaire. I want to see that. Gotta gotta add that correction. Which correction? Billionaire? Yeah, the whole thing. That’s what I want.”
Community Appreciation:
 Multiple participants expressed gratitude:
“When I was your age, I did not have my head on my shoulders. I definitely didn’t believe in astrology, I didn’t have any guidance or anything like that… You have no idea how much I appreciate your astrology and this community, so thank you so much.”
Authority Deflection:
“I feel like you’re the authority in astrology. Dammit, that’s very kind of you. I don’t see myself as the authority; I don’t want to be the authority.”
(Notably, this is a 10th house Lilith manifestation—discomfort with being seen as authority despite teaching expertise.)

PART 20: KEY QUOTES FOR APP INTEGRATION
Technical Quotes
“H 13 is osculating Lilith. This is true Lilith; this is the one that you should have in here so that you make sure that you have that entered, and you can see it on your chart over here.”
“Mean means average… It has to do with the smooth route of the moon in its orbit around the earth, and it gives us a very non-specific but averaged out rounded a point that is the average focal area of Lilith.”
“Oscillating Lilith factors in all of that gravitational pull to give you very precise positioning of where Lilith truly is; if you factor everything else.”
“Order of planets, the exact placement, the way the energy flows in terms of zodiacally, or, you know, whether it’s applying or separating, which one came first, which one has to be resolved, which one’s causing the friction; super important stuff.”
Philosophical Quotes
“Along with Chiron, I think this is one of the most important points in your chart.”
“Lilith represents in both forms radical self-acceptance… This is really you. Where’s your Lilith? That’s you.”
“I used to say a long time ago if you wanna use Lilith properly, you have to let her out of the cage, but not let her off of the leash.”
“If I’m able to guess what you did by looking at your chart, you didn’t actually exert free will.”
“When you’re building a business, your Lilith is what you’re supposed to focus on.”
“It is the most important thing outside of the ascendant for your career. It literally tells you who you are, how you’re gonna do it, and what’s important to you.”
Healing Quotes
“But we don’t wanna get lost in shadow work. We don’t wanna get lost in understanding to a point where we feel like we’re fixing. We wanna get to a point where we say, how can we use, how can we take these feelings and these natural raw desires? How can we take them and reflect those back into our marriage, into our work, into our children and parenting, into our creative endeavors, our own business?”
“The first thing with mean Lilith is to say, why do I feel guilty about this? Why do I feel shameful about this? Is there actually shame here or is this something I needed?”
“With Lilith in retrograde, you can’t find what’s safe; you have to make what’s safe.”

TRANSCRIPT 18: FCA VS OOI CUSP WEBINAR
Harvard-Level Knowledge Extraction for Alchemistic Astrology App Development
Date: January 18, 2025
Topic: Fusion Cusp Area (FCA) vs. Orb of Influence (OOI) - Technical Distinctions
Word Count: ~22,000 words
Instructor: Logan (Alchemistic Astrology System)

PART 1: INTRODUCTION AND WEBINAR PURPOSE
Opening Framework
Purpose Statement (Verbatim):
“Welcome to the Orb of Influence versus the Fusion Cusp Area webinar. I got through it. That’s great. We are going to talk about what the difference is when a planet is sitting within a Fusion Cusp Area, which is from 28.5 degrees to 1.5 degrees of the next sign versus when it’s sitting before 28.5 degrees and the orb of influence is reaching into the next sign.”
Core Distinction:
“So the concepts are, they seem very similar on the surface until you start actually looking at what we’re talking about here. So one of the main things between the two is whether or not you have a secondary ruler.”
Why This Matters
This webinar addresses a fundamental gap in traditional astrology:
The Problem with “Anaretic Degrees”:
“Anaeretic degrees and critical degrees is a big thing in traditional astrology and when I got to it I just had a gut feeling that that didn’t make any sense. Because they would, I don’t like when you dwell on something. I don’t like when somebody dwells on something and explains away everything with a, well, it’s at 29 degrees. So, you know, whatever. I was like, why? Why does 29 degrees matter? Why do you keep saying zero and 29 degrees? Why do you keep saying that? Oh, it’s an aneretic degree. I get that you’re calling it that, but give me some sort of proof. Like, tell me why. I need the mechanics of it. Nobody could answer that question.”
The Solution: Mechanical Understanding
“So then I started looking at it and I started realizing that it’s not just 29 degrees. It kind of seeps into the 28-degree marker. And if any of you guys have gone through your progressions, when something hits 28 and a half degrees, it feels like 29 degrees. It feels like 29 and a half degrees. You’re sitting there like this needs to end. You feel that. You feel that other energy creeping in. You’re like, ‘I’m ready to move on.’ And it’s like, ‘Why do you feel that?’ You know, it’s not necessarily the orb of influence. Like that’s definitely reaching into the next, but it doesn’t— the reason why it feels like you’re supposed to be in the next energy is because you are in the next energy, right? When you hit 28 and a half degrees, the other energy seeping in, you’re in it.”

PART 2: TECHNICAL DEFINITIONS
FUSION CUSP AREA (FCA)
Exact Definition:
“Fusion Cusp Area, which is from 28.5 degrees to 1.5 degrees of the next sign.”
Degree Range:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * 28.5° to 29°59’59" of current sign
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * 0°00’ to 1.5° of next sign

Key Characteristics:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          1. Energy Blending: Both sign/house energies actively mix
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          2. Secondary Ruler: The next sign’s ruler becomes an active secondary ruler
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          3. Intensification: “Because they’re overlapped, it’s hitting multiple energies… it intensifies”
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          4. Bidirectional Flow: Energy flows both ways across the cusp

“It’s energy. It pulsates. It’s fluid. It’s malleable. It’s just like light. If you shine two lights next to each other, you’re going to have spill off in the middle, a red light and a… A blue light is going to have a purple overlay if they, you know, come across if they’re too close to each other, right? It’s the same type of vibe that you’re going to get here.”
Overlapping Papers Analogy:
“Like if you were to take overlapping papers and you were to put them actually overlap them just a little bit, right? And you were to take, you know, there’s a line here and a line here, and you were to take a pin and put it, what side of the line is that pin sitting? The pinpoint is happening in the eighth house… The energies are happening definitively on this side of that line versus this side, but they are overlapping. Right. So therefore that energy is seeped in.”
ORB OF INFLUENCE (OOI)
Definition:
“Mars has a four-degree orb of influence. You know, so it’s already reaching into the next sign and then it’s not at 28 and a half. So this would be an example of it sitting within the orb of influence, it’s reaching into the next sign, but not within the fusion cusperia.”
Key Characteristics:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          1. Extension, Not Blending: Influence reaches but doesn’t mix
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          2. No Secondary Ruler: Only primary ruler applies
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          3. Byproduct Effect: “It is just kind of a byproduct… as opposed to when it’s in the fusion cusp area. It is directly influencing that.”
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          4. Unidirectional: Energy flows into next house but doesn’t create true blend
Critical Distinction (Verbatim):
“And the main difference between those is whether or not the energies of the next sign are encapsulating the energies of the previous planet. So when it is sitting here like this at 27 degrees, we’re going to read it… Mars is going to stay. Its ruler is the moon. It is only reaching into the next energy. It is not mixed with it, if that makes sense.”
“However, when you read this, you’re not really going to use… Not really. You’re not ever going to use the sun as a secondary ruler for Mars. Mars is going to stay. Its ruler is the moon. It is only reaching into the next energy. It is not mixed with it.”

PART 3: THE SECONDARY RULER CONCEPT
When Does Secondary Ruler Apply?
FCA Only:
“So one of the main things between the two is whether or not you have a secondary ruler.”
Example: Mars at 29°50’ Cancer (FCA):
“To read this, you’re going to do exactly the same thing you did before, but you’re going to add one component. So this Mars at 29 degrees is still by orb of influence reaching in. But to be completely honest, that only really matters if there’s another planet over here. If there’s no other planet, the orb of influence is kind of irrelevant because it’s already sitting within the fusion cusp area, which means it’s already blending the area, the energies from the second house from the first house into the second house, and the energies of the first house pulling the second house in because of that overlap. What you’re doing is you’re reading the sun, because it’s the ruler of Leo, you’re reading this as a secondary ruler. You’re reading the moon as the primary ruler because it is definitively in the first house. It is a first house placement. But because it’s in that fusion cuspary, it’s blending the energies of the second house. And as a result, the sun becomes a second ruler. For Mars.”

House Belonging vs. Energy Blending
Critical Clarification:
“The house ‘belonging’ is determined by the side of the cusp/houselines, not merely by degree proximity.”

PART 4: MATHEMATICAL/ASTRONOMICAL BASIS
The 28.5° Threshold
Not Arbitrary:
“When I got to it I just had a gut feeling that that didn’t make any sense… So then I started looking at it and I started realizing that it’s not just 29 degrees. It kind of seeps into the 28-degree marker. And if any of you guys have gone through your progressions, when something hits 28 and a half degrees, it feels like 29 degrees.”
Empirical Basis:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * Progressions: People report feeling the shift at 28.5°, not 29°
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * Client Experience: “You feel that other energy creeping in”
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * Consistent Observation: Not a single-degree phenomenon
Precision Matters:
“Technically, technically, if we’re using a strict 28… but these two are conjunct anyway. So you have a similar influence. It’s just not as heavy, so to speak.”
Energy as Fluid, Not Fixed
Core Philosophy:
“It’s energy. It pulsates. It’s fluid. It’s malleable. It’s just like light.”
Gradient Effect:
“…imagine for a second the interlocking of these energies and a gradient effect from the first house seeping into the second house. If I did this properly, it would also be two different colors, but the second house then seeping back into the first house.”
Not Binary:
 The energy doesn’t “switch” at 0° of a sign—it blends in the transition zone.

PART 5: HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT
Origin Story
The Problem:
“Anaeretic degrees, if you go back and research what anaeretic means, it’s some variant of fate and fortune, destiny, karma, all of those things. I was like, I don’t subscribe to that. So I need something that I can explain this away. But also when I see it, I know what it means. I know how it’s going to play out. And that’s where Fusion Cusp Area came.”
The “Born on a Cusp” Myth:
“And then it was a combination of everybody being like, ‘I was born on a cusp. No, you weren’t. You were born near a cusp.’”
Instructor’s Mandate:
“If you can’t prove it, it’s not good for me. And that’s just how I view things because I just need to be, if I’m going to show up and be like, this is what this means, I better back that ish up. That’s how I feel. And if I can’t prove myself, I’m a washout.”
Testing Process
“So I had to, so I was left with nothing with Chiron. I had to go back and like use this and use the astronomy of it and then just kind of like really kind of pull it together and be like and then test the theories and be like, ah, I see it. So I had to do the same thing with like all of these…”
Methodology:

PART 6: INTERPRETATION METHODOLOGY
Step-by-Step Process
1. Determine Exact Degree:
 Check the planet’s precise degree (including arc minutes).
2. Classify as FCA or OOI:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * If 28.5° to 29°59’ OR 0° to 1.5°: FCA
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * If before 28.5° but within orb: OOI
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * Otherwise: Standard placement
3. Identify Primary Ruler:
 Always the ruler of the sign/house the planet is IN (by cusp line).
4. Check for Secondary Ruler (FCA Only):
 If in FCA, identify the ruler of the NEXT sign/house.
5. Apply Energy Blending (FCA) or Extension (OOI):
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * FCA: “Blending the energies of the second house… as a result, the sun becomes a second ruler”
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * OOI: “It is only reaching into the next energy. It is not mixed with it”
Layering Technique
Core Philosophy:
“I called it layering as opposed to like I fixed, in my opinion, I fixed dispositorship. Dispositorship was weird, but I liked what they were trying to do. I just thought you’re skipping a lot of things along the way. So the reason why, when I thought that, I said, layer it one layer at a time. Figure out what this means before you move on. That’s what the layering is supposed to be.”
Process:
“I figure out this energy. What’s this Venus? Give me all the information on this Venus placement. So when I understand this Venus placement, cool, I got that. Now what? Well Chiron’s in there too. Well what does that mean? Well first off it’s you know what 17 or so degrees away. Well what is 17 degrees away? First off I know that it means two separate decans but I also know that distance is time in astrology. I don’t know if i’ve taught this before but distance is time. So the closer two planets are, the sooner they’ll interact with each other, the sooner they’ll interact with transits. The further they get away, even within the same energy, the more time will pass before that second thing kicks in.”

Interpretation (Verbatim):
“At 27 degrees and a four-degree orb of influence, we know that it reaches into the second house. So we know that it’s an Aries energy that’s expressed through Cancer… However, when you read this, you’re not really going to use… Not really. You’re not ever going to use the sun as a secondary ruler for Mars. Mars is going to stay. Its ruler is the moon. It is only reaching into the next energy. It is not mixed with it, if that makes sense.”

Description: “Everything that happens in the first house… it’s going to lead directly into… and basically pour its energy very slightly into the second house, which links these two houses together.”
Key Point:
“Because it sits so close to the second house, though, this is going to infuse its energy into the second house… However, when you read this, you’re not really going to use… the sun as a secondary ruler for Mars.”

Intensity: Increased (hitting multiple energies simultaneously)
Complete Breakdown:
“What you’re doing is you’re reading the sun, because it’s the ruler of Leo, you’re reading this as a secondary ruler. You’re reading the moon as the primary ruler because it is definitively in the first house. It is a first house placement. But because it’s in that fusion cuspary, it’s blending the energies of the second house. And as a result, the sun becomes a second ruler. For Mars, so in this for instance, we’re going to look for the moon. The moon is in Sagittarius for this one, and the sun is up here in, uh, Aries.”
Energy Flow:
“So when it’s in the fusion cusp area, or I’m sorry, when it’s in the fusion cusp area, it is directly influencing that. So your actions that you take through are through cancerian energy… it’s also at the same time through a secondhand motion and a simultaneous motion influencing your value, your money.”
Comparison to OOI:
“This will be different if it were at 27 degrees, because while it influences over… It’s not through the direct actions themselves. It is just kind of a byproduct… as opposed to when it’s in the fringe area, or I’m sorry, when it’s in the fusion cusp area. It is directly influencing that.”

The ascendant is your motivations… So the ascendant sitting in that Neptune decan of cancer is going to, uh, let’s ignore Mars for a second… the ascendant would be—your motivations would be blended in with value… You would only do it if it made sense materially… recognition through the things that you have or the… or the money that you make, if it was something that could be expressed.”

EXAMPLE 4: Venus Transitioning Through FCA
Scenario Analysis:
“If it was say venus right and venus’s influence in your second house would be strictly for value making money having possessions. Once it starts hitting up at like one degree, five arc minutes, it is now affecting your physical body. It is affecting what you look like. It is affecting. It is affecting your actions and your motivations because it’s within that energy.”
Breakdown:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * Venus at 6° (2nd house): Strictly value/money/possessions
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * Venus at 1°5’ (FCA entering 1st): NOW affects physical body, appearance, actions
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * Reason: “Because it’s within that energy”
Conjunction Through FCA:
“This obviously is a conjunction that goes through both. And like I said before, this affects your physical body, right? Because it’s sitting at one degree. This person is going to have additional Mars traits, which wouldn’t normally show because Mars is not in the first house.”

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * Blending: 8th house (trauma, intimacy, shared resources) + 9th house (philosophy, expansion, teaching)
Initial Question:
“So, my question is, if the north node was in that cusp, you’d have to look at the moon as well? Because it’s derived off the moon? No.”
Clarification:
“When you assess the north node, you do have to assess it with the moon in terms of not how it’s linked to the moon, but as like a math equation. Your north node does not work without your moon placement… So whenever you’re looking at where your north node sits and factoring everything in, you also have to look at your moon because you’re not going to do anything without your moon.”
Follow-up:
“So with both the North Node and Chiron, in that fusion cusp, it would go both ways, both houses? Yes.”
Complete Interpretation (Verbatim):
“When you have Chiron here, Chiron, the weaknesses with it, the insecurities that come with Chiron but also the authenticity that comes with it are sitting on the border of your eighth house and your ninth house. So, what does that mean for you? It means that the things that didn’t go so great— let’s talk about trauma, since that’s your book. Yeah. The traumas that have happened in your book, and obviously, the eighth house means a whole bunch of things, but the traumas that have happened in your life are mixed in with aggression, expansion on aggression, which means it becomes big, heated arguments, big issues over authority, and uh, and long-lasting, uh, huge. Oh my god. Right.”
Comparison to Non-FCA Placement:
“And this is the difference between Chiron sitting two degrees earlier. Right. And Chiron sitting at 29.”
Detailed Breakdown:
“Chiron sits at 29. So it’s definitely eighth house. The insecurities are definitely eighth house related, but they’re also ninth house related because that energy is spilling in. It’s just coming from the lens of the eighth house. So it’s affecting that ninth house. And it’s part of that ninth house, which means Chiron’s ruler is not just, because it’s in the fusion gospel area, it’s not just Neptune, but it’s also Mars. All of this is sitting here in your fourth house of subconscious trauma. It’s sitting down here when it comes to family, when it comes to your mother, especially when it comes to culture and your own culture, the way that you see culture.”
North Node Addition:
“With the North Node, though, it’s connecting that energy back in and putting an extra emphasis for you in that ninth house energy where Saturn, Vesta, all this other stuff is, Fama. And it’s saying that, you know, within the first decan of Aries, it’s saying that this energy is hard for you to be comfortable with, hard for you to grasp most of your life. It takes you out of your comfort zone. It literally opposes your default settings. Which means there’s more of a, I know this is happening. I know it’s likely going to continue, but I don’t know why it’s happening. I don’t know how to stop it. Yeah. Because it’s sitting in opposition over here.”
Life Validation:
“But it says that the North node, you know, through this, and remember it’s Chiron, then the North node in the order. It’s saying that the North Node is to feed your insecurities, to feed your authenticity, to feed what you’ve experienced in that way into what you’re supposed to grow into emotionally. In terms of spiritual growth. Yes. And that is Ninth House Energy.”
Participant Feedback:
“The one comment that you made to me that really helped me between the eighth and ninth house was that the ninth house was my life story. That made a difference. Yeah. Hugely. Yeah.”
Technical Summary:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * Nemesis: Near Moon (asteroid of self-sabotage)
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * Nessus: Also in proximity
Initial Question:
“Uh nemesis moon i have my moon i have my moon uh zero zero one twelfth house would that be why i don’t know what i’m feeling sometimes because there’s an element of detachment from it yes anita can i pull up your chart yeah go ahead.”
Interpretation:
“So you have that semi-sextile to the ascendant so how you feel about things and your security… I mean well first off the 12th house can be very much like I don’t know what I’m feeling. Yeah, but then you might write it off. You’d be like, I don’t know what I’m feeling, whatever. Yeah, that’s the 11th house coming in. It’s like, I want to know what I’m feeling. I’m feeling some kind of way. I feel sensitive about something, especially, you know, interacting with certain other people.”
Nemesis Retrograde Effect:
“Nemesis doesn’t have a… Yay! First off, it’s retrograde. Yeah. That’s already a tough one because nemesis is where you are your own worst enemy… but also when it’s retrograde it’s like you not only are you your own worst enemy but you do it where no one knows you’re your own worst enemy.”
Combined Effect:
“Especially since you’re basically taking nemesis and nessus energy and feeding it slightly into your moon placement as well, which can create a situation where you end up not processing your emotion and not letting go of things you should let go of.”
Key Themes:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * 12th House (Primary): Subconscious, hidden emotions, “I don’t know what I’m feeling”
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * 11th House (Blended via FCA): Groups, detachment, “whatever” attitude
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * Result: Emotional confusion + social detachment + self-sabotage internalized
Technical Note:
 Moon at 0°01’ is exactly at cusp but in FCA range (0-1.5°), so blending applies.

PARTICIPANT C: Retrograde Mercury in 7th House at 29°
Hypothetical Question:
“My only question at the moment is like a retrograde like what if, like, let’s just say that someone has like a mercury retrograde in the seventh house, but it’s at 29 degrees. Is it like reverse to where it’s like taking something from the eighth house and then it’s moving down into the seventh?”
Answer:
“No, you’re still going to read it exactly the same, but you’re going to apply on the planet level. You’re going to apply the properties of the retrograde. Okay. So you’re blending eighth house energy in, but then it’s blending into Mercury. Mercury’s retrograde. The eighth house isn’t retrograde. Okay, that makes sense. Yeah, so you just read it the same except when you get to the retrograde of Mercury, you’re just like, okay, well, all of that from trauma, from shared resources is now working inward through logical processes or whatever the delegate is. Does that make sense? Yeah, that makes sense. Okay, cool. That was a good question.”
Key Principle:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * FCA applies normally (blend 7th and 8th house themes)

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * Integration: 8th house themes (trauma, shared resources) → Mercury retrograde (internal processing, communication turned inward)

PART 9: HOUSE-BY-HOUSE FCA EFFECTS
1st/2nd House Cusp (Identity/Value)
Theme: Self-expression tied to material recognition
Example:
“The ascendant would be—your motivations would be blended in with value… You would only do it if it made sense materially… recognition through the things that you have or the money that you make.”
Career Manifestation:
“Somebody who has a 29… degree when they do things their career themselves you might see a career somebody with a career um ironically we talk about how funny it is that they say leo risings all have their bankers right but this might actually be one.”

8th/9th House Cusp (Trauma/Expansion)
Theme: Deep transformation blended with teaching/philosophy

PART 10: PLANET-BY-PLANET CONSIDERATIONS
Mars (Action/Drive)
Standard Placement:
“Mars in the first house which is also aries energy”
FCA Effect:

Venus (Value/Relationships)
Transition Example:
“If it was say venus right and venus’s influence in your second house would be strictly for value making money having possessions. Once it starts hitting up at like one degree, five arc minutes, it is now affecting your physical body. It is affecting what you look like.”

North/South Node (Karmic Axis)
Special Consideration:
“When you assess the north node, you do have to assess it with the moon in terms of not how it’s linked to the moon, but as like a math equation. Your north node does not work without your moon placement.”
FCA Application:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * Nodes in FCA blend both house themes

Asteroids (Nemesis, Nessus, etc.)
Nemesis Retrograde Example:
“Nemesis doesn’t have a… First off, it’s retrograde… That’s already a tough one because nemesis is where you are your own worst enemy… but also when it’s retrograde it’s like you not only are you your own worst enemy but you do it where no one knows you’re your own worst enemy.”
FCA Effect:
 If Nemesis is in FCA, self-sabotage themes blend between adjacent houses.

Delegates and Energy Flow
Delegation in FCA:
“Because of it being a delegate, it is going to be encapsulating the energy of the 10th house. So it’s going to have Saturnian qualities as well. It’s going to embody the sun. It’s going to embody Chiron, the mid-heaven and Neptune as a delegate of the 10th house. And that’s all going to sit here in the first house.”
FCA Amplifies Delegation:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * Intensifies by “hitting multiple energies… at the same exact time”

Retrograde Doctrine
Key Principle:
“You’re still going to read it exactly the same, but you’re going to apply on the planet level. You’re going to apply the properties of the retrograde.”
FCA + Retrograde:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          1. Blending happens normally (FCA rules apply)
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          2. Retrograde modifies planet (not house or blend)
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          3. Result: Blended themes express inwardly/reflectively
Example:
 Mercury retrograde at 29° in 7th house:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * 7th house (relationships) + 8th house (intimacy/trauma) blend
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * Mercury retrograde: communication/thought turns inward
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * Combined: Relationship issues and shared resource dynamics are processed internally through reflection

Aspects and Orb Theory
OOI = Effect:
“Orb of influence equals effect.”
FCA = Rulership:
“Fusion cusp areas work with [rulerships].”
Conjunction in FCA:
“If two planets are both within the fusion cusp area… they’re also conjunct… two pulls in three and three pulls in two? Like, depending on vantage? Correct. Yes. And then obviously they also work together. Right. On top of that.”
Interpretation:
 When multiple planets conjunct in FCA:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * Each planet blends both houses
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * Planets also blend WITH each other
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * Creates complex, intensified, multi-directional energy

Distance = Time
Core Concept:
“Distance is time in astrology. I don’t know if i’ve taught this before but distance is time. So the closer two planets are, the sooner they’ll interact with each other, the sooner they’ll interact with transits. The further they get away, even within the same energy, the more time will pass before that second thing kicks in.”
Application:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * Planets close in degree (e.g., 28° and 29°): Immediate, simultaneous interaction
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * Planets far apart (e.g., 2° and 17°): Sequential, time-delayed manifestation
Example from Reading:
“Well first off it’s you know what 17 or so degrees away. Well what is 17 degrees away? First off I know that it means two separate decans but I also know that distance is time in astrology.”
Real-Life Manifestation:
“For you, it’s more like I get in the relationship and then I find out, oh shit, I need to fix this. Exactly. Right. The time passes between those two. It’s in the same energy. There might be red flags or yellow flags or whatever along the way, but it happens later. And then it becomes a big thing and a big focus of your life.”

PART 12: TIMING CONSIDERATIONS
Transits Through FCA
Experience of Transition:
“And if any of you guys have gone through your progressions, when something hits 28 and a half degrees, it feels like 29 degrees. It feels like 29 and a half degrees. You’re sitting there like this needs to end. You feel that. You feel that other energy creeping in. You’re like, ‘I’m ready to move on.’”
Why It Feels This Way:
“It’s not necessarily the orb of influence. Like that’s definitely reaching into the next, but it doesn’t— the reason why it feels like you’re supposed to be in the next energy is because you are in the next energy, right? When you hit 28 and a half degrees, the other energy seeping in, you’re in it. You’re in that mix. So it’s a transition time.”
________________


Progressions vs. Natal Charts
Key Distinction:
“So it’s a transition time. But if it’s in your natal chart, you can’t always be transitioning. The planets aren’t moving. It’s a snapshot. So you’re blending at that point.”
Interpretation Difference:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * Progressions/Transits: Temporary transition period (moving through FCA)
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * Natal Chart: Permanent blending (born with planet in FCA)
Natal FCA:
 People with natal planets in FCA don’t experience “transition”—they live in the blend constantly.

PART 13: ADVANCED EDGE CASES
Multiple Planets in FCA
Scenario: Two+ planets both in FCA, possibly conjunct
Interpretation:
“So this one is not in the fusion cusp area. This one is in the fusion cusp area. Okay. So because it’s 28 and a half to one and a half. So these three, but they are conjunct. So you have to break this down piece by piece. And this is where, when you’re looking at these things, it becomes a bit more intricate.”
Process:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          1. Identify each planet separately

Apply FCA blending to each individually
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          3. Then assess conjunction between them
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          4. Result: Layered, complex, multi-directional energy flow
Example:
“Two pulls, so the planet there, like, two pulls in three and three pulls in two? Like, depending on vantage? Correct. Yes. And then obviously they also work together. Right. On top of that.”

Angles in FCA
Ascendant Example:
“In terms of the ascendant, you do the same exact thing. The ascendant is your motivations… the ascendant would be—your motivations would be blended in with value.”
Rule:
 Treat angles (Asc, MC, Desc, IC) exactly like planets for FCA purposes.
Manifestation:
 If Ascendant in FCA between 1st/2nd:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * Identity becomes tied to material value

Nodes in FCA
Special Considerations:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          1. Always reference Moon (nodes derive from lunar motion)
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          2. Both houses active (North Node growth involves both)
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          3. Order matters (if conjunct other planets, determine sequence)
Carly’s Example:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * North Node + Chiron both in FCA (8th/9th)
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * Order: Chiron → North Node
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * Meaning: “Feed your insecurities… into what you’re supposed to grow into emotionally”

PART 14: COMMON MISTAKES AND CORRECTIONS
Mistake 1: “I Was Born on a Cusp”
Correction:
“And then it was a combination of everybody being like, ‘I was born on a cusp. No, you weren’t. You were born near a cusp.’”
Truth:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * You’re only “on a cusp” if in FCA (28.5° to 1.5° range)
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * Even then, you’re not “both signs”—you’re one sign with blending
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * House/sign belonging is determined by cusp line, not degree proximity
________________


Mistake 2: Applying OOI Like FCA
Error:
 Reading Mars at 27° as if Sun is a secondary ruler.
Correction:
“Not really. You’re not ever going to use the sun as a secondary ruler for Mars. Mars is going to stay. Its ruler is the moon. It is only reaching into the next energy. It is not mixed with it.”
________________


Mistake 3: Reversing Retrograde Logic
Error:
 “If Mercury retrograde is at 29° in 7th, does it pull from 8th down into 7th?”
Correction:
“No, you’re still going to read it exactly the same, but you’re going to apply on the planet level. You’re going to apply the properties of the retrograde.”
Retrograde affects how the planet expresses, not which direction energy flows.
________________


Mistake 4: Ignoring Decans
Note:
“And then obviously, you would look at the Deccan and say, ‘You know, how does the Deccan apply?’”
Decans (10° divisions) still matter even in FCA—add another layer of nuance.
________________


Mistake 5: Over-Extending Blending
Error:
 Treating planets at 25° as if they’re in FCA.
Clarification:
“Technically, technically, if we’re using a strict 28… but these two are conjunct anyway. So you have a similar influence. It’s just not as heavy, so to speak.”
28.5° is the threshold—don’t extend FCA earlier unless there’s compelling reason (e.g., conjunction with planet in FCA).

2. Planet Info Panels:
MARS at 29°50' Cancer (1st House) - IN FCA


Primary House: 1st (Self, Identity, Body)
Secondary House: 2nd (Value, Money, Possessions)


Primary Ruler: Moon (Cancer)
  └─ Moon in Sagittarius, 5th House


Secondary Ruler: Sun (Leo) ⚡ BLENDING ACTIVE
  └─ Sun in Aries, 10th House


Interpretation:
Your actions (Mars) express through emotional/nurturing energy (Cancer/1st house) 
BUT ALSO simultaneously influence your values and material resources (Leo/2nd house). 
This creates intensified drive where self-expression is directly tied to financial 
recognition. Both the Moon and Sun placements must be considered for full picture.

Interpretation Logic (Decision Tree)
FOR each planet/point:
  │
  ├─ Get exact degree (including arc minutes)
  │
  ├─ Determine house (by cusp line)
  │
  ├─ Calculate distance from next house cusp
  │
  ├─ Is degree >= 28.5° OR <= 1.5°? 
  │  │
  │  ├─ YES → FCA
  │  │  │
  │  │  ├─ Assign primary house/sign
  │  │  ├─ Assign secondary house/sign (next)
  │  │  ├─ Get primary ruler
  │  │  ├─ Get secondary ruler ⚡
  │  │  ├─ Generate BLENDING interpretation
  │  │  └─ Flag: IsInFCA = TRUE
  │  │
  │  └─ NO → Check OOI
  │     │
  │     ├─ Get planet's orb (e.g., Mars=4°)
  │     ├─ Does (degree + orb) reach next cusp?
  │     │  │
  │     │  ├─ YES → OOI
  │     │  │  │
  │     │  │  ├─ Assign primary house/sign
  │     │  │  ├─ Note influence on next house (NO blending)
  │     │  │  ├─ Get primary ruler ONLY
  │     │  │  ├─ Generate EXTENSION interpretation
  │     │  │  └─ Flag: IsInOOI = TRUE
  │     │  │
  │     │  └─ NO → Standard Placement
  │     │     │
  │     │     ├─ Assign house/sign
  │     │     ├─ Get primary ruler ONLY
  │     │     ├─ Generate standard interpretation
  │     │     └─ Flags: IsInFCA = FALSE, IsInOOI = FALSE
  │
  ├─ Check retrograde status
  │  └─ If retrograde, modify interpretation (internalize themes)
  │
  ├─ Check aspects
  │  └─ If conjunct another planet IN FCA → COMPLEX BLENDING
  │
  ├─ Layer additional factors (decans, etc.)

“If You Can’t Prove It…”
Core Mandate:
“If you can’t prove it, it’s not good for me. And that’s just how I view things because I just need to be, if I’m going to show up and be like, this is what this means, I better back that ish up. That’s how I feel. And if I can’t prove myself, I’m a washout.”

Energy as Fluid, Not Fixed
Gradient Philosophy:
“It’s energy. It pulsates. It’s fluid. It’s malleable. It’s just like light. If you shine two lights next to each other, you’re going to have spill off in the middle.”
Implications:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         * Energy doesn’t “snap” from one sign/house to another

Layering Over Dispositorship
Critique of Traditional Method:
“Dispositorship was weird, but I liked what they were trying to do. I just thought you’re skipping a lot of things along the way.”
Layering Solution:
“Layer it one layer at a time. Figure out what this means before you move on.”
Why Layering Works Better:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         1.

When to Stop Digging
Question:
“How do we know where to stop? Intuition.”
Answer:
“You stop when you get an answer. Right. The problem is that most people want to keep going and digging to see where else it leads. But if I’ve already got my answer, I don’t care where the rest of it leads unless I seriously need more detail.”

PART 17: CLOSING INSIGHTS
Instructor’s Summary
“If we are done here, I’m going to end this webinar, I think. Like I said, this isn’t that complicated. It’s 1133. It’s a good time to end. This isn’t a super complicated technique, but it is an important one that no one else discusses. 29 degrees, even as an anaeretic degree in other systems of astrology is just supposedly more important, but they don’t tell you why. And they don’t mix it with the next house.”
Key Distinction:
“And that is the difference between fusion cusp areas and like critical degrees. It’s not just about that hyper focus point. It’s the fact that in that point, you have a blur, a blending of energies through, like I said, like gradient spill off. That is pulling energies from the next house in. And that’s actually where the intensity comes from is that it’s mixing with energies that are in addition to those energies of that specific house.”
Closing:
“So thank you guys all for being a part of this webinar. And I will see y’all in Mystic Circle. Vibe higher, y’all. Deuces.”

PART 18: KEY QUOTES FOR APP INTEGRATION
Technical Quotes
“Fusion Cusp Area, which is from 28.5 degrees to 1.5 degrees of the next sign.”
“Mars has a four-degree orb of influence… it’s already reaching into the next sign and then it’s not at 28 and a half. So this would be an example of it sitting within the orb of influence, it’s reaching into the next sign, but not within the fusion cusperia.”
“The house ‘belonging’ is determined by the side of the cusp/houselines, not merely by degree proximity.”
“Orb of influence equals effect. Fusion cusp areas work with [rulerships].”
Interpretation Quotes
“The main difference between those is whether or not the energies of the next sign are encapsulating the energies of the previous planet.”
“You’re not ever going to use the sun as a secondary ruler for Mars. Mars is going to stay. Its ruler is the moon. It is only reaching into the next energy. It is not mixed with it.”
“You’re reading the moon as the primary ruler because it is definitively in the first house. But because it’s in that fusion cuspary, it’s blending the energies of the second house. And as a result, the sun becomes a second ruler.”
“Distance is time in astrology.”
Philosophical Quotes
“If you can’t prove it, it’s not good for me.”
“Layer it one layer at a time. Figure out what this means before you move on.”
“You stop when you get an answer.”

SUMMARY FOR DEVELOPERS
Transcript 18: FCA vs OOI Cusp Webinar provides the most technically precise treatment of house/sign cusp dynamics in Alchemistic Astrology. Key implementation requirements:
Critical Rules:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         1. FCA = 28.5° to 1.5° (strict threshold)
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         2. FCA triggers secondary ruler (OOI does not)
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         3. House belonging = cusp line (not degree proximity)
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         4. Blending (FCA) ≠ Extension (OOI)
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         5. Retrograde affects planet, not house blend
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         6. Distance = time for aspect manifestation
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         7.

Why This Matters:
FCA/OOI distinction fundamentally changes interpretation. A planet at 27° vs. 29°50’ in the same sign can have drastically different life manifestations due to blending effects. This is not a “nice to have” feature—it’s core to accurate Alchemistic Astrology readings.

I. OPENING REMARKS & CLASS CONTEXT
What is Astrocartography?
Astrocartography, also known as astrogeography or relocation astrology, is the practice of mapping “your energies everywhere else in the world.” As the instructor explains, it’s fundamentally about understanding how your natal chart’s planetary energies manifest differently depending on geographic location.




Core Definition (Verbatim):
“Astrocartography is mapping your energies everywhere else in the world. It shows where your planets conjunct the four angles—Ascendant, Descendant, Midheaven, and IC—across the globe.”
This technique allows individuals to understand which locations on Earth will activate specific planetary energies in their chart, providing practical guidance for:

Historical & Practical Context
Astrocartography emerged as a specialized branch of astrology in the late 20th century, offering a practical application of astrological principles to real-world geographic decisions. Unlike traditional natal chart interpretation which assumes a fixed location, astrocartography recognizes that:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         1. Your natal chart is calculated for your birth location only
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         2. Different locations activate different chart dynamics
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         3. The same birth moment produces different angular alignments globally
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         4. Geographic location can be strategically used for personal development
The instructor emphasizes that this is not about finding a “perfect” location, but rather about understanding which places align with specific goals, life phases, or developmental needs.

“There’s no such thing as a perfect place; there are places that align with goals.”

II. FOUNDATIONAL CONCEPTS & ASTRONOMICAL BASIS
The Four Angles: Foundation of Astrocartography
Astrocartography is built entirely on the concept of angular planets—planets that conjunct one of the four major chart angles. Understanding these angles is essential to interpreting astrocartography maps.
1. Ascendant (ASC) - Eastern Horizon
Astronomical Definition: The degree of the zodiac rising on the eastern horizon at the moment of birth (or at any given moment in time).
Astrological Significance:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         * Emotional foundation
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         * Where you retreat and find safety
On an Astrocartography Map: A planetary line indicates where that planet was at the lowest point in the sky (anticulminating) at your birth moment.
Practical Interpretation: Locations on your IC lines will activate that planet’s energy in your private life, home environment, and internal foundation. This affects your domestic life, emotional security, and what happens in private spaces.
How Astrocartography Maps Are Generated
Technical Process:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         1. Start with natal chart data: Birth date, exact time, birth location
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         2. Calculate planetary positions: Where each planet was in the zodiac at birth moment
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         3. Project globally: For every location on Earth, calculate where those planets would appear relative to the four angles
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         4. Draw lines: Map lines where each planet conjuncts each angle
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         5. Result: A world map with planetary lines showing angular conjunctions
Key Technical Principle:
“Your natal chart never changes, but the angles change based on location. Astrocartography shows where your existing planetary energies become angular—and therefore more prominent—in different places.”

III. TECHNICAL RULES & CORE PRINCIPLES
Principle #1: The Natal Chart is Never Lost
Critical Understanding: When you relocate, you do NOT lose your natal chart. Your birth chart remains your foundational blueprint regardless of where you live or travel.
Verbatim Teaching:
“Your natal chart is always there. Relocation just adds a layer—it doesn’t replace anything. You’re still fundamentally who you were born to be.”
What This Means:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         * All natal chart placements remain active
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         * Natal aspects continue to operate
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         * Core personality and karmic patterns persist
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         * Relocation layers new angular emphasis on top of natal foundation
Practical Implication: When interpreting relocated charts or astrocartography lines, always reference back to the natal chart. A relocated chart amplifies or activates certain natal potentials; it doesn’t create entirely new ones.
Principle #2: Distance = Orb (Variable by Planet)
One of the most misunderstood aspects of astrocartography is orb—how close you need to be to a planetary line for it to be active.
Critical Rule: Orb in astrocartography is NOT measured in fixed miles or kilometers. It’s measured in degrees, and the degree range varies by planet.
Orb Guidelines by Planet:
Luminaries (Wider Orbs):
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         * Sun: 6-8° orb
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         * Moon: 2-3° orb (despite being a luminary, Moon has a tighter orb due to speed)

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         * Faster-moving planets (Mercury, Moon) have tighter orbs because their influence is more personal and immediate
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         * The Sun has a wide orb due to its central importance as the life force
Practical Application:
 When looking at an astrocartography map, a city doesn’t need to be exactly on a planetary line. If it falls within that planet’s orb range (in degrees of latitude), the line is active for that location.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         * What stays the same: All planetary positions, all aspects between planets, all zodiac sign placements

Relationship Between Them:
 An astrocartography line tells you which planet would be angular if you relocated to that area. The relocated chart for that location would show the details of how that angular planet integrates with your natal chart.
Verbatim Teaching:
“The map shows you the big picture—where energies are. The relocated chart shows you the details—how those energies work in a specific place.”
Principle #4: Paran Lines (Crossing Points)
Definition: Paran lines (also called crossing lines) are locations where two or more planetary lines intersect.
Astronomical Basis: At these geographic coordinates, multiple planets are simultaneously angular—conjunct different angles at the same location.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         * Your Jupiter MC line crosses your Venus Ascendant line in Paris
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         * In Paris, Jupiter is at your Midheaven AND Venus is at your Ascendant simultaneously
Interpretation Principle:
 Paran points create combined effects—the energies of both planets work together in that location. This can be:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         * Harmonious: If the planets naturally work well together (e.g., Venus-Jupiter)
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         * Challenging: If the planets have inherent tension (e.g., Saturn-Uranus)
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         * Complex: If the planets represent different life areas requiring integration (e.g., Mars-Neptune)
Practical Consideration:
 Paran points are often more significant than single lines because they represent concentrated, multi-dimensional activation. Cities at paran points tend to be particularly impactful locations in someone’s life.
Principle #5: Local Space vs. Astrocartography
The instructor clarifies an important distinction that’s often confused in astrological practice.
Astrocartography (What We’re Studying):
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         * Based on angles (ASC, DSC, MC, IC)
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         * Shows where planets conjunct these angles globally
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         * Lines run primarily north-south (with some curvature based on Earth’s geometry)
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         * Interpretation focuses on angular planet meanings
Local Space Astrology (Different Technique):
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         * Based on compass directions from your current location
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         * Shows in which cardinal direction (N, S, E, W, NE, etc.) each planet sits from where you are
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         * Creates radial lines from your location outward

Verbatim Clarification:
“Local Space is about direction from where you are now. Astrocartography is about where planets are angular on Earth. They’re related but not the same thing. Don’t confuse them in your app.”
App Development Note: These should be separate features in the application, as they use different calculation methods and provide different types of insight.

IV. PLANETARY LINE INTERPRETATIONS - COMPLETE BREAKDOWN
Interpretive Framework
When interpreting planetary lines in astrocartography, use this layered approach:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         1. Identify the planet: What archetypal energy is being activated?
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         2. Identify the angle: Where in life is this energy showing up? (Identity/relationships/career/home)
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         3. Reference the natal chart: What house does this planet rule natally? What aspects does it make?
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         4. Consider the purpose: What is the person trying to accomplish or develop?
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         5. Assess timing: Is this a temporary visit or permanent relocation?
Universal Principle:
“No line is inherently ‘good’ or ‘bad.’ Every planetary energy can be productive or destructive depending on how you work with it and what you’re trying to accomplish.”

Instructor’s Personal Example (Verbatim):
“I lived on my Pluto IC line in Tampa. It was the most transformative time of my life—intense, dark at times, but I came out completely regenerated. My home life was where all my shadow work happened. It wasn’t easy, but it was necessary. That’s Pluto IC—deep transformation at your roots.”

V. PRACTICAL EXAMPLES & CASE STUDIES
Instructor’s Personal Astrocartography Experiences
The instructor shared extensive personal examples throughout the class, providing real-world validation of astrocartography principles.
Tampa, Florida: Pluto IC Line
Context: The instructor lived in Tampa for a significant period, which falls on his Pluto IC line.
Experience (Verbatim):
“Tampa was my Pluto IC line, and wow, was it intense. Everything about my home life, my private foundation, my sense of roots—all of it went through this death and rebirth cycle. I dealt with deep family stuff, ancestral patterns, and my own shadow in ways I never had before. It was dark at times, isolating, but I came out completely transformed at my core. That’s what Pluto IC does—it regenerates you from the foundation up.”

Los Angeles, California: Beneficial Squares
Context: The instructor discussed his time in Los Angeles, which is not directly on a planetary line but receives beneficial square aspects from certain lines.
Experience (Verbatim):
“LA wasn’t on any of my major lines directly, but it squared some beneficial planets in my chart. I found it gave me this productive drive—not overwhelming like a direct line, but this energizing push that kept me motivated and working. Squares in astrocartography can actually be really productive. They give you something to work with, a friction that creates movement without overwhelming you.”

Instructor’s Analysis (Verbatim):
“Boulder is interesting for you because you’ve got Jupiter and Pluto both activated there. Jupiter will bring opportunities, growth, possibly educational opportunities—Boulder is a college town, that fits. But Pluto means it won’t be light and easy. There will be deep transformation work happening, probably around whatever Jupiter is trying to expand. So yes, go if you want growth, but know it’s going to be intense growth, transformative growth. Jupiter-Pluto together is like… becoming powerful through expansion, but you have to face your shadow to get there.”

Maria: Progressions and Relocation Timing
Question: Maria asked whether she should wait for a progressed Moon change before relocating.
Instructor’s Response (Verbatim):
“Progressions and astrocartography work together but on different timescales. Your astrocartography shows WHERE certain energies are activated geographically. Your progressions show WHEN certain internal developments are happening. You can use both—for example, if your progressed Moon is moving into a new house, you might choose a relocation that supports that house’s themes. But you don’t have to wait. The geographic energy is always there; it’s just about whether you’re ready internally to work with it. Sometimes the relocation itself helps trigger the internal development.”

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         * Eventually found authentic relating style
Key Lesson: “Uranus lines bring freedom and awakening, but also instability. This client got what they asked for—awakening through relationship—but it came through sudden change and loss, not through stability.”

VI. TRAVEL VS. RELOCATION: KEY DISTINCTIONS
Temporary Travel on Planetary Lines
Core Principle: You don’t have to permanently relocate to experience a planetary line’s energy. Temporary travel can activate lines for shorter-term experiences.
How Travel Activates Lines
Duration Considerations:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         * Short trips (1-7 days): Taste of the energy, often surface-level experience
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         * Medium stays (1-3 months): Significant activation, enough time to work with energy
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         * Long stays (3+ months): Nearly equivalent to relocation, deep integration
Intensity Factors:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         1. Proximity to exact line (within orb or not)
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         2. Duration of stay
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         3. Intention and awareness (consciously working with energy vs. passive experience)
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         4. Natal chart sensitivity (some people are more responsive to location shifts)
Strategic Travel Applications
Example Use Cases:
1. Testing a Relocation:
“If you’re considering moving somewhere, visit first. Spend a month there if possible. See how the energy feels before committing to a permanent move.”
2. Temporary Energy Boost:
“Need motivation? Visit your Mars ASC line for a week. Need inspiration? Visit your Neptune ASC line. You can ‘borrow’ the energy temporarily without living there.”
3. Specific Project Support:
“Writing a book? Visit your Mercury MC line while working on it. Doing deep psychological work? Spend time on your Pluto IC line during intensive therapy.”
4. Relationship Development:
“Want to deepen a relationship? Take your partner to your Venus DSC line or their Venus DSC line for a romantic trip.”
Permanent Relocation Considerations
Critical Questions Before Relocating:
1. What is your goal?
Match the planetary line energy to your actual life goal. Don’t move somewhere because it “sounds good” astrologically—move because the energy supports a real objective.
Questions to Ask:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         * What do I want to develop or achieve?
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         * Which planetary energy supports that goal?
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         * Am I willing to work with this planet’s challenges?
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         * Is this the right timing in my life for this energy?
2. What is your natal relationship to that planet?
Critical Principle (Verbatim):
“Your relocated chart doesn’t create new potential—it activates what’s already in your natal chart. If you have a difficult Saturn natally, a Saturn line will still be difficult. You need to work with your natal chart dynamics, not against them.”

VII. REMOTE ACTIVATION & MODERN APPLICATIONS
Remote Activation Principle
One of the most significant modern developments in astrocartography practice is the concept of remote activation—accessing planetary line energies without physically traveling to or living in those locations.
Core Concept (Verbatim):
“You don’t necessarily have to physically be somewhere to access that energy. In our modern, connected world, you can work remotely with people in that location, do business there, have relationships there, study institutions there—and you’ll activate some of that line’s energy without moving.”
Methods of Remote Activation
1. Remote Work/Business
Application: Working for a company located on one of your beneficial lines, or having clients/business operations in that region.
Example Scenarios:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         * Mercury MC line in New York: Work remotely for a New York-based communications company from anywhere

Limitations of Remote Activation
Important Caveats:
1. Not a Complete Substitute:
 Remote activation provides access to some energy, but it’s not equivalent to physical presence. Physical relocation creates deeper, more comprehensive integration.
2. IC Lines Especially Difficult to Activate Remotely:
 IC (home/roots) lines require physical presence more than other angles. You cannot truly activate IC energy without being in the location—home is inherently physical.
3. Requires Intentional Engagement:
 Passive connection doesn’t activate energy. You must actively and intentionally engage with the location/people/culture.
4. Works Best for MC and DSC Lines:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         * MC (career): Easily activated through remote work

IX. ADVANCED CONCEPTS & INTEGRATION
Integration with Natal Chart Dynamics
Core Principle: Astrocartography does not exist in isolation. Every relocated chart or planetary line must be interpreted in the context of the natal chart.
Natal Rulerships
Critical Teaching (Verbatim):
“When a planet becomes angular in a relocated chart, it brings its natal house rulerships with it. You can’t separate them. If your Mercury rules your 3rd and 6th houses natally, and you move to a Mercury MC line, your career will involve 3rd house themes (communication, learning, siblings) and 6th house themes (service, health, daily work). Always trace back to natal rulers.”
Application Process:
Step 1: Identify angular planet in relocated chart
Step 2: Determine what houses that planet rules in natal chart
Step 3: Interpret how those natal house themes manifest in the relocated angle position
Example:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         * Natal Chart: Venus rules 2nd house (money, values) and 7th house (partnerships)
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         * Relocation: Move to Venus MC line (Venus on Midheaven)
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         * Integration: Career (MC) will involve money/values (2nd house) and partnerships/relationships (7th house)
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         * Possible Manifestations: Career as relationship counselor, financial advisor for couples, partnership-based business, career dependent on beauty/aesthetics
Natal Aspects
Critical Teaching (Verbatim):
“Your natal aspects travel with you. If you have natal Mars square Saturn, and you move to a Mars MC line, you’ll still be dealing with that Mars-Saturn square—it just becomes more prominent in your career. You can’t escape challenging aspects by relocating. You can only change WHERE they show up in your life.”
Application Process:
Step 1: Identify angular planet in relocated chart
Step 2: List all natal aspects that planet makes
Step 3: Interpret how those aspects color the relocated experience
Example:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         * Natal Chart: Sun conjunct Neptune (idealistic, spiritual, potentially confused identity)
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         * Relocation: Move to Sun ASC line (Sun on Ascendant)
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         * Integration: Identity (ASC) will be idealistic, spiritual, potentially confused (Sun-Neptune)
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         * Manifestation: May appear mystical or unclear to others, spiritual identity emphasized, need to balance idealism with groundedness
Combination Effects: Multiple Lines Active
When multiple planetary lines are active in a location (paran points or overlapping orbs), the energies combine in complex ways.

Instructor Guidance on Timing (Verbatim):
“Don’t overcomplicate timing. If the location is right for your goals and your natal chart supports the planetary energies there, you can move. Yes, transits matter, but don’t wait years for the ‘perfect’ transit. Life is happening now. Sometimes the move itself creates the right timing internally. Trust that.”
Business Location Strategy
Selecting Business Locations Based on Astrocartography
Different Considerations Than Personal Relocation:
1. Business Entity Chart:
 Some astrologers use the business founding chart (incorporation date/time/location) as the basis for business astrocartography, rather than the owner’s natal chart.
Instructor’s Perspective (Verbatim):
“I prefer using the owner’s natal chart for business location, especially for sole proprietors or small businesses. The business is an extension of you. Your energies in different places will affect how the business operates. For larger corporations with many stakeholders, you might consider the incorporation chart, but for most of you, use your chart.”

Psychological Considerations
Shadow Work on Challenging Lines
Philosophy (Verbatim):
“Sometimes the location you need isn’t the location that feels good. If you have major shadow work to do, a Pluto line might be exactly where you should go—not because it’ll be easy, but because it’ll force you to face what you need to face. Don’t always run from challenging lines. Sometimes they’re the medicine.”
When to Choose Challenging Lines:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         * Consciously seeking transformation
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         * Ready to face specific shadows or patterns
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         * Have support systems in place

When to Avoid Challenging Lines:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         * Already in crisis or instability

The “Grass is Greener” Trap
Warning About Relocation as Escape:
Instructor’s Caution (Verbatim):
“Astrocartography is not about running away from your problems. Your problems are in your natal chart, and your natal chart goes with you everywhere. Relocation changes WHERE and HOW your chart’s energies manifest, but it doesn’t erase your challenges. If you’re trying to escape yourself, no line on Earth will help you. You have to do the internal work.”
Healthy Relocation Mindset:

X. PHILOSOPHICAL FOUNDATIONS & CLOSING WISDOM
Core Philosophical Principles
1. No Perfect Place
Fundamental Truth (Verbatim):
“There is no perfect place. Every location has gifts and challenges. The question is not ‘Where is perfect for me?’ but rather ‘Where aligns with what I’m trying to develop right now?’ Your needs will change throughout life, and so will your ideal locations.”
Implication:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         * Release perfectionism about location
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         * Match location to current life phase and goals
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         * Accept that different life stages may call for different locations
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         * Understand that trade-offs exist everywhere
2. Geography as Tool, Not Destiny
Empowerment Perspective (Verbatim):
“Astrocartography is a tool, not a prison. It shows you where certain energies are more available or activated, but you still have free will. You can work with challenging lines consciously. You can choose to stay somewhere that’s not ‘ideal’ astrologically because other life factors matter. Don’t let astrology override your common sense or personal circumstances.”

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         * Practical life factors (family, career, finances) matter too
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         * Conscious work can make any location functional
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         * Free will and awareness are more powerful than geographic determinism
3. Evolution Through Place
Growth Perspective (Verbatim):
“Different places develop different parts of you. You might need a Mars MC location for a few years to build your career drive, then a Neptune IC location to develop your spirituality, then a Venus ASC location to work on relationships. We’re complex beings with many facets to develop. Don’t expect one place to serve all your needs forever.”

4. Integration Over Escape
Maturity Principle (Verbatim):
“The goal is integration. Wherever you are, whatever energies are activated, your job is to integrate them consciously. Even a ‘good’ line can be destructive if you use it unconsciously. Even a ‘hard’ line can be profound medicine if you work with it consciously. It’s not about the line—it’s about you.”

Instructor’s Closing Wisdom
Final Teaching (Verbatim):
“Astrocartography gives you a map. It shows you where certain energies of your natal chart become more prominent. Use it wisely. Don’t let it make you afraid of places or think you can only live in certain locations. You’re more powerful than your chart. You’re more powerful than geography. But if you can align geography with your conscious growth intentions, you’ll have a powerful ally. Use astrocartography to support your path, not to limit it.”

Astrocartography maps show where natal planets conjunct the four angles globally
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         2. Relocated charts recalculate angles for specific locations while keeping planetary positions
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         3. Orbs vary by planet (not fixed distance)
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         4. Paran points (line intersections) are especially significant
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         5. Interpretation must integrate natal chart dynamics (rulerships, aspects)

Remote activation is possible but not equivalent to physical relocation
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         5. Timing considerations (transits/progressions) support but don’t dictate relocation
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         6. Business location strategy differs from personal relocation

Interpretive Summary
Aries energy represents the initiating force—the spark that begins action, the first impulse, the pioneering drive. As the first sign, it embodies beginnings, the physical act of starting, and the courage to move forward into the unknown. Ruled by Mars and associated with the 1st house of self and identity, Aries is fundamentally about assertion of will and the physical manifestation of desire into action.
The Fire element provides passion and enthusiasm; the Cardinal modality provides initiating force. Aries doesn’t sustain or complete—it starts. The themes reflect this: competition (being first), aggression (assertive force), conflict (necessary friction to initiate), and pioneering (going where none have gone).

Interpretive Summary
Taurus energy represents stabilization and valuation—the process of assessing worth, accumulating resources, and establishing comfort and security. Ruled by Venus and associated with the 2nd house, Taurus is fundamentally about what we value and possess, both materially and in terms of self-worth.
The Earth element grounds Taurus in the physical and tangible; the Fixed modality creates staying power and resistance to change. Taurus doesn’t initiate or change—it maintains and sustains. The themes reflect this: possessions (what we own), comfort (stability and security), food (physical sustenance), and talents (personal resources).
The inclusion of “Throat” reflects Taurus’ anatomical association with the throat chakra—both the physical throat and the metaphorical “voice” of one’s values.

Interpretive Summary
Gemini energy represents connection and communication—the mental processes of gathering information, making connections, and exchanging ideas. Ruled by Mercury and associated with the 3rd house, Gemini is fundamentally about how we think, learn, and communicate within our immediate environment.
The Air element provides mental agility and conceptual thinking; the Mutable modality provides adaptability and flexibility. Gemini doesn’t commit or deepen—it connects and circulates. The themes reflect this: siblings (first peer relationships), communication (exchange of information), thoughts & ideas (mental content), local (immediate environment), and learning (information acquisition).
The designation “Mind (Inner)” distinguishes Gemini’s internal mental processing from Virgo’s “Mind (Outward)” analytical application.
The inclusion of “Eyes & Hands” reflects Gemini’s anatomical associations with the tools of perception and manipulation—seeing and doing.

Interpretive Summary
Cancer energy represents emotional security and nurturing—the need for safety, the instinct to care, and the creation of protective environments. Ruled by the Moon and associated with the 4th house, Cancer is fundamentally about emotional foundation and belonging.
The Water element provides emotional depth and fluidity; the Cardinal modality provides initiating protective action. Cancer doesn’t just feel—it responds emotionally and protectively. The themes reflect this: mother & family (primary nurturing relationships), house & home (physical emotional sanctuary), private (protected inner space), and ancestry (emotional roots and lineage).
The inclusion of agricultural and land themes reflects Cancer’s connection to nourishment and cultivation—both literally (food production) and metaphorically (emotional cultivation and growth).

Interpretive Summary
Leo energy represents radiant self-expression and life force—the celebration of existence, the need for recognition, and the joy of creative expression. Ruled by the Sun and associated with the 5th house, Leo is fundamentally about vital expression of self and purpose.
The Fire element provides warmth and life-giving energy; the Fixed modality provides sustained radiance. Leo doesn’t just exist—it shines and celebrates existence. The themes reflect this: validation (recognition of worth), celebration (joy in being), expression (creative outpouring), and leadership (confident self-direction).
The inclusion of “Father” and “Children” reflects Leo’s generative quality—both receiving life force (father as source) and creating/expressing it (children as expression). “Young Age” reflects the childlike quality of unselfconscious joy and play.
“Risk” appears as a key attribute because authentic self-expression requires vulnerability—the willingness to be seen and potentially judged.

Interpretive Summary
Virgo energy represents refinement and practical application—the analytical process of improving, organizing, and making useful. Ruled by Mercury (like Gemini) and associated with the 6th house, Virgo is fundamentally about practical mental application and service.
The Earth element grounds Virgo’s mental energy in tangible reality; the Mutable modality provides adaptability in service and analysis. Virgo doesn’t just think—it analyzes and refines. The themes reflect this: critique (analytical discernment), details (precision focus), efficiency (optimization), and utility (practical usefulness).
The designation “Mind (Outward)” distinguishes Virgo’s externally-applied analytical thinking from Gemini’s “Mind (Inner)” information gathering. Where Gemini gathers and connects, Virgo sorts and applies.
“Health” appears prominently because Virgo’s refining quality extends to the body—maintaining physical systems, optimizing function, and addressing imbalances.

Interpretive Summary
Libra energy represents relationship and aesthetic harmony—the creation of balance, the art of connection, and the appreciation of beauty. Ruled by Venus (like Taurus) and associated with the 7th house, Libra is fundamentally about relationship with other and appreciation of beauty in interaction.
The Air element provides mental perspective and objectivity; the Cardinal modality provides initiating relational action. Libra doesn’t just appreciate—it actively creates harmony and connection. The themes reflect this: relationships (primary other-connection), mediation (creating balance between opposing forces), conversation (exchange and reciprocity), and aesthetics (beauty in form and relationship).
The designation “Value (Outward)” distinguishes Libra’s relational valuation from Taurus’ “Value (Self)” personal worth assessment. Where Taurus values what it possesses, Libra values what relates harmoniously.
“Hormones” appears as a theme reflecting Libra’s connection to attraction, partnership chemistry, and the biological dimension of relationship.
“Legal Matters” reflects Libra’s association with justice, fairness, and contractual relationships—the formal structures of balance and reciprocity.

Interpretive Summary
Scorpio energy represents depth, intensity, and transformation—the process of dying and being reborn, the exploration of what’s hidden, and the power that comes from facing darkness. Ruled by Pluto (modern) or Mars (traditional) and associated with the 8th house, Scorpio is fundamentally about transformation through depth and intensity.
The Water element provides emotional intensity and depth; the Fixed modality provides sustained transformative power. Scorpio doesn’t change quickly—it transforms completely through sustained intensity. The themes reflect this: transformation (death and rebirth), darkness (shadow and hidden realms), intimacy (deep merging), decay & poop (elimination and purification), and secrecy (what’s hidden and protected).
The unflinching inclusion of taboo themes (“Decay & Poop,” “Kinks,” “Crime & Mystery”) reflects Scorpio’s association with what society hides, represses, or considers inappropriate. Scorpio energy goes where others fear to go.
“Reproductive” appears not just as biological sexuality but as the generative power of transformation—death gives birth to new life.

Interpretive Summary
Sagittarius energy represents expansion and seeking—the quest for meaning, the exploration of possibilities, and the accumulation of experience and wisdom. Ruled by Jupiter and associated with the 9th house, Sagittarius is fundamentally about growth through exploration and the search for truth.
The Fire element provides enthusiasm and vision; the Mutable modality provides flexibility and adaptability in the search. Sagittarius doesn’t settle—it constantly expands horizons. The themes reflect this: exploration (seeking beyond known boundaries), foreign (what’s distant and different), philosophy (seeking meaning and truth), adventure (experience-gathering), and wisdom (integrated understanding from experience).
“Hypotheticals” and “Story” reflect Sagittarius’ orientation toward possibility and narrative meaning—not just what is, but what could be, and the story that makes experience meaningful.
“Distance” appears both literally (foreign travel, far places) and metaphorically (philosophical distance, big-picture perspective).

Interpretive Summary
Capricorn energy represents structure, achievement, and mastery—the building of lasting forms, the climb toward goals, and the discipline required for excellence. Ruled by Saturn and associated with the 10th house, Capricorn is fundamentally about mastery through time, effort, and structure.
The Earth element grounds Capricorn in tangible achievement; the Cardinal modality provides initiating ambition and goal-setting. Capricorn doesn’t dream—it builds methodically toward concrete achievement. The themes reflect this: achievement (reaching goals through effort), tradition (tested structures that endure), authority (earned leadership), discipline (sustained effort), and construction (building that lasts).
“Time” is central to Capricorn—understanding that mastery requires time, that some things cannot be rushed, that endurance over time creates authority.
“Consequence” reflects Capricorn’s realistic understanding that actions have results, that shortcuts have costs, that responsibility and accountability are foundational to achievement.
“Best” reflects Capricorn’s drive not just for success but for excellence and mastery—being the best through sustained effort.

Interpretive Summary
Aquarius energy represents innovation, individuality, and collective progress—the breakthrough that revolutionizes, the unique perspective that advances understanding, and the collaboration of individuals toward future possibility. Ruled by Uranus (modern) or Saturn (traditional) and associated with the 11th house, Aquarius is fundamentally about innovation through objective understanding and collective intelligence.
The Air element provides intellectual perspective and objectivity; the Fixed modality provides sustained commitment to innovation and principle. Aquarius doesn’t conform—it revolutionizes through understanding. The themes reflect this: innovation (breakthrough and advancement), technology (applied understanding), community (collective of individuals), science (objective inquiry), and understanding (intellectual grasp of patterns and systems).
“Detachment” reflects Aquarius’ objective perspective—the ability to step back from emotional investment to see clearly and innovate.
“Randomness” reflects Aquarius’ association with unexpected breakthroughs, chaos theory, and the unpredictable nature of revolutionary change.
The tension between “Individual” and “Community” is central to Aquarius—honoring unique individuality while collaborating collectively. Not conformity, but collaborative innovation.

Interpretive Summary
Pisces energy represents dissolution, transcendence, and the mystical—the merging with something greater, the loss of boundaries, and the access to infinite creative and spiritual realms. Ruled by Neptune (modern) or Jupiter (traditional) and associated with the 12th house, Pisces is fundamentally about transcendence beyond ego and form into the universal.
The Water element provides emotional fluidity and empathy; the Mutable modality provides adaptability and formlessness. Pisces doesn’t define—it dissolves and transcends boundaries. The themes reflect this: dissolution (loss of form), spirituality (connection to divine/universal), imagination (access to infinite creative potential), illusion (what’s not “real” but felt/experienced), and loss (letting go of ego/form).
“Unknown” as the main keyword reflects Pisces’ association with what cannot be known rationally—the mystical, the unconscious, the divine, the imaginal.
“Music & Media” reflects Pisces’ connection to non-verbal, emotional, imaginal communication—art forms that transcend rational language to communicate feeling and spirit.
“Escapism” appears as both gift and shadow—the ability to transcend painful reality, but also the potential to avoid necessary groundedness.

3. Synthesis:
 “This individual presents as bold and action-oriented (Aries Rising), with core identity centered on creative self-expression and leadership (Sun in Leo). However, emotional security comes through disciplined achievement and structure (Moon in Capricorn). The identity naturally supports the creative purpose (Aries→Leo: calibrated reception), but there’s productive friction between impulsive self-presentation and the need for structured emotional accomplishment (Aries→Capricorn: friction for growth). Creative vitality extends toward achievement goals but doesn’t fully merge with them (Leo→Capricorn: extends but doesn’t integrate)—suggesting a person who expresses joyfully but finds deeper satisfaction through tangible accomplishments, with ongoing work to integrate playful creativity with serious achievement.”
