### Energy Tracking Adjustment
  Inputs: date: April 25, 2025, time: noon, rising sign: consistent for ease
  Source: para_0002


### Layering in astrology
  Step 1: figure out what this means before you move on
  Inputs: existing astrological placements
  Outputs: understanding of each layer
  WARNING: don't skip a lot of things along the way
  Source: para_0015


### Identifying emotional cycles
  Step 1: Identify emotional cycles
  Step 2: Intellectualize feelings through releasing them
  Step 3: Engage in physical activity for transformation
  Source: para_0024


### birth time rectification
  Step 1: ask a question to whittle down the ascendant point
  Step 2: figure out where the houses are
  Step 3: use definitive points to narrow down the birth time
  Inputs: birth time, chart data
  Outputs: rectified birth time
  WARNING: It can be challenging for someone who hasn't hit a certain point.

## CALCULATION PIPELINE
  Step 1: Identify if a planet's position is within the Fusion Cusp Area.
    Notes: Determine if the planet affects single or multiple energies.
  Step 2: Determine the Orb of Influence for a planet.
    Notes: This involves measuring the degree of the planet relative to house boundaries.


  Additional calculation steps from transcript:
  Step 0: Identifying whether a planet is within the Fusion Cusp Area or the Orb of Influence based on its degree.
    Formula: null
    Teacher voice: "So, um, the concepts are, they seem very similar on the surface until you start actually looking, um, at what we're talking about here."
  Step 0: Identify the fusion cusp area and its impact on the houses.
    Formula: null
    Teacher voice: "you have to imagine that this... gradient effect from the first house seeping into the second house."
  Step 0: consider how Mars' positioning influences Tangible items, value, and money
    Formula: not stated
    Teacher voice: "Mars is now in the second house, your focus and energy towards value, money, self-worth, tangible items"
  Step 0: Assess north node and moon in relation to each other.
    Formula: null
    Teacher voice: "you do have to assess it with the moon in terms of not how it's linked to the moon, but as like, um, a math equation."
  Step 0: considering Chiron's position on the cusp and its relationship with the north node
    Formula: null
    Teacher voice: "you have to now house the north node factor in because there's a conjunction"
  Step 0: whittle down birth time from three hours to between 30 and 60 minutes
    Formula: null
    Teacher voice: "it took me a while to be able to take a three hour birth time rectification and whittle that down to anywhere between 30 and 60 minutes"
  Step 0: Break down complex energies by analyzing planets, signs, and house rulers.
    Formula: null
    Teacher voice: "you have to stop and you have to go back to Planet sign, house ruler."

## CALCULATION PIPELINE
  Step 1: Determine the orb of influence for Chiron and Moon
    Notes: Chiron has a low orb of influence, the moon has three
  Step 2: Evaluate the impact of Chiron's placement in relation to other celestial bodies and houses
    Notes: Consider the degree alignment and aspects formed
  Step 3: Calculate the aspect interaction details
    Notes: Determine the harmonies or disharmonies based on aspect alignments


  Additional calculation steps from transcript:
  Step 0: Determine the orb of influence for Chiron and Moon
    Formula: not applicable
    Teacher voice: "Chiron has a low orb of influence, the moon has three"
  Step 0: Considering the astrological chart and the degrees of Chiron to assess the relationship dynamics with the mother.
    Formula: not applicable
    Teacher voice: "if you're taking Chiron, you're moving it to 18 degrees, then you're no longer at a Virgo degree, then you're at a Libra degree."
  Step 0: Calculating the distance between the Moon and Chiron
    Formula: not stated
    Teacher voice: "one degree would be 25, 42. This is past one degree"

## TEST CASES (10 test cases)


[TC001] Verify Chiron's influence degree with a low orb of influence.
  Input: {"chiron_orb_of_influence": "low"}
  Expected (teacher voice): Because Chiron has such a low orb of influence, it has a degree of influence of 1.
  Rules: R001
  Entities: Chiron

  Input: {"orb_of_influence_aligned": true, "chiron_alignment": "degree to a degree and a half"}
  Expected (teacher voice): First off, you have true aspects, which means the orb of influence is aligned with both and with Chiron.
  Rules: R002
  Entities: Chiron, aspect spectrum


[TC003] Determine if a forced aspect occurs given specific Chiron placement.
  Input: {"chiron_placement": "17 degrees, 45 arc minutes", "alignment": "18 degrees, 50 arc minutes"}
  Expected (teacher voice): Technically, this is a forced aspect, which means this energy rate here is pulling this energy.
  Rules: R003
  Entities: Chiron


[TC004] Assess if the moon is ready to receive a letter through a trine.
  Input: {"moon_receiving_letter": true, "through_trine": true}

  Rules: R004
  Entities: moon


[TC005] Handle the situation where the moon is not aligned to receive a letter.
  Input: {"moon_receiving_letter": true, "through_trine": true, "alignment_issue": true}
  Expected (teacher voice): There is an issue with alignment in receiving the letter through a trine.
  Rules: R004
  Entities: moon
  [EDGE CASE]


[TC006] Test the spectrum of aspects for known aspect types.
  Input: {"aspect_type": "conjunction"}
  Expected (teacher voice): The aspect is part of the established aspect spectrum, including conjunction.
  Entities: aspect spectrum


[TC007] Test the calculation process with missing orb information.
  Input: {"orb_of_influence": null}
  Expected (teacher voice): Information about the orb of influence is missing, unable to determine aspect.
  Rules: R002
  [EDGE CASE]


[TC008] Test for unknown astrological entities.
  Input: {"unknown_entity": "Nebula"}
  Expected (teacher voice): The entity 'Nebula' is not recognized in the provided astrological rules.
  [EDGE CASE]


[TC009] Verify handling when Chiron does not have a stated influence.
  Input: {"chiron_orb_of_influence": null}
  Expected (teacher voice): Without stating Chiron's orb of influence, the degree of influence cannot be determined.
  Rules: R001
  Entities: Chiron
  [EDGE CASE]


[TC010] Assess the moon's delegated role without aspect context.
  Input: {"moon_as_delegation": true}
  Expected (teacher voice): The moon acts as a delegate for an entire house, acknowledging its influence within its role.
