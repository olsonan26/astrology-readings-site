## PROCEDURES (1 procedures)


### Understanding aspects
  Source: para_0030


## CALCULATION PIPELINE
  Step 1: Determine the degree position of celestial bodies
    Notes: Identify degree positions relative to each other on the astrological chart
  Step 2: Calculate aspect type based on degree
    Notes: Use geometric relationships to determine the type of aspect such as conjunction, sextile, square, etc.
  Step 3: Assess influence within orb
    Notes: Determine if celestial bodies are within each other's orb of influence, which affects the strength of the aspect


  Additional calculation steps from transcript:
  Step 0: calculating aspects based on degree relationships
    Formula: not stated
    Teacher voice: "everything comes down to the math, the trigonometry, the geometry."
  Step 0: Determining the separation degree of planet movements relative to their leadership during conjunctions.
    Formula: null
    Teacher voice: "it could be a couple arc, minutes could be a couple degrees."
  Step 0: Identifying the angle of a square relationship in astrology.
    Formula: not stated
    Teacher voice: "we're talking about a square and there are three versions when we're applying towards 90 degrees. So 88 degrees, 89 degrees, 89 degrees, 30 arc minutes."
  Step 0: Identifying the point of exactitude where both planets are equally supported.
    Formula: not stated
    Teacher voice: "the point of exactitude means 10 degrees, 10 degrees we're right there."
  Step 0: Assessing degrees before full moon
    Formula: not stated
    Teacher voice: "let's say 10 degrees, seven degrees, this is right before the full moon"
  Step 0: Determine the positions of Planet A and Planet B in relation to the 180° mark.
    Formula: null
    Teacher voice: "Pick either planet and see if it’s on the 'before 180°' or 'after 180°' side of the circle compared to the other planet"

## EDGE CASES (7 cases)


- Scenario: Point of exactitude is rare
  Handling: Note that it occurs in certain places such as for an opposition.
- Scenario: if the moon is already crying and depressed
  Handling: then any sort of vital intensity that feeds in will make the moon feel even worse.
- Scenario: Point of exactitude is rare
  Handling: Note that it occurs in certain places such as for an opposition.
- Scenario: if the moon is already crying and depressed
  Handling: then any sort of vital intensity that feeds in will make the moon feel even worse.
- Scenario: planetary position not at exact opposition
  Handling: perception remains similar to opposition despite the distance
- Scenario: When the energies received create distortion and make you feel less than
  Handling: not stated
- Scenario: moon influencing the sun
  Handling: understand that this can feel like a forced integration


## TEST CASES (10 test cases)


[TC001] Test if the system identifies semisextile at degrees 0 and 28
  Input: {"degree1": 0, "degree2": 28}
  Expected (teacher voice): If you have something at zero degrees and something at 28 degrees, it can be semisextile.
  Rules: R001
  Entities: geometrical aspect relationships


[TC002] Test semisextile detection with degrees not 0 and 28
  Input: {"degree1": 5, "degree2": 29}
  Expected (teacher voice): The criteria for semisextile are not met with these degrees.
  Rules: R001
  Entities: geometrical aspect relationships
  [EDGE CASE]


[TC003] Test detection of sextile or conjunct between first and second house
  Input: {"house1": "first", "house2": "second"}
  Expected (teacher voice): If you have something that is in the first house, in the second house, it can be sextile, it could also be conjunct.
  Rules: R002
  Entities: orb of influence


[TC004] Test sextile or conjunct without specific house information
  Input: {"house1": "", "house2": ""}
  Expected (teacher voice): House information is incomplete. Cannot determine if aspect is sextile or conjunct.
  Rules: R002
  Entities: orb of influence
  [EDGE CASE]


[TC005] Test opposition understanding in the chart
  Input: {"aspect": "opposition"}
  Expected (teacher voice): You look at that you say, ah, this opposition is doing this in the chart, and here's how you resolve it.
  Rules: R003


[TC006] Test opposition response with missing opposition data
  Input: {"aspect": ""}
  Expected (teacher voice): Aspect information is missing. Unable to determine chart impact or resolution.
  Rules: R003
  [EDGE CASE]


[TC007] Test geometrical aspect relationships with 0 and 28 degrees
  Input: {"degree1": 0, "degree2": 28}
  Expected (teacher voice): If you have something at zero degrees and something at 28 degrees, it can be semisextile.
  Rules: R001
  Entities: geometrical aspect relationships


[TC008] Test handling an unknown aspect
  Input: {"aspect": "quincunx"}
  Expected (teacher voice): Quincunx is not currently defined in the system. Ensure correct aspect classification.
  [EDGE CASE]


[TC009] Test coverage of a major aspect not typically analyzed, e.g., inconjunct
  Input: {"aspect": "inconjunct"}
  Expected (teacher voice): Inconjunct aspect may not be typically covered, verify if it's significant in your system.
  Entities: major aspects
  [EDGE CASE]


[TC010] Test full cycle of detecting a major aspect from 360-degree division
  Input: {"degrees": [30, 60, 90]}
  Expected (teacher voice): Each 30-degree segment within the 360-degree wheel may represent a major aspect.
  Entities: 30 degree divisions


## UNRESOLVED (2 items)


- not defined specific attributes of full moon
  Needed: attributes regarding the full moon and its influence
- Clarification on the resolution of energies after the 180° switch
  Needed: more specific instructions on how to read natal charts in relation to shifts in the aspect spectrum
