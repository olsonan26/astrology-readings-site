  Formula: 10 + 2 or 10 + 3
  Why: to explain distance in degrees in astrology
  Source: ts_0001, 25:21


 CALCULATION PIPELINE
  Step 1: Determine the distance in degrees between two aspects.
    Notes: When evaluating two points, such as one at 10 degrees and another at 13 degrees, they are three degrees apart.
  Step 2: Calculate the degree difference for boundary cases (e.g., 28 degrees and 2 degrees).
    Notes: Understand boundary conditions where positions might indicate a larger ordistance.


  Additional calculation steps from transcript:
  Step 1: Determine the distance between two degrees in astrology.
    Teacher voice: "when I'm looking here this part of fortunate 10 degrees in this North Node it 13 degrees this right here is you know, three degrees away from each other."
  Step 2: Calculate the difference when the degrees are at 28 and 2.
    Teacher voice: "25 you might have something at 28 degrees something at 2 degrees just understand that's four degrees away."
