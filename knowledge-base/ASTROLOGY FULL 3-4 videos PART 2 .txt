## RULE ENGINE (4 rules)


[R001]
  IF planet aspects are present
  THEN this influences how the Sun plays out in a person's chart
  Teacher voice: "It's not just the Sun and Gemini. It's a sun in Gemini opposite Neptune and Sagittarius..."
  [high] Source: ts_0000, 25:57-5:15


[R002]
  IF planets are in conjunction
  THEN they strengthen and amplify each other.
  Teacher voice: "Planets in conjunction strengthen and amplify."
  [high] Source: ts_0001, 5:15-1:44


[R003]
  IF the Sun and Moon are in conjunction
  THEN this is a new moon.
  Teacher voice: "A new moon is the sun conjunct the Moon."
  [high] Source: ts_0001, 5:15-1:44


[R004]
  IF one planet is involved in an opposition
  THEN there exists a tug of war with another planet.
  Teacher voice: "It's one planet is playing tug of war with another planet."
  [high] Source: ts_0001, 5:15-1:44


## CALCULATION PIPELINE


  Additional calculation steps from transcript:
  Step 0: Look to see if another planet is sharing the same number within one to two degrees
    Formula: not stated
    Teacher voice: "Is there another planet sharing the same number within one to two degrees?"
