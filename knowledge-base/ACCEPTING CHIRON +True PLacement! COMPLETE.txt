  Step 2: Assign the position of zodiac signs based on the earth's rotation and orbital shift.
    Notes: Derived from the earth's rotation's influence on zodiac positions.

    Formula: null
    Teacher voice: "Are they conjunct? Are they in, in, uh, injunction? Are they in a semis, sextile? Because in the same house they could be conjunct, adjunct, uh, semis, sextile or no relation whatsoever."
