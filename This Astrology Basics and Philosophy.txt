This Astrology Basics and Philosophy 
● This Astrology views astrology differently than other systems. 
● Everything in alchemistic astrology is energy. 
● In this system, you do not look at placements (planet in a house or sign) to definitively determine meaning; this is not what you are actually looking at. 
● Instead of reading placements, you read energy: for example, Mars has a certain energy that expresses through a specific area of life and through a specific sign. 
● At the molecular level, everything in existence is energy; it is not definitive. 
● Planets are representations of an energetic field and affect the Earth, which then extends energies that affect you. 
● You are not reading what a placement is, but how it manifests. 
● You should always ask, "How does it manifest?" rather than "What does it mean?" because alchemistically, energy can manifest in a myriad of ways beyond the normal. 
● This Astrology is not fatalistic or deterministic; it focuses on what is likely to happen and gives you the ability to alchemize (shift, harmonize, or redirect energy) to manifest favorable outcomes. 
● Free will is extremely important in alchemistic astrology; you are not a prisoner to your chart. 
● Alchemy is the practice of using energetic awareness to shift, harmonize, or redirect energy within your chart or transit experience. 
● Astrology uses astronomy and is one of the only systems that cares about the actual astronomy. 
● This Astrology is the only system that uses a very specific order for reading energy called PHSR (Planet, House, Sign, Ruler). 
Chart and Interpretation 
● A natal chart is a snapshot of the sky at an exact time and place. 
● The entire 360-degree model of the universe around you is shown with planets, signs, and houses. 
● You are not your Sun sign or any one sign; you are an amalgam of everything in your chart. 
● The order of the planets is important, as it gives context to their energetic frequency through the astronomical doctrine of signatures. 
● Glyphs: Each planet has a symbol, icon, or glyph that you must memorize. ○ The Sun, Moon, and all 10 ruling planets are called "planets" in astrology, even though the Sun is a star and the Moon is a satellite. 
● Planet Groupings: 
○ Ultra-Personal Planets (Sun and Moon): These are the most personal to you and closest to the heart. They are the most important, along with the ascendant, and relate to happiness/purpose and emotional security/needs.
○ Personal Planets (Mercury and Venus): These operate between intrapersonal and interpersonal. They sit between the Earth and the Sun within the ecliptic (the imaginary tether between the Sun and Earth). 
■ The inferior position (between the Earth and Sun) is intrapersonal. For Venus, this is Taurus (self-value); for Mercury, this is Gemini (interior 
mind/mental faculty). 
■ The superior position (Sun is between the planet and Earth) is outward. For Venus, this is Libra (outward value/value in relation to others); for 
Mercury, this is Virgo (outward relation/mental faculty). 
○ Extra-Personal Planet (Mars): This is the only extra-personal planet. It never sits between the Earth and the Sun, making it a connector that connects you (Earth/reality) to the outside world. 
○ Transpersonal Planets (Jupiter and Saturn): These relate to society, the world, and the general public. 
○ Metapersonal Planets (Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto): These set the stage beyond the world (e.g., beyond time, beyond reality). They are not "generational planets". Every planet is personal. 
● Zodiac Signs: The 12 signs are the foundational base of astrology and are 12 ordered energies of grand design based on the 10 planets (with Mercury and Venus ruling two signs each). 
○ The zodiac signs are based on the Earth's axial tilt and the Sun's declination, which creates the seasons (tropical structure), not constellations. 
○ The cardinal signs (Aries, Cancer, Libra, Capricorn) represent the solstices and equinoxes and are pivot points or changes in direction. 
○ The fixed signs (Taurus, Leo, Scorpio, Aquarius) are the sustainers. ○ The mutable signs (Gemini, Virgo, Sagittarius, Pisces) are the adapters, seeking to change and flow. 
● The Natal Wheel (Dual Wheel): 
○ The Inner Wheel (Houses/Fields): Represents the Earth and its spinning (rotation) on its axis, which creates the houses and the ascendant point. Houses (or fields) are the core of your energies and are arguably more important than the zodiac signs initially. 
■ Natural rulership replaces house numbers (1=Aries, 2=Taurus, etc.) to give you your true placements. For example, a planet in the eighth house (naturally ruled by Scorpio) is a Scorpio planet. 
○ The Outer Wheel (Zodiac/Tone): Represents the universe outside and acts as a "stained glass window" or "membrane" that dictates planetary rulership and the tone of the energy. 
○ The Center (Earth): The center circle with an 'X' is the Earth; the entire chart is an extension of the Earth. 
● Transits: These are the universe's synastry with you, represented by the green glyphs on the outside of the natal chart. They permeate the outer wheel (membrane) and push their energies inward.
● PHSR (Planet, House, Sign, Ruler): This is the required reading order for energies. You must consider the focus (Planet), the field (House), the tone (Sign), and the ruler of that sign. 
● Aspects: An aspect is an energy that makes a geometric angle to another, representing how planets interact. 
○ This Astrology recognizes seven major aspects, unlike most systems which use five. This is because every 30-degree relationship must be a major aspect since there are 12 houses in a 360-degree wheel. 
○ The Conjunction means "together"; planets are conjunct when they are within each other's orb of influence of 0 degrees. You must know each planet's specific orb of influence (e.g., Moon is 3 degrees, Sun is 10 degrees) because the lines shown in astrology software based on a 10-degree orb can be inaccurate. 
The required order for reading energy in alchemistic astrology is PHSR. This stands for:1 Planet first 
House second 
Sign third 
Ruler 4th.. 
** VERY IMPORTANT: you must read in this order. The letters are used to describe the focus (Planet), the field (House), the tone (Sign), and what it is all wrapped up in (Ruler). When you expand upon PHSR, you insert deckans, degrees, and aspects 
Angles Locator (ASC, DSC, MC, IC) 
what to show at the top of the card 
● ascendant (ASC): always in the 1st house 
astrology second lesson logan 
● descendant (DSC): always in the 7th house, exact opposite of ASC 
astrology second lesson logan 
● midheaven (MC): can float (not locked to the 10th house), it moves depending on latitude and house system 
astrology second lesson logan 
● IC: exact opposite of MC, and in many tools it’s the unlabeled blue axis line astrology second lesson logan 
beginner hint (important for astro.com style charts)
● he says some software only labels ASC and MC, while DSC and IC are not shown with text and only appear as thin blue lines 
astrology second lesson logan 
● he says the easiest way is to think in axes: ASC–DSC axis and MC–IC axis astrology second lesson logan 
step-by-step locator (UI copy) 
step 1, find ASC 
● look for the ascendant label and degree. 
● rule: ASC can only be in the 1st house 
astrology second lesson logan 
● whole signs note: he says the ascendant point can float anywhere within the 1st house astrology second lesson logan 
● placidus note: he says in Placidus, the ascendant ends up being the 1st house cusp astrology second lesson logan 
● also he points out: when switching to Placidus, the ascendant degree stays the same and “nothing actually changes except the houses” 
astrology second lesson logan 
step 2, compute DSC 
● take the exact ASC degree and go 180° across the wheel. 
● he says: whatever degree the ascendant is sitting at, the descendant is sitting at that exact place because it’s 180 degrees away, and the descendant is always in the 7th house 
astrology second lesson logan 
● UI hint when it’s unlabeled: find the little blue dash on the opposite side, he calls that the descendant 
astrology second lesson logan 
step 3, find MC and compute IC 
● MC is usually labeled (astro.com shows it). 
astrology second lesson logan 
● he says MC can float, and if MC is at 3°, IC is at 3° on the opposite side astrology second lesson logan 
● UI hint when IC is unlabeled: he points to the blue axis line with nothing written and says “this is the IC” 
astrology second lesson logan 
why these points get their own “intensity” styling
● he calls the four points “hot wires” and says when planets access them they’re felt much stronger than planets simply sitting in the 1st/4th/7th/10th house
