00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:07.500
Welcome to the core components aspects and transits class


2
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.200
the majority of what we're gonna be talking about today is aspects aspects


3
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.100
are the glue.


4
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.200
to astrology and


5
00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:18.400
Sometimes I feel like they're glossed over. I think everyone knows


6
00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:22.000
that they're very important every astrologer but a


7
00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.300
lot of websites they seem to gloss over and they gloss over


8
00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.800
some of the what I feel or the more important Transit. So


9
00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.100
just like the other classes. I'm teaching you


10
00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:33.400
my system. I'm teaching you. What I feel is important versus what


11
00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:33.900
I think


12
00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.200
you know systematically something should or shouldn't be


13
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:43.000
so when we're talking about aspects transits


14
00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:45.600
will be at the end. The difference is that aspects are


15
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.100
the relationships between planets. So


16
00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:51.700
if we take a look at my chart


17
00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:52.600
just for example here.


18
00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:56.200
And we look here now. I don't tend to look too much at


19
00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:59.800
these lines because they start becoming this ball of yarn and it


20
00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.700
just becomes too much for me. I'll double


21
00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.200
check everything here and I personally pay attention


22
00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.400
to the numbers here. And this is where the degrees when we


23
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.400
talked in previous classes. Why do degrees matter


24
00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.300
so much and it's not degree Theory. It's the orbs of


25
00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:18.900
influence. We talked in the previous class with transits. I'm


26
00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.100
sorry with aspects and then


27
00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.500
transits will will take on some of this as well. So when


28
00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.100
you're talking aspects for instance,


29
00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.200
Well this one since I'm looking at it in my 12th house


30
00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.300
is my North Node and in North Node we're going to do in another class. But the


31
00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:37.700
North Node has to do with your Soul's journey in the in the leaving


32
00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.900
your comfort zone and balancing yourself


33
00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.900
out to bring in energies that


34
00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.200
you were not familiar with. So we call


35
00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.200
it a sole purpose and it has to do with your moon and I'm gonna do this


36
00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.400
all in a moon class, but


37
00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.400
North no for me is in cancer in the Pluto deck


38
00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.900
in the 12th house in in cancer.


39
00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:59.400
So that is at 13 degrees and


40
00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:03.300
28 minutes. So when you look at the degrees here first two


41
00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:07.000
numbers or one number if it's a single digit are


42
00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:09.600
the degrees and then the other ones are the minutes and


43
00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.400
just like time it goes to 59 minutes


44
00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:13.700
and then resets to zero.


45
00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.400
When you look at my ascendant, it is also at 13 minutes and


46
00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.800
six, I'm sorry 13 degrees and six minutes. This is


47
00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.100
creating a 30 degree angle and it's very


48
00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:27.100
easy to tell because 13 and 13. They're the same


49
00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:30.800
number, you know that there's some sort of aspect being made because they're


50
00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:33.500
the same number and not every aspect is this way


51
00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.400
but a lot of the the major ones that


52
00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.400
you use are going to be the same number the ones


53
00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.100
that are like 45 degrees 135


54
00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:46.300
degrees. Those would be a little bit different but a


55
00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:48.200
lot of them. This one is a 30 degree angle.


56
00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.600
It's one house away and each house consists of


57
00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:55.100
30 degrees each deck in was 10 degrees. So this


58
00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:57.300
is 30 degrees. This is another 30 degrees. So


59
00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:00.300
if they're sitting at the same number, that means they're exactly 30


60
00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:03.400
degrees apart meaning and I'm going to ignore the minutes


61
00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.400
just for this example. That means that


62
00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.200
these are exactly aspected.


63
00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.700
So when you hear somebody say something is exact on an


64
00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:16.900
aspect. It means that they are basically the


65
00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:20.000
same number 13 13. All


66
00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:22.600
right, they're creating that 30 degree angle if


67
00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:25.300
it was 13 and 15. It wouldn't apply because


68
00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:28.400
it's the North Node and the ascendant which are two points.


69
00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:33.200
Mathematical points do not have an orb of influence but let's say they


70
00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:36.300
were planets and let's say they each had two degree


71
00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:39.300
orb of influence. Then the ascendant at


72
00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:41.400
15 degrees would have a 30 degree.


73
00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:44.700
aspect


74
00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:48.100
to this and I'm going to tell you what 30 degrees means. I'm just


75
00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:51.500
showing you example of what this is. Does this


76
00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:54.500
only work one house over. No. This is a specific aspect. You'll


77
00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:59.000
know by the end of this class what I'm talking about. It's anyone.


78
00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:01.300
So any other 13 that I would have in


79
00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:03.300
my chart. I have a 14 up here.


80
00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:07.100
So you see my ascendant is at


81
00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:10.100
13 degrees. My Venus is at


82
00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:13.500
14. It's at 1306 and 1447. This means


83
00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:16.200
there is an aspect created between these two


84
00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:19.500
because they're very close within one degree or technically a


85
00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:22.200
little more than a degree and a half when you do the math in


86
00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:25.200
your head, so I know that my Venus and


87
00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:28.200
my ascendant have some sort of relationship to each other


88
00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:29.500
whereas.


89
00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:33.800
If I look at the Sun.


90
00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:37.300
I had to double check because sometimes math is slow


91
00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:40.200
in it today. It's been a little slow. The sun is


92
00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:43.100
at 21 degrees in this chart. The ascendant is at


93
00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:46.800
13 degrees. These are too far apart to have


94
00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:49.100
any sort of aspect together when you're talking about


95
00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:52.200
full orbs of influence. That's only with conjunctions when you're


96
00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:55.200
talking about which is something I forgot to mention in the previous class. So


97
00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:56.200
it's a good thing you're taking both.


98
00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:01.200
When you're talking about the orbs of influence on oppositions


99
00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:03.600
and squares it Narrows down


100
00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:06.400
a little bit and when you get to 30 degree and 60 degree


101
00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:09.600
angles, then it becomes even narrower to


102
00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:11.100
you know, two to three degrees sometimes.


103
00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:14.200
But 21 degrees 13 degrees means there


104
00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:16.200
is no connection between these two.


105
00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:22.500
So those planets are independent of each other meaning they


106
00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:25.300
are not forming any aspects to each other which means that


107
00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:28.200
they don't impact each other. So when I read the


108
00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:32.200
sun, I don't have to take into account the ascendant other


109
00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:33.600
than separately in the reading.


110
00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:37.800
Is it 13 degrees in every house that influences now?


111
00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:40.500
So the ascendant is the ascendance always


112
00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:43.500
in the first house. And in this case the 13 degrees is


113
00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:45.800
the degree of my ascendant.


114
00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:49.800
And therefore it would be 13 degrees


115
00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:51.500
of any planet in any other house.


116
00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:54.600
if that's what you were asking, but in terms of


117
00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:58.700
and that's what we'd be looking for.


118
00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:03.000
Another example is my ascendants at 13 degrees. My Saturn


119
00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:05.300
is at 15 degrees. This is a two and


120
00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:09.000
a half degree orb of influence between these two, which means there is


121
00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:11.600
an aspect here. So my Saturn down here


122
00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:14.500
at 15 degrees and my ascending at 13 degrees are also


123
00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:17.100
aspected and again, that's what this class


124
00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:19.500
is about. So we're gonna get into what that actually means.


125
00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:21.200
Okay, cool.


126
00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:23.400
so


127
00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:26.700
an aspect in general


128
00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:32.700
like I said is a relationship between two planets two celestial


129
00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:35.600
bodies mathematical points anything that we're looking in the chart an


130
00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:38.400
aspect is whether it's considered to be to be


131
00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:41.600
looked at with another planet. The reason why aspects are


132
00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:44.600
so freaking important is because if


133
00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:46.500
you're looking at somebody's sun sign,


134
00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:50.500
And you read the definition of the sun sign for me. It's the


135
00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:53.300
sun in Gemini. So I'll just use myself now son. And Gemini has


136
00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:56.100
a bunch of meanings from the previous class. You also know to look


137
00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:59.200
at the deccans to know what flavor of the Sun Gemini for


138
00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:02.100
me. It's at 21 degrees 20 to 30 is the third


139
00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:03.900
deck in and that's ruled by Uranus.


140
00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:07.500
So I know that my son is in the 11th house,


141
00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:10.300
which is naturally ruled by Aquarius that it


142
00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:13.300
it deals with Aquarian themes that it's


143
00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:16.300
in Gemini. So it's a Gemini Sun. So


144
00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:19.600
I would read that definition or know it and then


145
00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:23.000
the third deck in I would add in more Aquarian


146
00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:25.500
themes to it as a


147
00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:28.500
layer on top to kind of Define further. What


148
00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:30.400
what that sun means.


149
00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:32.300
If I were to stop there.


150
00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:37.500
That would be very little information which can


151
00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:40.500
happen if my son is not impacting anything else in


152
00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:43.100
the chart. Then there's nothing else to look at the sun


153
00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:46.300
acts independently. It is not connected to anything else. Now.


154
00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:49.800
It's very rare that you will ever come across any


155
00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:52.300
Celestial body that doesn't have some sort


156
00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:55.300
of aspect to something else in the chart. And the


157
00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:58.800
reason why it's so important is because the sun does not operate by


158
00:07:58.800 --> 00:07:59.100
itself.


159
00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:01.800
in my chart in most charts


160
00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:05.200
if I go back to my own chart, for example, and I


161
00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:08.300
come down here when we're looking at these aspects. That's what


162
00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:11.200
this grid is. So the way that this


163
00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:14.600
one is laid out is that the planets kind


164
00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:17.200
of go diagonally down and this is when you


165
00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:20.800
look at the boxes anywhere, there is a glyph in


166
00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:23.200
here and we're using astro.com to pull this up


167
00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:26.500
anytime. You see a glyph here now, it's really hard to see because


168
00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:31.400
If you don't I mean this is actually a really good monitor So It's just


169
00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:34.300
tough to see even when I zoom in but there are other ways to see this as


170
00:08:34.300 --> 00:08:37.400
well. But anytime you see a glyph here that means there is a relationship or


171
00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:40.300
an aspect to the other planet my son


172
00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:43.800
and my moon have a relationship and


173
00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:46.400
the other information here talks about


174
00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:49.200
applying versus separating and I will touch


175
00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:52.300
on that later, but when I go deeper into the


176
00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:55.900
next classes, I will I will go into that even further but


177
00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:58.900
it tells you up here negative five and then separating


178
00:08:58.900 --> 00:09:02.300
So the faster planet is


179
00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:04.500
leaving is already past the


180
00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:07.400
slower planet in this case. The Moon is the faster


181
00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:10.500
Planet. The sun is the slower Planet. So therefore


182
00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:13.500
it separating me in the moon has already passed the Sun.


183
00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:18.300
In terms of the actual direct the


184
00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:20.400
exact or direct aspect. That's the


185
00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:23.400
other word. They use and is is already on its way


186
00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:26.800
leaving and if you look up at the degrees the sun


187
00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:29.800
is at 21 degrees and for


188
00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:32.400
it to be exact. The moon would have to be at 21 degrees,


189
00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:35.200
but it's not it's over here 25:57 almost


190
00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:38.900
26 degrees, which means it has already passed the 21 degree


191
00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:39.900
Mark and it's moving forward.


192
00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:44.200
We'll come back to that. I want to get into all the


193
00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:47.600
aspects so that you understand that better first. So.


194
00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:51.600
So here we go.


195
00:09:52.900 --> 00:09:56.100
Core components aspects will get the translator transits


196
00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:57.800
by the way do make aspects with each other.


197
00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:01.300
And then with your chart which is why you need to know those


198
00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:04.200
as well, but aspects are a relationship the Sun by itself.


199
00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:08.400
If I had a 21 degree son and in


200
00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:11.000
Gemini and someone else had a 21 degree sun in Gemini.


201
00:10:11.900 --> 00:10:14.600
By definition and by most websites, we


202
00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:17.900
would be the same person in terms of our personality our


203
00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:20.600
creative expression and how we view


204
00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:22.600
children how they manifest in our life.


205
00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:28.900
But my son is aspecting all


206
00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:31.300
kinds of other planets. The other person's son


207
00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:34.300
would be aspecting different planets and you have to fuse that


208
00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:37.300
energy in within the relationship to see how does your


209
00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:40.500
son truly play out. It's not just the Sun and


210
00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:43.200
Gemini. It's a sun in for me. It's a sun in Gemini


211
00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:46.300
opposite Neptune and Sagittarius a sun in Gemini trying


212
00:10:46.300 --> 00:10:49.900
the moon in Aquarius the sun in Gemini trying Pluto


213
00:10:49.900 --> 00:10:53.400
a son in Gemini, and then


214
00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:56.100
there's a bunch of others. So it goes deeper and you have to


215
00:10:56.100 --> 00:10:57.300
factor it all into figure that out.


216
00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:02.800
So moving straight into it. What is an aspect their mathematical


217
00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:04.100
relationships between


218
00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:08.200
planets and why did that not flip over?


219
00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:18.800
Oh, it's been fun. It's been a fun Tech.


220
00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:20.200
thing


221
00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:25.400
one second. I will clear this on up.


222
00:11:33.700 --> 00:11:34.200
Yay.


223
00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:36.500
click click cool


224
00:11:37.700 --> 00:11:40.800
technology today and my moon is for the


225
00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:43.700
record just so you guys understand why


226
00:11:43.700 --> 00:11:46.400
this is happening why aspects and transits are


227
00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:49.200
so freaking important to understand because once you understand,


228
00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:53.600
Can it be several planets? Yes, and it


229
00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:56.100
usually is it's multiple things. You have to take them all into


230
00:11:56.100 --> 00:11:56.800
consideration.


231
00:11:57.700 --> 00:12:00.500
Understanding transits for instance. That's not


232
00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:00.800
right now.


233
00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:05.100
Let's see. Today's 12 boom.


234
00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:12.300
It's still not right now. I know that the Moon is and we can do it this way.


235
00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:17.300
Current planets and the reason why it's not exact on


236
00:12:17.300 --> 00:12:20.200
Aster all the time. And sometimes I use


237
00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:23.700
one Astro Dash charts Comm. Sometimes


238
00:12:23.700 --> 00:12:26.300
I'll use that because on the


239
00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:29.100
wheel I can see it exactly for the moment and the time it is and I


240
00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:32.200
can fast forward and move an hour when I create my software. I'm gonna have that


241
00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:35.100
feature in there. But this is the current plan so you can see when I


242
00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:38.300
try to pull up the chart. It looks like the moons that like


243
00:12:38.300 --> 00:12:40.200
three or four to three three degrees.


244
00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:44.500
To 259 or something like that, but the current planets when


245
00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:46.200
I pull it up the moon's actually at 16 degrees.


246
00:12:47.300 --> 00:12:50.300
In my chart Saturn is at 15 degrees.


247
00:12:50.300 --> 00:12:53.900
Meaning there's a third there's a an angle Happening


248
00:12:53.900 --> 00:12:57.800
Here in Saturn is also semi-square my


249
00:12:57.800 --> 00:13:00.100
Uranus. So the whole Tech issue thing that's been


250
00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:01.900
going on has to do with all of this.


251
00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:03.100
anyway


252
00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:06.600
That us go back. We don't need that anymore. I'll keep


253
00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:10.500
that there and we'll switch back. Okay, so aspects


254
00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:12.900
are mathematical relationships between planets.


255
00:13:12.900 --> 00:13:15.200
You have 12 houses to look at so


256
00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:18.600
you're gonna look to see 12 different places. Is there an


257
00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:21.800
aspect is there another planet sharing the same number within


258
00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:25.400
one to two degrees. Usually the difference


259
00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:27.400
is when you get to conjunctions because


260
00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:30.600
the planets are approaching each other directly that you


261
00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:33.400
use the entire orb of influence each angle


262
00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:36.400
created reflects a specific flow of


263
00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:37.600
energy, so


264
00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:41.400
And we're going to get into this but 30 degrees has


265
00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:44.500
a different meaning than 60 degrees has a different meaning than 90


266
00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:46.900
degrees or zero degrees, which is a conjunction.


267
00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:51.500
I mentioned this before but aspects are the glue to astrology.


268
00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:54.400
This is what literally makes you different from


269
00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:57.700
the the next person it differentiates the personality the


270
00:13:57.700 --> 00:14:00.200
event or the interaction the aspect is


271
00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:03.300
what changes the information and makes it


272
00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:06.100
not just a dictionary definition. And if you guys


273
00:14:06.100 --> 00:14:10.000
have seen my social media profiles, I always talk about how


274
00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:12.600
things things and


275
00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:16.000
questions cannot be answered that quickly by one


276
00:14:15.500 --> 00:14:18.600
aspect because you're not factoring in enough information


277
00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:21.900
within the chart you have to be able to look at everything which


278
00:14:21.900 --> 00:14:24.100
includes mostly the aspects.


279
00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:30.500
So orbs of influence apply in their full


280
00:14:30.500 --> 00:14:33.400
values for conjunctions, and they apply


281
00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:38.000
less for different aspects.


282
00:14:37.300 --> 00:14:40.600
So for instance a a 30


283
00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:43.500
degree aspect is a one to two degree orb, and


284
00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:46.300
that's something that I'll get into in. A further class is just a


285
00:14:46.300 --> 00:14:50.000
ton of information and I had to pick and choose what to go to


286
00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:52.000
include here. But each orb of


287
00:14:52.300 --> 00:14:55.100
influence is a little bit different it's wider for trying wider for


288
00:14:55.100 --> 00:14:58.700
oppositions wider for squares because those are considered major aspects the


289
00:14:58.700 --> 00:15:01.800
minor aspects which are like the 30 degrees 60


290
00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:04.100
degrees 150 degrees.


291
00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:07.400
They're 1 to 2 degree orb of


292
00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:07.700
influence.


293
00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:11.600
So if you Google at any point major aspects,


294
00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:14.600
you'll see that conjunctions squares trines


295
00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:16.400
and oppositions are your main four?


296
00:15:18.100 --> 00:15:19.400
And we're going to talk about those.


297
00:15:21.100 --> 00:15:25.400
Anything smaller has a 1 to 2. Sometimes Three Degree orb


298
00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:25.800
of influence.


299
00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:31.000
The one thing you don't really have to worry about too much is the


300
00:15:30.300 --> 00:15:34.100
Moon the Moon tends to have a two


301
00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:35.900
to three degree orb of influence always.


302
00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:38.200
But that's because it matches.


303
00:15:39.100 --> 00:15:42.100
Understanding the relationships gives you


304
00:15:42.100 --> 00:15:45.500
Clarity steers your situations in your favor. The whole point of understanding


305
00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:48.700
aspects is because that is what the true energy


306
00:15:48.700 --> 00:15:51.700
is. How one planet is affecting. Another tells you


307
00:15:51.700 --> 00:15:55.700
how it's probably negatively manifesting


308
00:15:54.700 --> 00:15:57.600
and then how to positively turn


309
00:15:57.600 --> 00:16:00.300
that into your into your benefits so


310
00:16:00.300 --> 00:16:02.400
that it doesn't come off. So harshly.


311
00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:06.900
Understanding for instance that I was having Tech issues allowed me


312
00:16:06.900 --> 00:16:09.500
to Not freak out and just focus on


313
00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:12.600
fixing the issues. So who when


314
00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:15.300
Zoom canceled our webinar package or


315
00:16:15.300 --> 00:16:18.100
whatever and it wouldn't connect and I had to redo the entire thing.


316
00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:23.200
I knew that there was a tech issue and I


317
00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:26.200
just sat there and I figured it out and I got everything up and running


318
00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:29.400
in four to five minutes same thing with what just happened freezing on


319
00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:32.400
the screen. I know that we're still within that energy. So when


320
00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:35.400
these things happen, I just have to find a workaround Not freak out


321
00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:38.400
and that's the whole point because when you're dealing with the moon


322
00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:39.000
specifically


323
00:16:40.100 --> 00:16:44.000
The moon brings up emotion, like situations or people's


324
00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:47.700
interactions that will give you emotional responses.


325
00:16:46.700 --> 00:16:49.900
And then it's up to you to identify.


326
00:16:49.900 --> 00:16:52.300
Hey, I'm acting this way. I need to


327
00:16:52.300 --> 00:16:55.400
chill out and see what's actually going on. So the


328
00:16:55.400 --> 00:16:58.300
Moon is the toughest one in my opinion to deal with I think it's


329
00:16:58.300 --> 00:17:00.400
more difficult than Saturn personally.


330
00:17:01.900 --> 00:17:05.200
Mainly because it's it's always


331
00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:05.600
changing.


332
00:17:06.300 --> 00:17:07.500
And it can come out of nowhere.


333
00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:09.300
so


334
00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:14.600
I so I use this terminology of outcomes of


335
00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:17.400
of events by understanding neutral play out.


336
00:17:18.100 --> 00:17:22.200
When I'm reading your charts or any clients charts, I


337
00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:24.300
read neutral energies meaning the


338
00:17:24.300 --> 00:17:27.500
most common way that a planet


339
00:17:27.500 --> 00:17:30.500
it's most natural usually somewhat negative way


340
00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:33.200
a planetary energy can play out


341
00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:36.400
because most people at this point in time do not know


342
00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:39.400
astrology. They don't know the good stuff anyway, and they


343
00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:42.300
don't understand that when certain things happen. It's


344
00:17:42.300 --> 00:17:45.400
because of an energy linkage to other things which


345
00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:48.300
are playing on a certain way and then the Moon is usually involved and


346
00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:51.900
they are reacting the way the Moon is making them


347
00:17:51.900 --> 00:17:54.300
react which is why it's very important to understand


348
00:17:54.300 --> 00:17:57.300
Moon transits so that you don't act out that way


349
00:17:57.300 --> 00:18:00.200
and then you're you're raising your


350
00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:03.200
vibration and your controlling the chaos instead of


351
00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:06.200
it controlling you which is the whole point of why you're doing this.


352
00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:10.500
And when you're determining the true nature of any energy in a


353
00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:13.500
chart or Transit reading we have to evaluate all links, like


354
00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:16.200
I just said links to other planets and angles to reveal.


355
00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:20.100
It's true nature in your chart to understand why your


356
00:18:19.100 --> 00:18:23.100
son in the 11th house are mine plays


357
00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:25.500
out differently than someone else's son in the 11th


358
00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:28.400
house and it's not just the position. It's not just the the degree.


359
00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:31.200
It's not just you know, the sign or whatever


360
00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:34.600
it's because of the aspects. It is has a


361
00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:38.000
relationship with another planet which gives it a new flavor and


362
00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:40.800
I need to know it's that flavor positive negative challenging


363
00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:43.200
easy doesn't make me lazy. Does it


364
00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:46.700
make me energetic am I aggressive and my passive that's


365
00:18:46.700 --> 00:18:49.800
all based on what planets are involved what angles


366
00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:52.300
being created and how many of those are happening?


367
00:18:52.300 --> 00:18:55.200
And in what order? I don't remember if I put


368
00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:57.700
this in later so I'm just gonna say it now the order


369
00:18:58.500 --> 00:18:58.800
of


370
00:19:00.500 --> 00:19:03.800
of these aspects matters it


371
00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:07.700
always goes in the direction of the chronological


372
00:19:06.700 --> 00:19:09.700
succession of the of


373
00:19:09.700 --> 00:19:12.600
the signs meaning if I'm looking at the


374
00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:15.800
Moon and the Sun and these two


375
00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:18.100
are forming a Trine which they are. I don't


376
00:19:18.100 --> 00:19:21.600
look at the sun first and then go over to the Moon. I look


377
00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:24.400
at the Moon first and it informs the Sun.


378
00:19:25.300 --> 00:19:28.100
If it were the other way around and the moon were in my


379
00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:31.100
11th house in the summer in the seventh, it would be the sun informing the moon.


380
00:19:31.100 --> 00:19:34.600
This is another thing that no one talks about. I've literally never


381
00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:38.300
seen anyone talk about it. So you


382
00:19:37.300 --> 00:19:40.700
guys are privy to this information. It's something


383
00:19:40.700 --> 00:19:43.100
that I figured out a while ago and when I


384
00:19:43.100 --> 00:19:45.800
do readings the reason why I can figure it out is


385
00:19:46.700 --> 00:19:49.300
When I'm reading backward, I know that


386
00:19:49.300 --> 00:19:52.300
it's retrospective when I'm reading


387
00:19:52.300 --> 00:19:55.300
forward. I know that it's not an


388
00:19:55.300 --> 00:19:58.500
introspective, but but forward what's the


389
00:19:58.500 --> 00:20:01.100
word that I would want to use forward affecting?


390
00:20:01.900 --> 00:20:05.100
So I know that the sun is being affected


391
00:20:04.100 --> 00:20:07.600
by the moon. I know that the Moon is affecting


392
00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:10.200
the Sun and that's the natural way that you


393
00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:10.800
would read that.


394
00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:13.500
So let me go back.


395
00:20:16.300 --> 00:20:20.100
So right here, this is just a general. I found this you


396
00:20:19.100 --> 00:20:22.100
see I didn't Watermark it because it's not mine. I found


397
00:20:22.100 --> 00:20:25.100
this online. I removed some of the extraneous stuff. I just


398
00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:28.500
thought it was a really good diagram for the basic and


399
00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:32.000
I'm going to be talking about all of these specific aspects and


400
00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:33.600
then I have one more that I talk about.


401
00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:38.400
Actually, two more there's two one here that so it's


402
00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:41.200
all of these plus two and they're repeated on each


403
00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:45.200
side. So it's we're gonna be learning about the conjunction the semi-sexile


404
00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:47.500
the sex tile the square.


405
00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:50.700
We're also going to learn about the semi-square the Trine


406
00:20:50.700 --> 00:20:53.200
the queen conks and the opposition and then


407
00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:57.500
we're also going to learn about quintiles of by quintiles briefly. So


408
00:20:56.500 --> 00:20:59.200
these are the ones that we're going to be learning.


409
00:21:01.300 --> 00:21:04.600
and how they have, you know relationships with each other and how you


410
00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:04.800
would


411
00:21:05.700 --> 00:21:07.100
to read them


412
00:21:07.900 --> 00:21:10.300
pretty simple. I'll probably be


413
00:21:10.300 --> 00:21:12.600
coming back in referencing this every month every once in a while.


414
00:21:13.300 --> 00:21:15.300
So I'm just gonna hop right into it.


415
00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:19.300
The first one is the conjunction. This is the easiest one


416
00:21:19.300 --> 00:21:22.500
when as an astrologer. The first thing I look for all


417
00:21:22.500 --> 00:21:26.200
your conjunctions because I want to know it's just


418
00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:29.900
a starting point understanding how energies work


419
00:21:29.900 --> 00:21:32.300
with each other and understanding there's a fusion between


420
00:21:32.300 --> 00:21:37.100
energies conjunction is full orb of influence. It's


421
00:21:35.100 --> 00:21:38.600
zero degrees apart


422
00:21:38.600 --> 00:21:41.400
is direct so Planet at 14 degrees


423
00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:44.500
another planet at 14 degrees that is a direct conjunction


424
00:21:44.500 --> 00:21:47.300
or an exact conjunction one degree apart


425
00:21:47.300 --> 00:21:50.100
14 and 15 degrees. So to speak would be a one degree.


426
00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:56.000
Either as either applying or separating conjunction


427
00:21:54.700 --> 00:21:57.500
and then it's the


428
00:21:57.500 --> 00:22:00.500
orb of influence of the planets that we talked about in


429
00:22:00.500 --> 00:22:02.100
the previous class that would tell you.


430
00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:06.500
How far out of a reach does this planet


431
00:22:06.500 --> 00:22:09.200
have when we're talking about conjunctions?


432
00:22:10.900 --> 00:22:13.600
The key word for conjunction is


433
00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:16.900
power because you're adding two planets together


434
00:22:16.900 --> 00:22:19.500
at the same space at the same time.


435
00:22:19.500 --> 00:22:22.500
So it's power. It's Focus. It's a


436
00:22:22.500 --> 00:22:24.300
lot of harnessed energy in one point.


437
00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:28.100
The difficulty of it is a mixture. A lot of


438
00:22:28.100 --> 00:22:31.400
people think that conjunctions are easy that they're always positive and that's


439
00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:31.900
not true.


440
00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:35.400
Sometimes you can have a planet and it


441
00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:38.900
will oscillate it'll go back and forth. Sometimes


442
00:22:38.900 --> 00:22:41.900
One Planet will be stronger than the other planet and


443
00:22:41.900 --> 00:22:44.300
try to take over a certain situations. It's really


444
00:22:44.300 --> 00:22:47.600
on you to realize especially if


445
00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:51.200
something is aspecting it a Transit specifically, how


446
00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:53.800
do you use that energy? And


447
00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:56.900
when let's say it's Mars and Neptune


448
00:22:56.900 --> 00:22:59.400
when Mars and Neptune are you doing


449
00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:02.400
things that are illusionary or are


450
00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:05.100
you doing things that are deceptive if you're


451
00:23:05.100 --> 00:23:08.300
doing things that are deceptive, you know that those two energies are


452
00:23:08.300 --> 00:23:11.500
working together and you're being aggressive about the deception.


453
00:23:11.500 --> 00:23:13.700
Well, you could be passionate about music.


454
00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:17.200
That's a completely different play out


455
00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:20.500
of those two exact same energies and then you want to keep it balanced.


456
00:23:20.500 --> 00:23:22.600
So that one is not taking over the other one.


457
00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:26.400
So when we're talking about when we're only talking


458
00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:28.800
about I'm going to go back to my chart again.


459
00:23:30.300 --> 00:23:33.900
When we're only talking about aspects no


460
00:23:33.900 --> 00:23:35.700
transits right now just aspects.


461
00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:40.800
My charts probably not that great of one because I don't have many conjunctions here.


462
00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:43.400
But I have this one. So Vesta is


463
00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:46.600
an asteroid. We'll be doing that again in another class. It's at 23


464
00:23:46.600 --> 00:23:50.100
degrees 50 minutes two degrees away from my moon 2557.


465
00:23:49.100 --> 00:23:52.400
Literally my eternal flame in my


466
00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:55.800
emotions have to go together. I'm very highly sensitive


467
00:23:55.800 --> 00:23:59.700
highly emotional person and I utilize this


468
00:23:58.700 --> 00:24:01.300
energy and this energy when I'm


469
00:24:01.300 --> 00:24:05.100
good. It lights up I light up when I'm


470
00:24:04.100 --> 00:24:08.300
not in a good place it I


471
00:24:07.300 --> 00:24:10.200
can kick myself back into it. If I


472
00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:13.200
remember my passions my drive the things that


473
00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:16.200
are that are good for me, especially when


474
00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:17.700
it comes to dealing with other people.


475
00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:21.900
Here because it's in my seventh house.


476
00:24:22.500 --> 00:24:23.700
So that's a conjunction there.


477
00:24:25.300 --> 00:24:28.200
It's one of the easiest and obvious aspects to work with it's the


478
00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:32.600
easiest one to find you see them all the time when people talk about stelliums. That's


479
00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:35.100
a cluster of conjunctions. Basically,


480
00:24:34.100 --> 00:24:37.800
it's three or more planets in the same sign within the


481
00:24:37.800 --> 00:24:40.400
orb of influence of each other. That's a


482
00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:44.600
stellium and that is conjunctions a satellitium


483
00:24:43.600 --> 00:24:46.100
for the record is


484
00:24:46.900 --> 00:24:47.800
I'll show you in mine.


485
00:24:48.900 --> 00:24:50.200
This is a satellitium.


486
00:24:50.800 --> 00:24:53.100
These planets not policed but


487
00:24:53.100 --> 00:24:56.200
Mars Saturn and Pluto are not with


488
00:24:56.200 --> 00:25:00.000
any others orb of influence at 5:15 and 24 these planets


489
00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:02.300
do not reach and touch each other. They act


490
00:25:02.300 --> 00:25:05.700
independent independently and in succession in


491
00:25:05.700 --> 00:25:09.000
my chart. So this is called a satellitium these


492
00:25:08.500 --> 00:25:11.600
planets do not affect each other, but they do operate


493
00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:14.200
within the same house slash area of life.


494
00:25:17.700 --> 00:25:20.900
Planets in conjunction strengthen and


495
00:25:20.900 --> 00:25:23.500
amplify we went over that the merging of


496
00:25:23.500 --> 00:25:26.300
the Energies new blend orb of influence determines which


497
00:25:26.300 --> 00:25:30.100
planets are truly involved which is what I was just saying also realize


498
00:25:29.100 --> 00:25:32.400
that Saturn's orb of influence of seven to


499
00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:36.600
eight degrees versus the moons influence of two


500
00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:38.200
to three degrees. Let's just


501
00:25:38.200 --> 00:25:41.500
use the higher-end eight to three that means Saturn could


502
00:25:41.500 --> 00:25:44.500
technically be reaching in and affecting your moon


503
00:25:44.500 --> 00:25:46.900
and your moon might not be affecting Saturn.


504
00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:50.100
they do work together, but there will be a


505
00:25:51.100 --> 00:25:54.400
a pull of one energy over the other because of the orb of


506
00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:54.800
influence.


507
00:25:57.600 --> 00:26:00.800
So that was this that's a conjunction here. And that


508
00:26:00.800 --> 00:26:03.600
is when the two planets are together. Sometimes three


509
00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:06.400
sometimes four it all depends


510
00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:07.900
for the record.


511
00:26:08.700 --> 00:26:11.800
A new moon is a conjunction.


512
00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:15.200
So when people ask me about about the


513
00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:18.100
new moon and New Moon energies, I always go back


514
00:26:18.100 --> 00:26:21.400
to the astrological definition of what a new moon is not the spiritual


515
00:26:21.400 --> 00:26:24.700
references. But a new moon is the sun


516
00:26:24.700 --> 00:26:27.900
conjunct the Moon the Moon


517
00:26:27.900 --> 00:26:30.400
and the Sun are working together. This is why there's


518
00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:32.500
manifestation because your emotions


519
00:26:33.500 --> 00:26:37.000
and the phase of the moon specifically and the


520
00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:41.400
and the sun are working together. The the sun is


521
00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:44.200
not reflecting off of the moon at that point. We're


522
00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:46.400
going to talk about this in our luminaries and lunar class.


523
00:26:47.300 --> 00:26:50.200
But the sun is not reflecting off of the Moon meaning. The Moon is not


524
00:26:50.200 --> 00:26:52.100
as powerful as it is in a full moon.


525
00:26:52.900 --> 00:26:55.700
So this is why you can manifest because your emotionally clear


526
00:26:55.700 --> 00:26:58.600
at that point and you're aligning your emotions with


527
00:26:58.600 --> 00:27:00.700
your personality your drive the things that you want.


528
00:27:01.700 --> 00:27:05.500
for the future and sparking


529
00:27:04.500 --> 00:27:06.900
that that interest


530
00:27:07.900 --> 00:27:10.000
so that's for a new moon. That's a conjunction.


531
00:27:12.300 --> 00:27:15.700
The next one that I want to talk about and I talk about these the order


532
00:27:15.700 --> 00:27:18.600
that I did these is not in order of like first second


533
00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:21.800
third for some people maybe that would have been easier. I actually put


534
00:27:21.800 --> 00:27:23.900
these in order by what I look at first.


535
00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:27.400
Because I make things or I


536
00:27:27.400 --> 00:27:31.100
try to I try to make things easier for myself. So


537
00:27:30.100 --> 00:27:33.100
for me when I'm reading a chart a


538
00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:38.000
a conjunction is the easiest thing to see I get to see


539
00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:41.200
the cluster of planets and how they work together. And then I have a starting point


540
00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:42.400
for when I'm reading a chart.


541
00:27:43.100 --> 00:27:46.300
The next one is an opposition. I always look to


542
00:27:46.300 --> 00:27:49.200
see what's opposing. The other one. Why do I


543
00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:52.900
do that? Because oppositions have to do with awareness they


544
00:27:52.900 --> 00:27:55.000
have to do with when one is and by the


545
00:27:55.300 --> 00:27:56.900
way this these are the glyphs that you'll see.


546
00:27:58.700 --> 00:28:01.700
For each aspect here. So this is when opposition


547
00:28:01.700 --> 00:28:04.100
looks like this was a conjunction so when you're


548
00:28:04.100 --> 00:28:04.700
looking at


549
00:28:07.500 --> 00:28:08.500
this


550
00:28:10.700 --> 00:28:13.500
The moon and investor, this


551
00:28:13.500 --> 00:28:18.000
is the glyph for Moon investor. So this is the conjunction glyph


552
00:28:16.100 --> 00:28:19.500
for that opposition will


553
00:28:19.500 --> 00:28:20.500
look like this one here.


554
00:28:22.500 --> 00:28:26.200
And then opposition here. It's awareness.


555
00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:28.400
It's one planet is playing tug of


556
00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:31.600
war with another planet. And if you go too far


557
00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:34.900
one way, the other planet feels left out which I which


558
00:28:34.900 --> 00:28:35.400
I have here.


559
00:28:36.600 --> 00:28:39.200
And and obviously if you go the other way, it's like


560
00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:42.200
the pendulum swinging you become too involved


561
00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:45.600
in extremes. And sometimes you can even try really hard


562
00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:48.200
to justify or work with


563
00:28:48.200 --> 00:28:49.700
one planet and


564
00:28:51.900 --> 00:28:55.100
If you use a positively you can pull energy from


565
00:28:54.100 --> 00:28:57.800
the other planet fairly easily by


566
00:28:57.800 --> 00:29:00.800
creating a compromise. So it


567
00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:03.500
creates simultaneously a blend and


568
00:29:03.500 --> 00:29:06.900
a tug of war of energy because the opposition is telling


569
00:29:06.900 --> 00:29:09.200
you that in order for that planet to play out.


570
00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:12.300
It is going to be pulled constantly from


571
00:29:12.300 --> 00:29:15.300
the other side. Now a real-world example is again in


572
00:29:15.300 --> 00:29:15.900
my chart.


573
00:29:17.400 --> 00:29:20.300
Every almost everybody has oppositions not everyone but


574
00:29:20.300 --> 00:29:23.300
almost so for me, it's the Sun at 21 degrees


575
00:29:23.300 --> 00:29:25.400
and Neptune at 25 degrees.


576
00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:29.400
These two are in opposition with


577
00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:32.500
each other. This is what makes me a compassionate person


578
00:29:32.500 --> 00:29:35.300
it is what makes me a kind person. It's what


579
00:29:35.300 --> 00:29:39.900
makes me a spiritual person and very intuitive but


580
00:29:39.900 --> 00:29:42.600
it also can work in the negative ways.


581
00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:45.200
And this is when you start really analyzing the


582
00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:48.100
aspects. Remember we were talking about the sun while the Sun


583
00:29:48.100 --> 00:29:51.500
and Gemini is all about, you know, creative expression through writing


584
00:29:51.500 --> 00:29:54.300
create expression through communication being social being


585
00:29:54.300 --> 00:29:57.200
out in public technology things like that


586
00:29:57.200 --> 00:30:01.500
because in the 11th house, but then you have to bring in Neptune.


587
00:30:02.500 --> 00:30:06.000
And Neptune will always be a part of this. So


588
00:30:05.400 --> 00:30:08.500
no matter what this person me will


589
00:30:08.500 --> 00:30:11.200
always be sensitive. This person will


590
00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:15.600
always be there will be an opposition between music listening


591
00:30:14.600 --> 00:30:17.100
to music performing music.


592
00:30:18.600 --> 00:30:21.500
This will always you always have to factor it


593
00:30:21.500 --> 00:30:24.500
in. Sometimes this becomes massive depression


594
00:30:24.500 --> 00:30:27.000
and that has played out in my life quite a bit


595
00:30:27.800 --> 00:30:30.700
because what ends up happening is when the my fire my


596
00:30:30.700 --> 00:30:32.800
son, my light is


597
00:30:33.900 --> 00:30:36.600
Dim, let's say in the last couple


598
00:30:36.600 --> 00:30:38.300
of years when everything was closed down.


599
00:30:39.100 --> 00:30:42.200
And for me, it's the 11th House of society and then


600
00:30:42.200 --> 00:30:45.500
online and Communications online and everybody was saying really hateful


601
00:30:45.500 --> 00:30:48.000
things online. It ends up dimming this


602
00:30:48.300 --> 00:30:52.300
down and then I revert over to here which is illusion loss


603
00:30:51.300 --> 00:30:55.000
feeling like everything's gone disappeared and


604
00:30:54.300 --> 00:30:57.300
not had and then Sagittarius has to do with your place


605
00:30:57.300 --> 00:31:00.300
in the world. I start losing purpose which is


606
00:31:00.300 --> 00:31:02.500
what happened to me and it sucked it was awful.


607
00:31:04.800 --> 00:31:07.500
I had to find a way to connect with


608
00:31:07.500 --> 00:31:10.200
11th house friends and communicate with


609
00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:14.500
friends, especially with Mercury also in there and focus


610
00:31:13.500 --> 00:31:16.700
on my hopes and dreams and ignore the


611
00:31:16.700 --> 00:31:20.800
rest. I had to physically choose what energies


612
00:31:20.800 --> 00:31:23.400
I wanted to use and in what way which again


613
00:31:23.400 --> 00:31:26.600
is the whole point of this do not allow it's a plague


614
00:31:26.600 --> 00:31:29.100
negative. What are the benefits of


615
00:31:30.100 --> 00:31:34.200
Benefits or the themes of a certain placement of


616
00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:36.300
the House of the sign what can


617
00:31:36.300 --> 00:31:39.600
you use instead? So when we're doing these readings that's


618
00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:44.200
what we're doing and that's for the manifestation class. But


619
00:31:42.200 --> 00:31:45.100
that's what you're going to end up


620
00:31:45.100 --> 00:31:48.700
doing you're gonna end up transmuting energy into what


621
00:31:48.700 --> 00:31:51.400
you want it to be instead of how it naturally plays


622
00:31:51.400 --> 00:31:55.000
out. And again Energy's play out very easily. They


623
00:31:54.500 --> 00:31:57.600
slip into that lower octave that lower vibration.


624
00:31:57.600 --> 00:32:01.200
So it's fairly fairly easy to determine


625
00:32:00.200 --> 00:32:03.100
how something played out for somebody


626
00:32:03.100 --> 00:32:06.500
because you could always kind of gravitate towards the neutral


627
00:32:06.500 --> 00:32:09.000
and lower vibrations and you're usually right


628
00:32:09.900 --> 00:32:12.300
people don't usually know that they can take that energy


629
00:32:12.300 --> 00:32:14.300
and do something very positive with it.


630
00:32:16.100 --> 00:32:17.200
You do get a


631
00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:22.600
the ability for an active equal compromise to


632
00:32:22.600 --> 00:32:25.600
be made with the energies and resolve the difficulty


633
00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:28.900
that tension that goes back and forth compromise. This


634
00:32:28.900 --> 00:32:31.200
is marriage. This is Opposites attract.


635
00:32:31.700 --> 00:32:34.600
When I was talking in the first class about the houses


636
00:32:34.600 --> 00:32:37.600
and how the first house in the seventh house. The


637
00:32:37.600 --> 00:32:40.200
first house is the house of self. The seventh house is


638
00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:43.300
the house of you and others or Partnership if you spend


639
00:32:43.300 --> 00:32:46.400
too much time on you you lose out on Partners if you spend too


640
00:32:46.400 --> 00:32:49.600
much time on Partners you lose out on you compromise is


641
00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:52.700
you being able to be independent within your partnership.


642
00:32:56.300 --> 00:32:59.800
And your neptuneffects your son. So when balancing this


643
00:32:59.800 --> 00:33:02.000
tug of war you assess how Neptune can


644
00:33:02.300 --> 00:33:03.500
influence your son more positively, correct?


645
00:33:04.400 --> 00:33:08.300
What are the positive aspects of Neptune how


646
00:33:07.300 --> 00:33:11.100
can I not feel illusion depression


647
00:33:10.100 --> 00:33:13.200
the the loss of


648
00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:17.800
everything? What are the higher vibrations spirituality and


649
00:33:17.800 --> 00:33:20.300
actually around that time is why I really started diving back


650
00:33:20.300 --> 00:33:23.500
into astrology and going crazy with it and


651
00:33:23.500 --> 00:33:26.300
getting into Taro and learning tarot. That was all because of


652
00:33:26.300 --> 00:33:29.300
that time, but I was going through that that depression and I had


653
00:33:29.300 --> 00:33:29.900
to change it.


654
00:33:30.900 --> 00:33:33.300
And I had to take Neptune and say I


655
00:33:33.300 --> 00:33:35.200
don't want to be like I don't want to feel like this anymore.


656
00:33:36.200 --> 00:33:40.000
And there's more there are more planets aspecting both of


657
00:33:39.100 --> 00:33:42.100
those planets actually, but I had to


658
00:33:42.100 --> 00:33:46.300
figure out how was how was it that I was going to make those


659
00:33:46.300 --> 00:33:49.400
changes and I it wasn't just the Sun that I had the factor in


660
00:33:49.400 --> 00:33:50.600
or Neptune for me.


661
00:33:51.700 --> 00:33:54.500
I had the factor in Pluto the moon


662
00:33:54.500 --> 00:33:57.500
and Chiron because they all make Direct.


663
00:33:59.700 --> 00:34:02.600
aspects to my my Neptune


664
00:34:04.700 --> 00:34:08.600
This is Opposites Attract this I


665
00:34:08.600 --> 00:34:11.100
put this in here mainly because when you do synastry, you'll


666
00:34:11.100 --> 00:34:14.700
see a lot of people who are like someone will have a Mars


667
00:34:14.700 --> 00:34:17.300
in Mars and Taurus


668
00:34:17.300 --> 00:34:21.300
and there'll be attracted to somebody with something either Mars


669
00:34:20.300 --> 00:34:23.200
or a Venus or a Pluto or Jupiter or


670
00:34:23.200 --> 00:34:26.300
something in Scorpio because it's a Opposites Attract game


671
00:34:26.300 --> 00:34:29.600
because it's all about balancing and compromising and we're naturally


672
00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:32.200
attracted to what's on the other side. That's like


673
00:34:32.200 --> 00:34:35.300
a grass is greener type 5, but you can't go live in


674
00:34:35.300 --> 00:34:38.300
the in the neighbor's yard because then you miss your home. So it's


675
00:34:38.300 --> 00:34:41.300
like you have to like go over there spend some time come home.


676
00:34:41.300 --> 00:34:43.100
It's all about compromise here.


677
00:34:44.400 --> 00:34:47.100
So Pluto opposed the sun you would use


678
00:34:47.100 --> 00:34:50.300
rebirth regeneration to enhance the sun. You could


679
00:34:50.300 --> 00:34:53.200
use the occult. Like you could find a career in


680
00:34:53.200 --> 00:34:56.900
the occult. As long as you don't get lost in the occult because they are opposite in


681
00:34:56.900 --> 00:35:00.200
their balanced and that could be your creative expression I


682
00:34:59.200 --> 00:35:02.400
transformation on a positive level would


683
00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:05.800
be really good especially when it comes to your creative talents and


684
00:35:05.800 --> 00:35:09.100
being able to realize that


685
00:35:08.100 --> 00:35:11.100
the things that you've done in the past that you


686
00:35:11.100 --> 00:35:14.600
can level up and you can change those things. You could bring shared


687
00:35:14.600 --> 00:35:17.100
assets depending on what house and sign we're talking about


688
00:35:17.100 --> 00:35:20.300
shared assets can be brought in so you could be


689
00:35:20.300 --> 00:35:23.100
in your creative expression and your personality. You


690
00:35:23.100 --> 00:35:26.500
could be pulling from other people's stuff and blending it


691
00:35:26.500 --> 00:35:29.100
in with your unique Flair and you see that


692
00:35:29.100 --> 00:35:33.500
all the time like just think of Music how many covers are


693
00:35:33.500 --> 00:35:36.200
done, but those I just had a reading with somebody about


694
00:35:36.200 --> 00:35:39.500
this actually how many covers are done but those


695
00:35:39.500 --> 00:35:42.600
covers don't sound exactly like the original they took


696
00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:44.300
that material and they put


697
00:35:44.500 --> 00:35:47.700
Their own positive spin on it and needed their own that's either


698
00:35:47.700 --> 00:35:50.300
Pluto or Pluto and or


699
00:35:50.300 --> 00:35:53.600
Uranus that is aspecting the sun and/or


700
00:35:53.600 --> 00:35:56.000
Pisces in those charts because those are the


701
00:35:56.100 --> 00:35:59.000
ones that have to create expression music and talents and things like that.


702
00:36:00.200 --> 00:36:03.500
So yeah, you would you would take the positives of


703
00:36:03.500 --> 00:36:06.200
Pluto also personal power. This is


704
00:36:06.200 --> 00:36:09.600
where you know personal power for Pluto opposite. The sun is you


705
00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:12.800
you don't want to be super controlling but


706
00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:15.300
you want to realize that you have inner power that you


707
00:36:15.300 --> 00:36:18.200
can do the things you want to do and you can shine and


708
00:36:18.200 --> 00:36:21.300
people are going to be attracted to you if you are well


709
00:36:21.300 --> 00:36:22.200
balanced out.


710
00:36:23.800 --> 00:36:26.200
There'll be attracted to you for the right reasons. If you are


711
00:36:26.200 --> 00:36:30.000
leaning too heavily into your Pluto and you become manipulative controlling or


712
00:36:29.600 --> 00:36:32.500
anything like that. You will still attract


713
00:36:32.500 --> 00:36:35.300
people because Pluto does that but you'll be attracting the wrong people


714
00:36:35.300 --> 00:36:38.400
who will be then attacking your personality. They


715
00:36:38.400 --> 00:36:39.900
will literally be in opposition.


716
00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:42.100
Who you are as a person?


717
00:36:46.300 --> 00:36:49.300
My Pluto in midheaven are


718
00:36:49.300 --> 00:36:52.400
conjunct at the same degree in the 11th house. I am sure you've told


719
00:36:52.400 --> 00:36:55.200
me was a signify for me again. You have


720
00:36:55.200 --> 00:36:58.700
to look at everything but Pluto in the midheaven is potential power.


721
00:36:59.500 --> 00:37:02.300
Within your career and your life purpose


722
00:37:02.300 --> 00:37:06.300
in the 11th house has to do with hope stream's future technology or


723
00:37:05.300 --> 00:37:08.400
groups or community.


724
00:37:09.100 --> 00:37:14.200
So you could be very powerful within the community within


725
00:37:12.200 --> 00:37:15.500
what the career you're


726
00:37:15.500 --> 00:37:18.400
doing. And then you would you would assess the sign and


727
00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:21.400
you would assess everything else but Pluto in the mid Heaven a


728
00:37:21.400 --> 00:37:24.400
lot of famous people actually have that but they've


729
00:37:25.100 --> 00:37:27.900
They fall into how to use it positively.


730
00:37:31.100 --> 00:37:35.300
How are you able to give so many examples of a single aspect I have


731
00:37:34.300 --> 00:37:37.600
to be able to do that good scene. So yeah


732
00:37:37.600 --> 00:37:40.100
after you've done it for a while you'll be able to do the same


733
00:37:40.100 --> 00:37:43.000
thing. It's because I break it down


734
00:37:43.300 --> 00:37:43.500
in my head.


735
00:37:44.300 --> 00:37:47.800
And then I put together a


736
00:37:47.800 --> 00:37:50.300
sentence and then I give you that and then I do it again and


737
00:37:50.300 --> 00:37:53.500
I do it again and that's what you really have to do with astrology as


738
00:37:53.500 --> 00:37:56.400
a whole is it can be extremely overwhelming?


739
00:37:57.300 --> 00:38:00.400
If you just approach someone's chart and you see it like this and you


740
00:38:00.400 --> 00:38:03.200
just try to find something and start talking about it. This is


741
00:38:03.200 --> 00:38:06.200
why I don't like to do like General readings when people


742
00:38:06.200 --> 00:38:09.200
like hey, what do you see in my chart? That stands out and I'm like, you know, I could


743
00:38:09.200 --> 00:38:13.500
look at it in the first thing that pops in my head. I could start talking about that, but


744
00:38:12.500 --> 00:38:14.900
it can be extremely overwhelming.


745
00:38:15.700 --> 00:38:18.100
And even when you know, I've been doing this for as long


746
00:38:18.100 --> 00:38:21.400
as I have and I I know the question and I start honing in


747
00:38:21.400 --> 00:38:24.300
that sometimes I I still get a little overwhelmed because


748
00:38:24.300 --> 00:38:27.400
some people's charts are just more difficult to analyze


749
00:38:27.400 --> 00:38:28.600
because there's more going on.


750
00:38:29.600 --> 00:38:32.500
Especially when it when it comes to harder aspects,


751
00:38:32.500 --> 00:38:33.200
which we'll get into.


752
00:38:35.600 --> 00:38:38.400
Like oppositions to me. They're considered hard


753
00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:42.200
difficult aspects, but to me, they're not that difficult oppositions are


754
00:38:41.200 --> 00:38:44.500
pretty easy to say, you know, it just blend the energies.


755
00:38:45.100 --> 00:38:48.100
Find your compromise and move forward with that


756
00:38:48.100 --> 00:38:51.300
and it to me it gives you like a duality in


757
00:38:51.300 --> 00:38:54.400
an opposition because you can focus on one energy and just


758
00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:57.600
pull some of the energy from the opposition in and


759
00:38:57.600 --> 00:39:00.100
then at other times you can go back to the other energy and pull


760
00:39:00.100 --> 00:39:04.200
the other opposition in so Sun opposite Neptune.


761
00:39:03.200 --> 00:39:06.400
I can you know, focus on


762
00:39:06.400 --> 00:39:09.500
the Neptune stuff and then pull in my ego my


763
00:39:09.500 --> 00:39:12.100
personality and me or I can focus on


764
00:39:12.100 --> 00:39:15.700
my ego and pull in a little bit of spirituality and


765
00:39:15.700 --> 00:39:18.700
it's too completely different things. So I want to focus on spirituality. You


766
00:39:18.700 --> 00:39:21.400
want to focus on me in an opposition. You


767
00:39:21.400 --> 00:39:24.200
actually get the choice and I think that's pretty cool. You don't


768
00:39:24.200 --> 00:39:27.800
get that with like anything else other than kind of a conjunction, but


769
00:39:27.800 --> 00:39:28.300
then you choose


770
00:39:29.300 --> 00:39:33.100
But I know what the sun means so basically when I'm giving examples if


771
00:39:32.100 --> 00:39:36.000
we're talking about sun and Neptune, I just what's one


772
00:39:35.100 --> 00:39:38.500
thing the sun represents creative expression. Cool.


773
00:39:38.500 --> 00:39:42.000
What's one thing that Neptune represents music?


774
00:39:41.900 --> 00:39:44.500
Okay. Well, it's opposites if


775
00:39:44.500 --> 00:39:47.300
I spend too much time on my music no one will


776
00:39:47.300 --> 00:39:50.100
ever see it because I'm not creatively expressing it. I'll actually


777
00:39:50.100 --> 00:39:54.400
pigeonhole myself in and then as I'm saying this example


778
00:39:53.400 --> 00:39:56.300
other like the whole


779
00:39:56.300 --> 00:39:59.100
laundry list of everything that Neptune means like plays out in my


780
00:39:59.100 --> 00:40:03.100
head. The other thing that Neptune means is isolation and seclusion. So


781
00:40:02.100 --> 00:40:05.200
if I and I used to do this I


782
00:40:05.200 --> 00:40:08.400
used to go into my recording studio when I had one when I


783
00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:11.700
was much younger, and I'd stay there for days and


784
00:40:11.700 --> 00:40:13.600
not come out and no one would see me.


785
00:40:14.300 --> 00:40:17.300
And that can happen and I and the thing is for me. It's in


786
00:40:17.300 --> 00:40:20.300
my fifth house. It was like a hobby. It was really fun. I enjoyed doing it


787
00:40:20.300 --> 00:40:20.500
but


788
00:40:21.400 --> 00:40:24.300
in by myself because of Uranus here,


789
00:40:24.300 --> 00:40:27.100
but people didn't see me and no one got


790
00:40:27.100 --> 00:40:30.400
to hear any of my music because I was not sharing it. I had


791
00:40:30.400 --> 00:40:33.100
to like come out of this and come back to here and


792
00:40:33.100 --> 00:40:36.100
then talk to my friends again or go out in society or whatever and then


793
00:40:36.100 --> 00:40:36.900
I can share this.


794
00:40:38.600 --> 00:40:40.100
all these talents


795
00:40:41.800 --> 00:40:44.600
So that's an opposition. Like I said conjunctions oppositions.


796
00:40:44.600 --> 00:40:47.300
I do them in that order because I want to make it easier


797
00:40:47.300 --> 00:40:50.500
for myself when I'm doing readings and it's the easiest thing


798
00:40:50.500 --> 00:40:52.000
to balance out in my opinion.


799
00:40:53.500 --> 00:40:56.300
And you can have a conjunction with an opposition. You


800
00:40:56.300 --> 00:40:59.700
could have the sun in Mercury together opposing Neptune


801
00:40:59.700 --> 00:41:02.700
or whatever planets are involved. And in


802
00:41:02.700 --> 00:41:05.900
that case I would do the conjunction first so


803
00:41:05.900 --> 00:41:07.800
that I understand that blend of energy.


804
00:41:08.900 --> 00:41:11.200
And then bring in the opposition again, I do


805
00:41:11.200 --> 00:41:11.900
it in this order.


806
00:41:12.700 --> 00:41:13.400
intentionally


807
00:41:16.800 --> 00:41:19.700
so a conjunctions within 10 degrees are various a


808
00:41:19.700 --> 00:41:22.900
conjunction is within


809
00:41:22.900 --> 00:41:25.200
the degrees of the orb of influence for the


810
00:41:25.200 --> 00:41:28.100
planet. So in our last class when we talked about orbs of


811
00:41:28.100 --> 00:41:31.400
influence, that number is what you use so if


812
00:41:31.400 --> 00:41:35.000
it's Mars you're talking about four to five degrees if you're


813
00:41:34.100 --> 00:41:37.600
talking about the sun you're talking about seven to eight degrees a lot


814
00:41:37.600 --> 00:41:40.700
of these softwares use 10 degrees. I do


815
00:41:40.700 --> 00:41:43.400
not because 10 degrees even for the sun is


816
00:41:43.400 --> 00:41:47.200
just too far in my opinion every once


817
00:41:46.200 --> 00:41:50.400
in a while for the sun. I'll consider it but for


818
00:41:49.400 --> 00:41:51.100
anything else no,


819
00:41:54.800 --> 00:41:56.300
But that's for conjunctions. Yeah.


820
00:41:59.400 --> 00:41:59.800
cool you


821
00:42:01.400 --> 00:42:05.200
cool oppositions squares


822
00:42:05.800 --> 00:42:08.100
okay, so squares are the ones


823
00:42:08.100 --> 00:42:08.500
that are


824
00:42:09.700 --> 00:42:12.400
we see squares all the time squares have


825
00:42:12.400 --> 00:42:15.200
such a bad rap and I understand why they do if you


826
00:42:15.200 --> 00:42:18.300
don't go deep enough into astrology the first thing you're gonna think when you


827
00:42:18.300 --> 00:42:20.500
read it is, ah, this sucks. There's a square


828
00:42:21.500 --> 00:42:24.100
squares represent conflict


829
00:42:26.300 --> 00:42:29.800
You know the thing about conflict is there's usually resolution or


830
00:42:29.800 --> 00:42:33.100
there can be resolution. And that's the part most


831
00:42:32.100 --> 00:42:35.600
people miss out when they're talking about squares


832
00:42:35.600 --> 00:42:39.400
is that there can be resolution with conflict the difficulty


833
00:42:38.400 --> 00:42:41.500
can be very high because it can be very difficult


834
00:42:41.500 --> 00:42:44.300
to take these two energies and


835
00:42:44.300 --> 00:42:47.500
find a way to fuse them together in a way that both planets are


836
00:42:47.500 --> 00:42:50.200
appeased. And that's the key is that


837
00:42:50.200 --> 00:42:53.500
in a square. You cannot leave one out in an opposition.


838
00:42:53.500 --> 00:42:56.700
You can in a conjunction you sort


839
00:42:56.700 --> 00:42:57.600
of can sort of


840
00:42:58.500 --> 00:43:01.200
In a square, you can't One Planet needs to


841
00:43:01.200 --> 00:43:04.700
be appeased with the other and there's very little compromise


842
00:43:04.700 --> 00:43:05.300
when you do this.


843
00:43:06.400 --> 00:43:10.400
It's in the 90 degree angle to make it direct it


844
00:43:09.400 --> 00:43:12.300
is one of the more difficult ones to deal


845
00:43:12.300 --> 00:43:15.500
with but once you get it, you can become very powerful. It has


846
00:43:15.500 --> 00:43:18.600
friction. It's a very energetic and


847
00:43:20.500 --> 00:43:23.800
you can actually create a lot of progress people who do amazing


848
00:43:23.800 --> 00:43:26.200
things in this world tend to have


849
00:43:26.200 --> 00:43:30.500
a lot of squares in their chart or specifically within powerful


850
00:43:29.500 --> 00:43:31.300
planets.


851
00:43:32.300 --> 00:43:35.200
This is when two planets want to occupy the same space at


852
00:43:35.200 --> 00:43:38.700
the same time creating an energetic disagreement and


853
00:43:38.700 --> 00:43:41.300
stubbornness. Neither energy will budge.


854
00:43:42.300 --> 00:43:45.300
It requires compromise only in the sense of


855
00:43:45.300 --> 00:43:48.300
blending. I'm sorry bending the energy


856
00:43:48.300 --> 00:43:51.800
to create a situation which both energies


857
00:43:51.800 --> 00:43:52.300
are happy.


858
00:43:52.900 --> 00:43:55.900
This is not easy because each energy


859
00:43:55.900 --> 00:43:58.500
is usually and for the


860
00:43:58.500 --> 00:44:01.600
record. Also, I want to mention that I


861
00:44:01.600 --> 00:44:04.200
don't talk about elements or modality at all


862
00:44:04.200 --> 00:44:08.100
in this in this class. So fire earth


863
00:44:07.100 --> 00:44:10.300
water. There's a very important but this class


864
00:44:10.300 --> 00:44:11.700
I'm not going to be talking about that.


865
00:44:12.500 --> 00:44:15.000
For a very specific reason and I


866
00:44:15.200 --> 00:44:19.000
don't talk about the modality Cardinal fixed or


867
00:44:18.800 --> 00:44:21.600
mutable. I don't talk about that either in this


868
00:44:21.600 --> 00:44:22.500
class because


869
00:44:23.800 --> 00:44:26.500
When you read up on aspects, especially like


870
00:44:26.500 --> 00:44:28.400
a square they will tell you that.


871
00:44:30.300 --> 00:44:30.600
that the


872
00:44:32.300 --> 00:44:35.400
let me go back to this that so for instance in my chart the ascendant


873
00:44:35.400 --> 00:44:38.900
and the Venus are squaring each other that the modality


874
00:44:38.900 --> 00:44:41.100
is the same. It's fixed and


875
00:44:41.100 --> 00:44:44.200
fixed or in terms of Gemini and


876
00:44:44.200 --> 00:44:47.700
Pisces. It's mutable mutable same modality.


877
00:44:48.500 --> 00:44:51.700
But different elements and that's the conflict. So


878
00:44:51.700 --> 00:44:54.300
they both share the same type of modality which


879
00:44:54.300 --> 00:44:57.500
makes it difficult. The reason why I'm not talking


880
00:44:57.500 --> 00:45:01.000
about this and not using this in this class is


881
00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:01.400
because


882
00:45:02.800 --> 00:45:05.100
you I don't have one in my chart, but


883
00:45:05.100 --> 00:45:06.800
you can do I in this random chart.


884
00:45:10.100 --> 00:45:13.100
I don't but I'll use this as an example and I'll see one


885
00:45:13.100 --> 00:45:15.300
right off the top but I'll use this as an example.


886
00:45:19.900 --> 00:45:21.000
Actually, I do have one.


887
00:45:23.700 --> 00:45:26.200
But that's obvious. Okay, so I'll use this


888
00:45:26.200 --> 00:45:29.300
as an example. So you see the North Node right here at one


889
00:45:29.300 --> 00:45:33.200
degree and you see the Sun at zero degrees. Well, this


890
00:45:32.200 --> 00:45:35.700
is the same thing. So we have a cardinal sign


891
00:45:35.700 --> 00:45:39.000
water Cardinal sign air and at


892
00:45:38.200 --> 00:45:41.200
one degree and zero degrees. This is a one degree


893
00:45:41.200 --> 00:45:44.300
difference for a square which is


894
00:45:44.300 --> 00:45:46.400
three houses away. Boom. One, two, three.


895
00:45:47.200 --> 00:45:50.300
So this is the 90 degree angle and is creating


896
00:45:50.300 --> 00:45:53.300
now if the sun was over here at let's say


897
00:45:53.300 --> 00:45:56.100
28 degrees then all the sudden we're talking


898
00:45:56.100 --> 00:45:59.200
about what most astrologers would call


899
00:45:59.200 --> 00:46:02.400
a Trine even though the by the


900
00:46:02.400 --> 00:46:07.700
degrees it's not they always say that the same element aspecting


901
00:46:05.700 --> 00:46:08.300
another in the


902
00:46:08.300 --> 00:46:10.900
same element is a Trine, but that's not true.


903
00:46:11.700 --> 00:46:14.200
If the sun were sitting at 28 degrees it is still


904
00:46:14.200 --> 00:46:17.900
a square. This is why the degrees matter the elements


905
00:46:17.900 --> 00:46:20.300
do not when you're when you


906
00:46:20.300 --> 00:46:24.000
factor in and really kind of get into breaking down


907
00:46:24.300 --> 00:46:27.500
the square itself. You will use the modality you will use the


908
00:46:27.500 --> 00:46:30.600
element to describe how to move


909
00:46:30.600 --> 00:46:31.400
forward with something.


910
00:46:32.300 --> 00:46:35.300
But you know telling you that it has


911
00:46:35.300 --> 00:46:39.400
to be like I said the same modality and different element


912
00:46:38.400 --> 00:46:41.300
is just simply not true. And


913
00:46:41.300 --> 00:46:44.600
that's another kind of like social media conspiracy, but not


914
00:46:44.600 --> 00:46:47.300
even just on social media all the textbooks say the


915
00:46:47.300 --> 00:46:50.900
same thing and that's a problem in my eyes because like


916
00:46:50.900 --> 00:46:53.700
I said, you could have a 28 degree Gemini sun


917
00:46:53.700 --> 00:46:56.500
with a one degree Libra North


918
00:46:56.500 --> 00:46:59.200
Node and that is still a square. It's well within the orb of


919
00:46:59.200 --> 00:47:02.700
influence and it is in the same element. So that's the


920
00:47:02.700 --> 00:47:05.200
reason I'm not doing those in this class. So if you read up on


921
00:47:05.200 --> 00:47:08.600
definitions, you'll constantly see that a square is that a


922
00:47:08.600 --> 00:47:11.200
Trine is the same element trying to not


923
00:47:11.200 --> 00:47:14.200
have to be the same element and we'll get into that as well. They could be


924
00:47:14.200 --> 00:47:15.600
too completely different elements.


925
00:47:17.700 --> 00:47:21.000
Where were we compromised bending?


926
00:47:20.300 --> 00:47:24.800
Yeah, so you have to appease both of these energies equally


927
00:47:23.800 --> 00:47:26.200
to make it work, right?


928
00:47:26.200 --> 00:47:29.300
It's always considered negative by almost every


929
00:47:29.300 --> 00:47:32.900
single astrologer and astrology resource yet without squares


930
00:47:32.900 --> 00:47:35.600
progress through action would not exist


931
00:47:35.600 --> 00:47:38.400
Mars as the planet of action is not


932
00:47:38.400 --> 00:47:41.700
suitable enough strong enough to


933
00:47:41.700 --> 00:47:44.100
create progress and action for


934
00:47:44.100 --> 00:47:47.700
everything squares create that friction that


935
00:47:47.700 --> 00:47:50.600
create resolution that create new


936
00:47:50.600 --> 00:47:53.700
opportunities squares can be highly good


937
00:47:53.700 --> 00:47:55.700
things highly positive things.


938
00:47:56.500 --> 00:47:57.900
aspects


939
00:47:59.300 --> 00:48:02.400
you need squares somebody without squares in


940
00:48:02.400 --> 00:48:04.700
their chart may never accomplish anything in their life.


941
00:48:05.500 --> 00:48:06.000
They may


942
00:48:06.900 --> 00:48:09.200
But most likely they won't do as much as they could


943
00:48:09.200 --> 00:48:12.300
because you need that energy. You need that friction. You


944
00:48:12.300 --> 00:48:15.400
need that that disagreement and


945
00:48:15.400 --> 00:48:18.700
that Discord to be able to move forward if we could


946
00:48:18.700 --> 00:48:21.100
you imagine what sports would be without conflict.


947
00:48:22.100 --> 00:48:25.700
Without competition there would be there would be no sport there


948
00:48:25.700 --> 00:48:28.800
would be no winner. There'd be no loser. There'd be no there'd


949
00:48:28.800 --> 00:48:31.100
be nothing they would just be a bunch of people just passing the ball


950
00:48:31.100 --> 00:48:31.800
around that would be practice.


951
00:48:35.200 --> 00:48:38.400
When I say bending the energies I'm talking about finding.


952
00:48:39.300 --> 00:48:40.500
finding the


953
00:48:41.500 --> 00:48:42.300
the way


954
00:48:43.600 --> 00:48:46.500
that an energy can play out by saying


955
00:48:46.500 --> 00:48:49.600
here's it's lower vibration here. It's higher vibration that


956
00:48:49.600 --> 00:48:53.200
will make a situation work and


957
00:48:52.200 --> 00:48:55.500
that's that's not something I can really blanket


958
00:48:55.500 --> 00:48:57.400
statement any more detailed.


959
00:48:58.200 --> 00:49:01.200
More specific about because it depends on the situation we're talking


960
00:49:01.200 --> 00:49:01.500
about.


961
00:49:02.400 --> 00:49:05.400
Sometimes you have to use the lower vibration of a planet. Sometimes


962
00:49:05.400 --> 00:49:09.600
you need to bring in the aggression from Mars


963
00:49:08.600 --> 00:49:12.200
to get something done other


964
00:49:11.200 --> 00:49:14.300
times you want to use passion other times.


965
00:49:14.300 --> 00:49:15.600
You just want to use competition.


966
00:49:16.400 --> 00:49:19.600
It depends on what we're talking about, but you


967
00:49:19.600 --> 00:49:22.300
want to bend it so that it is happy and it's


968
00:49:22.300 --> 00:49:25.200
not necessarily playing out in its default mode. But you're using both


969
00:49:25.200 --> 00:49:28.100
energies to appease. Both energies. Both energies are


970
00:49:28.100 --> 00:49:31.500
being used one is not being used more than the other but


971
00:49:31.500 --> 00:49:34.900
you are finding the way that it can that it


972
00:49:34.900 --> 00:49:38.500
can work. You'll see more of bending energy


973
00:49:38.500 --> 00:49:40.200
in terms of like


974
00:49:41.300 --> 00:49:44.600
non-lateral compromise when you're


975
00:49:44.600 --> 00:49:47.500
talking about sinistry that comes up the most but it's it's


976
00:49:47.500 --> 00:49:50.000
definitely used in natal charts as well.


977
00:49:53.400 --> 00:49:56.400
You just made me feel better about my son's more


978
00:49:56.400 --> 00:49:56.600
Square.


979
00:49:57.600 --> 00:50:00.200
I'm glad because a lot of people look at their chart and


980
00:50:00.200 --> 00:50:03.500
the only thing they point out are all the squares and they're


981
00:50:03.500 --> 00:50:06.300
like, oh, you know life is just so hard and like


982
00:50:07.300 --> 00:50:10.400
If you would just use that you could do so many amazing things


983
00:50:10.400 --> 00:50:14.800
sun and Mars, especially sun and Mars can be you know,


984
00:50:14.800 --> 00:50:17.700
your personality your creative drive along with.


985
00:50:18.500 --> 00:50:20.600
actually doing something about it, so


986
00:50:23.200 --> 00:50:24.100
Yeah, that could be really great.


987
00:50:25.300 --> 00:50:28.200
My Aries Mars squares my fiance's Capricorn Mars and


988
00:50:28.200 --> 00:50:31.400
we talk about how that plays out. We're both stubborn in Conflict. Yeah, and


989
00:50:31.400 --> 00:50:34.100
then you have to break down again. You're talking


990
00:50:34.100 --> 00:50:37.300
about two Mars so planet of action, but now you're talking about somebody who is


991
00:50:39.800 --> 00:50:42.500
they're both these planets are actually hot-headed but in two


992
00:50:42.500 --> 00:50:45.500
different ways one of them gets upset first and


993
00:50:45.500 --> 00:50:48.500
then kind of cools down and it's no big deal later on


994
00:50:48.500 --> 00:50:51.700
the other one builds up over time and then unleashes Fury.


995
00:50:52.400 --> 00:50:55.700
So those are that's how


996
00:50:55.700 --> 00:50:57.100
you have to do it, but you have to realize that.


997
00:50:57.900 --> 00:51:00.700
One of you has to appease the


998
00:51:00.700 --> 00:51:03.200
the Aries the do it now


999
00:51:03.200 --> 00:51:06.300
and the other one has to appease the Capricorn the


1000
00:51:06.300 --> 00:51:09.700
long-term goals. This is one way you can look at it and taking areas


1001
00:51:09.700 --> 00:51:12.300
and Capricorn and that square is saying


1002
00:51:12.300 --> 00:51:15.600
you know what I'm going to create milestones for these long-term goals


1003
00:51:15.600 --> 00:51:18.300
that way the Aries person feels like they're getting something out


1004
00:51:18.300 --> 00:51:21.500
of this and the Capricorn person says, okay, but this isn't the


1005
00:51:21.500 --> 00:51:25.000
final we're just doing little Milestones. We're climbing the


1006
00:51:25.500 --> 00:51:28.800
ladder to achieve the goals. You can do this. You can do this. You can do this but


1007
00:51:28.800 --> 00:51:31.400
realize that this is the this is what we're actually aiming


1008
00:51:31.400 --> 00:51:34.500
for that's one way of how you appease those two energies


1009
00:51:34.500 --> 00:51:37.200
in a square. Otherwise, you just fight over it. No one


1010
00:51:37.200 --> 00:51:38.800
ever gets anything done because they are


1011
00:51:39.900 --> 00:51:42.100
Capricorn is very stubborn. Well, they both


1012
00:51:42.100 --> 00:51:45.300
are but they're both they're both stubborn because they both want to start things.


1013
00:51:50.300 --> 00:51:53.600
So Saturn score your son you would need time to learn on how


1014
00:51:53.600 --> 00:51:56.600
to shine. So Saturn is Father Time. Saturn


1015
00:51:56.600 --> 00:51:57.800
does create.


1016
00:52:00.100 --> 00:52:03.600
Opportunity when you slow down and when it's Square


1017
00:52:03.600 --> 00:52:05.700
your son often you want it now?


1018
00:52:06.500 --> 00:52:10.000
The sun wants to shine the sun wants to have fun The


1019
00:52:09.300 --> 00:52:12.500
Sun Also because it's it rules Leo


1020
00:52:12.500 --> 00:52:15.300
has to do with like I said fun and creativity and like


1021
00:52:15.300 --> 00:52:18.300
the the inner child Saturn says I want


1022
00:52:18.300 --> 00:52:21.600
structure and I want to be serious and have responsibility.


1023
00:52:21.600 --> 00:52:24.500
So you have to blend in. How can we be both


1024
00:52:24.500 --> 00:52:27.300
fun and responsible at the same time?


1025
00:52:27.300 --> 00:52:31.000
That's how you blend that. That's how you bend the energies. So


1026
00:52:30.800 --> 00:52:33.500
Capricorn still get in what Capricorn wants


1027
00:52:33.500 --> 00:52:36.100
with the responsibility of seriousness in the


1028
00:52:36.100 --> 00:52:38.800
long term goals, but the sun is like I want to do what I want.


1029
00:52:39.800 --> 00:52:42.200
I want to play around I want to be happy. How can


1030
00:52:42.200 --> 00:52:45.200
we be happy? What is it? We have to do with these two


1031
00:52:45.200 --> 00:52:48.500
energies and these two areas of life because they're sitting in different charts


1032
00:52:48.500 --> 00:52:51.100
in your different houses in your chart. How do we


1033
00:52:51.100 --> 00:52:54.600
take these two and blend them together to do you know


1034
00:52:54.600 --> 00:52:57.100
this whatever Saturn's whatever how Saturn are


1035
00:52:57.100 --> 00:53:01.500
sitting in appease that in responsibility, but with with


1036
00:53:00.500 --> 00:53:03.300
the sun and its house, how do you find that


1037
00:53:03.300 --> 00:53:04.400
right there?


1038
00:53:07.800 --> 00:53:10.300
all right, so, let me jump forward so


1039
00:53:12.200 --> 00:53:15.800
Like I said before both planets, they want to be equally considered.


1040
00:53:15.800 --> 00:53:18.500
You can't leave one out in a square. It won't work


1041
00:53:18.500 --> 00:53:21.700
the friction and the combat and frustration will


1042
00:53:21.700 --> 00:53:21.900
come out.


1043
00:53:23.100 --> 00:53:26.800
Oscillation can be the answer to resolve


1044
00:53:26.800 --> 00:53:30.200
but either way change is a result Saturn cannot


1045
00:53:29.200 --> 00:53:32.100
be Saturn the sun cannot just


1046
00:53:32.100 --> 00:53:35.100
be the sun. The sun says I want to have fun.


1047
00:53:35.100 --> 00:53:38.600
But with Saturn there you cannot just have fun.


1048
00:53:38.600 --> 00:53:41.100
You can't just be creative. You can't just


1049
00:53:41.100 --> 00:53:44.500
have your personality Shine without restriction Saturn comes


1050
00:53:44.500 --> 00:53:47.500
in and says no be a little bit more mature but more whatever.


1051
00:53:48.300 --> 00:53:52.300
But sadder by itself would want to be the discipline


1052
00:53:51.300 --> 00:53:54.700
the disciplinarian the one in authority


1053
00:53:54.700 --> 00:53:57.200
and then you know, you could if you're looking


1054
00:53:57.200 --> 00:54:00.700
at the lens of authority you could say. Oh, well the sun says don't be


1055
00:54:00.700 --> 00:54:03.700
the the whip, you


1056
00:54:03.700 --> 00:54:06.400
know, the guy with or guy or girl with the whip, you


1057
00:54:06.400 --> 00:54:09.700
know tone it down a little bit have a little bit of fun bring out


1058
00:54:09.700 --> 00:54:12.200
your inner child. We can still have authority we can still be


1059
00:54:12.200 --> 00:54:14.200
the boss, but we don't have to be that kind of Boss.


1060
00:54:14.900 --> 00:54:16.700
And that's another way that that plays out as well.


1061
00:54:18.200 --> 00:54:21.800
Oscillation, sometimes we're responsible. Sometimes we're


1062
00:54:21.800 --> 00:54:22.300
not but


1063
00:54:23.300 --> 00:54:26.500
Oscillation you have to do very carefully because you you have


1064
00:54:26.500 --> 00:54:29.800
to bring the other one back in pretty quickly. Otherwise, it


1065
00:54:29.800 --> 00:54:32.600
causes conflict again. So just being Saturn


1066
00:54:32.600 --> 00:54:36.400
you want to find a way where you're using both of them and changing


1067
00:54:35.400 --> 00:54:37.800
how they play out.


1068
00:54:40.100 --> 00:54:42.300
The next one that I talk about is the trying.


1069
00:54:43.200 --> 00:54:46.300
So the trying is should be


1070
00:54:46.300 --> 00:54:49.200
looking here as well. So here's the


1071
00:54:49.200 --> 00:54:52.300
square. So if we're talking about one planet here another planet here,


1072
00:54:52.300 --> 00:54:55.500
this is square and it is three three


1073
00:54:55.500 --> 00:54:58.200
houses away. One, two three, by the


1074
00:54:58.200 --> 00:54:59.400
way, I count differently.


1075
00:55:00.300 --> 00:55:03.700
Than other strollers, I do not know why maybe I'm


1076
00:55:03.700 --> 00:55:06.800
missing something but I don't know why they say first house.


1077
00:55:06.800 --> 00:55:09.100
They'll say four houses away is a square.


1078
00:55:09.100 --> 00:55:12.300
So and they'll count the one we're already in we'll be like the first house second


1079
00:55:12.300 --> 00:55:15.400
house third house fourth house, and I'm like, that's just a


1080
00:55:15.400 --> 00:55:15.900
weird way.


1081
00:55:16.900 --> 00:55:18.800
Of counting when you're saying away.


1082
00:55:19.900 --> 00:55:22.200
So I just say three houses away one two three


1083
00:55:22.200 --> 00:55:25.500
is square, but just know that you may see four houses


1084
00:55:25.500 --> 00:55:27.500
from the first planet is a square.


1085
00:55:28.300 --> 00:55:31.300
And then trying would be five even though for me trying is one


1086
00:55:31.300 --> 00:55:34.400
two three four houses away. So I count differently. I want


1087
00:55:34.400 --> 00:55:37.400
you guys to know that because you will see it differently in other


1088
00:55:37.400 --> 00:55:40.200
textbooks and other astrologers. I cannot get


1089
00:55:40.200 --> 00:55:43.300
behind the whole count the plan count the house. We're already in


1090
00:55:43.300 --> 00:55:47.000
when we're saying it's this many away that grammatically


1091
00:55:46.200 --> 00:55:49.000
just doesn't work for me. So I do it my own


1092
00:55:49.200 --> 00:55:51.800
way. But anyway, the next one we're talking about is the trying


1093
00:55:52.700 --> 00:55:55.400
And again, we're talking about major aspects here.


1094
00:55:56.400 --> 00:55:59.200
Beautiful explain your samples helpful for the first time feel like


1095
00:55:59.200 --> 00:56:02.200
actually understand this. Oh, thank you. Thank you Taylor. I appreciate


1096
00:56:02.200 --> 00:56:02.500
that.


1097
00:56:03.900 --> 00:56:06.800
Oops, there we go. So a


1098
00:56:06.800 --> 00:56:07.900
Trine this is one that


1099
00:56:09.200 --> 00:56:12.400
people go Gaga over right? Everyone's like, oh, it's beautiful.


1100
00:56:12.400 --> 00:56:15.700
It's harmonious. You have this lovely trying to explain


1101
00:56:15.700 --> 00:56:18.100
to you in a minute why that's not always a good thing.


1102
00:56:18.900 --> 00:56:19.900
In two different ways.


1103
00:56:20.600 --> 00:56:24.400
So the first thing is it is a gift because it's


1104
00:56:24.400 --> 00:56:27.600
a harmonious flow. It becomes a gift. It is


1105
00:56:27.600 --> 00:56:29.800
something that just comes easy to you.


1106
00:56:30.600 --> 00:56:33.300
And that's why a lot of people are so like, you know


1107
00:56:33.300 --> 00:56:36.500
tulips and butterflies over this in rainbows


1108
00:56:36.500 --> 00:56:39.200
and whatnot because they're just like it just works


1109
00:56:39.200 --> 00:56:42.500
don't have to worry about it. It's connected. We know it's connected


1110
00:56:42.500 --> 00:56:45.300
it sits in different areas of life. They fuse together. It's


1111
00:56:45.300 --> 00:56:46.000
just so great.


1112
00:56:46.800 --> 00:56:49.300
And often it is it's a hundred


1113
00:56:49.300 --> 00:56:52.600
and twenty degrees apart. Like I said three houses away is how


1114
00:56:52.600 --> 00:56:55.400
I count it. So if I use my own chart


1115
00:56:55.400 --> 00:56:56.400
again as an example


1116
00:56:57.900 --> 00:57:00.500
Here that's not


1117
00:57:00.500 --> 00:57:03.300
my chart. That is if I use my own chart as


1118
00:57:03.300 --> 00:57:06.900
an example here and I have Pluto in


1119
00:57:06.900 --> 00:57:09.200
my moon. So Pluto is down here in the third house


1120
00:57:09.200 --> 00:57:12.200
at 24 degrees. My moon is at 25


1121
00:57:12.200 --> 00:57:15.200
degrees. You can see that they're in the same element when they're in


1122
00:57:15.200 --> 00:57:18.400
the same element. Like I said, that's the typical definition of


1123
00:57:18.400 --> 00:57:21.600
a trying is that they are in the same element and that


1124
00:57:21.600 --> 00:57:23.400
there's a harmonious flow there.


1125
00:57:27.100 --> 00:57:28.800
but anyway


1126
00:57:30.200 --> 00:57:33.500
counting from here one house two house three house four house.


1127
00:57:33.500 --> 00:57:36.500
That's how I would do it. That's how I would do it in my head. Like I


1128
00:57:36.500 --> 00:57:39.900
said, it doesn't matter to me which way you decide to count. Whatever's easier


1129
00:57:39.900 --> 00:57:42.500
makes the most sense for you is you with this


1130
00:57:42.500 --> 00:57:45.700
Saturn in my third house it just


1131
00:57:45.700 --> 00:57:48.300
it the and in Libra the equation has to


1132
00:57:48.300 --> 00:57:52.000
balance out and when it comes to communication, I'm pretty


1133
00:57:51.400 --> 00:57:54.500
like I'm even I'm like a grammar Nazi


1134
00:57:54.500 --> 00:57:57.500
when it comes to writing even my emails


1135
00:57:57.500 --> 00:58:00.300
people. My wife sometimes is like, why are


1136
00:58:00.300 --> 00:58:03.500
why are you why do you punctual and she's very much into


1137
00:58:03.500 --> 00:58:06.900
grammar too, but she's like why your emails sound like you're so


1138
00:58:06.900 --> 00:58:09.100
serious and I'm like, I don't know


1139
00:58:09.100 --> 00:58:12.700
it bothers me when there's bad grammar. I want to make sure that there's


1140
00:58:12.700 --> 00:58:13.700
no miscommunication.


1141
00:58:14.500 --> 00:58:15.000
but anyway


1142
00:58:17.400 --> 00:58:21.200
Yes, my son and Moon are also true also


1143
00:58:20.200 --> 00:58:23.700
trying and so is Pluto and my


1144
00:58:23.700 --> 00:58:23.700
son.


1145
00:58:24.600 --> 00:58:27.400
We I might hit on this a little bit later. I


1146
00:58:27.400 --> 00:58:30.400
forgot to do a slide on it but aspect patterns which


1147
00:58:30.400 --> 00:58:33.400
isn't something I really want to get into anyway, but aspect patterns.


1148
00:58:33.400 --> 00:58:36.700
This is considered a grand Trine these


1149
00:58:36.700 --> 00:58:39.800
three planets are harmonious flow again. I'm


1150
00:58:39.800 --> 00:58:43.700
gonna tell you why that kind of sucks sometimes but actually


1151
00:58:42.700 --> 00:58:45.700
since I'm talking about aspect patterns


1152
00:58:45.700 --> 00:58:48.800
Neptune being opposite my son creates


1153
00:58:48.800 --> 00:58:51.800
what's called a kite. So it's a grand Trine with


1154
00:58:51.800 --> 00:58:54.800
two sex tiles which creates this opposition here,


1155
00:58:54.800 --> 00:58:57.400
which means Neptune for me is the pivot


1156
00:58:57.400 --> 00:59:00.500
point that I always have to balance out the energies


1157
00:59:00.500 --> 00:59:01.500
and the gifts.


1158
00:59:01.900 --> 00:59:04.100
from my grand trying so when it comes


1159
00:59:04.100 --> 00:59:07.200
to my seventh eleventh and third houses in order for me


1160
00:59:07.200 --> 00:59:11.700
to utilize all of these energies, I have to use Neptune


1161
00:59:10.700 --> 00:59:13.200
to be able to do it which is


1162
00:59:14.400 --> 00:59:17.100
compassion through teaching. It's really what it is.


1163
00:59:17.100 --> 00:59:20.300
And that what do you think I'm doing so that's kind


1164
00:59:20.300 --> 00:59:20.300
of


1165
00:59:21.600 --> 00:59:22.100
how it is.


1166
00:59:24.200 --> 00:59:27.300
And compassionate through experiences and relatability through


1167
00:59:27.300 --> 00:59:30.300
experiences as well, which my other channel is something


1168
00:59:30.300 --> 00:59:32.800
I've been kind of getting into as well.


1169
00:59:34.400 --> 00:59:37.600
I answered that yes, I love relief example so much easier understanding


1170
00:59:37.600 --> 00:59:38.900
awesome. I'll see if I can.


1171
00:59:40.300 --> 00:59:40.700
remember to do more


1172
00:59:41.500 --> 00:59:44.400
All right, so energy seems very easy and very natural between


1173
00:59:44.400 --> 00:59:47.500
these planets in a Trine and it does you don't even notice it.


1174
00:59:47.500 --> 00:59:48.300
That's the thing.


1175
00:59:49.100 --> 00:59:52.400
And that's important to know is a lot of people who have trains don't


1176
00:59:52.400 --> 00:59:55.800
even realize to the point where they take it for granted. They


1177
00:59:55.800 --> 00:59:58.200
don't realize how easy certain things are for them


1178
00:59:58.200 --> 01:00:00.200
in their life because they don't


1179
01:00:01.300 --> 01:00:03.200
they don't know any different for me.


1180
01:00:04.300 --> 01:00:07.400
My personality and my emotions go


1181
01:00:07.400 --> 01:00:10.300
hand in hand how I feel and how I express myself is just


1182
01:00:10.300 --> 01:00:13.900
it is what it is. Like I I'm not I'm


1183
01:00:13.900 --> 01:00:16.700
not conflicted feeling one


1184
01:00:16.700 --> 01:00:18.600
way and expressing myself another way.


1185
01:00:19.200 --> 01:00:22.500
Right, like if you had Sun either no aspect at


1186
01:00:22.500 --> 01:00:25.400
all. Like when you're looking at the aspect chart when I said earlier


1187
01:00:25.400 --> 01:00:28.200
here and I was showing you the glyphs in each one of these is


1188
01:00:28.200 --> 01:00:31.400
a relationship. All these empty boxes is that these planets


1189
01:00:31.400 --> 01:00:34.100
have no relationship to each other. So my moon in my


1190
01:00:34.100 --> 01:00:37.100
Mercury, I don't say what I feel if I say what I feel


1191
01:00:37.100 --> 01:00:40.500
it's not because I felt like saying what I felt it's because


1192
01:00:40.500 --> 01:00:41.500
I just chose to do it.


1193
01:00:43.300 --> 01:00:46.400
Okay, but my son and my my moon they


1194
01:00:46.400 --> 01:00:49.300
are inherently linked. It's very easy through my through


1195
01:00:49.300 --> 01:00:52.500
the way that I present myself. What I'm feeling like is


1196
01:00:52.500 --> 01:00:53.800
really hard to hide that.


1197
01:00:55.400 --> 01:00:56.600
Yes, very naturally.


1198
01:00:57.900 --> 01:01:00.000
So someone who can do a double.


1199
01:01:00.900 --> 01:01:03.200
Backhand spring would have a trying somewhere.


1200
01:01:05.800 --> 01:01:08.800
No, because that's more of a skill or


1201
01:01:08.800 --> 01:01:09.100
a talent.


1202
01:01:09.900 --> 01:01:12.700
This has to do with energy in


1203
01:01:12.700 --> 01:01:13.200
terms of like


1204
01:01:14.200 --> 01:01:17.300
so that's that's a combination of things. So


1205
01:01:17.300 --> 01:01:20.200
gymnastics has to do with


1206
01:01:20.200 --> 01:01:23.200
your Mars. A lot of people with Mars and Libra are


1207
01:01:23.200 --> 01:01:26.200
into like gymnastics and whatnot, Mars and Aries or into


1208
01:01:26.200 --> 01:01:26.700
gymnastics.


1209
01:01:27.600 --> 01:01:30.400
Sometimes they'll have a Jupiter that's in


1210
01:01:30.400 --> 01:01:33.800
there which makes them very easy to do like repetitious things.


1211
01:01:33.800 --> 01:01:36.200
So a double backhand spring Jupiter's probably


1212
01:01:36.200 --> 01:01:39.300
involved in there because it it's a


1213
01:01:39.300 --> 01:01:42.700
recurring cycle in a positive way and expansive


1214
01:01:42.700 --> 01:01:45.800
especially if they're the person who can do like 10 of them, but it


1215
01:01:45.800 --> 01:01:48.200
has that has more to do with their skills and their talents


1216
01:01:48.200 --> 01:01:51.300
and Venus will probably be in there too skills and talents


1217
01:01:51.300 --> 01:01:51.700
rather than


1218
01:01:53.800 --> 01:01:56.000
The flow of energy which is what I'm talking about.


1219
01:01:57.700 --> 01:02:00.600
I have a grand water trying between my sun and cancer Jupiter


1220
01:02:00.600 --> 01:02:04.100
Scorpio Saturn and Pisces. Yeah, so Jupiter Saturn


1221
01:02:03.100 --> 01:02:06.400
outer planets, but then you have your sun involved. So


1222
01:02:06.400 --> 01:02:09.400
a lot of long-term emotional energy


1223
01:02:09.400 --> 01:02:12.600
a lot of long-term intuition, especially when


1224
01:02:12.600 --> 01:02:13.200
it comes to like


1225
01:02:13.900 --> 01:02:16.200
higher education experiences and teaching


1226
01:02:17.100 --> 01:02:20.400
there and you're talking about Scorpio energy. So you're talking about just


1227
01:02:20.400 --> 01:02:23.200
kind of diving deep into the things you feel passionate about.


1228
01:02:24.600 --> 01:02:27.000
Is pretty easy, especially if there's some sort of


1229
01:02:27.700 --> 01:02:28.400
mystery involved?


1230
01:02:33.500 --> 01:02:37.500
And especially if there's some sort of nurturing but potential


1231
01:02:36.500 --> 01:02:38.600
nurturing involved as well.


1232
01:02:39.300 --> 01:02:40.400
Yeah, absolutely. Yeah.


1233
01:02:41.900 --> 01:02:44.300
And it just comes naturally to you. And that's the thing is you


1234
01:02:44.300 --> 01:02:47.600
don't have to think about it. You don't have to really try all that


1235
01:02:47.600 --> 01:02:48.300
hard. You just kind of


1236
01:02:49.300 --> 01:02:53.200
it is what it is. And that's the thing is when we have these so


1237
01:02:52.200 --> 01:02:55.100
a trying versus I'll answer that one real quick. So


1238
01:02:55.100 --> 01:02:58.500
try and versus a grand try a Trine is when you have here


1239
01:02:58.500 --> 01:03:01.900
I'll just go to this chart. That's not


1240
01:03:01.900 --> 01:03:03.600
a train 26.


1241
01:03:04.500 --> 01:03:07.500
Is this one have any? Yes Mercury right here 10 degrees.


1242
01:03:08.400 --> 01:03:11.400
And Uranus over here at 12 degrees is


1243
01:03:11.400 --> 01:03:14.600
a Trine it's cancer to Scorpio, but


1244
01:03:14.600 --> 01:03:17.400
you notice there's nothing up here in Pisces in my chart


1245
01:03:17.400 --> 01:03:21.000
in the air. You have three different trines.


1246
01:03:21.600 --> 01:03:24.400
All within the same element again. The element is


1247
01:03:24.400 --> 01:03:27.800
not crucial the sun. They could be 28 and


1248
01:03:27.800 --> 01:03:30.700
and two degrees and I could still form a grandshrine


1249
01:03:30.700 --> 01:03:33.400
with varying elements, but the energy is


1250
01:03:33.400 --> 01:03:36.400
harmoniously Flowing between these and it creates a triangle


1251
01:03:36.400 --> 01:03:39.300
pattern that you see here. It's an


1252
01:03:39.300 --> 01:03:39.800
aspect pattern.


1253
01:03:40.800 --> 01:03:43.100
And it's because this one shrines this one


1254
01:03:43.100 --> 01:03:46.300
this one shines this one and then this one shines back to the original. That's a


1255
01:03:46.300 --> 01:03:49.600
grand Trine a standard trying just one one


1256
01:03:49.600 --> 01:03:50.000
of those lines.


1257
01:03:54.400 --> 01:03:57.300
Sun Moon and ascendant Grand air trying yeah,


1258
01:03:57.300 --> 01:03:59.600
I don't have that but I have


1259
01:04:00.600 --> 01:04:00.900
something


1260
01:04:02.900 --> 01:04:06.400
hmm. It's not exactly sent similar. The


1261
01:04:05.400 --> 01:04:09.100
difference is I have Sun Moon Pluto. You


1262
01:04:08.100 --> 01:04:11.200
have Sun Moon ascendant. So yours has


1263
01:04:11.200 --> 01:04:12.200
to do with your physical body.


1264
01:04:15.100 --> 01:04:18.300
And anxiety can be a part of of that as


1265
01:04:18.300 --> 01:04:20.700
well. So you obviously have to be careful of that.


1266
01:04:22.400 --> 01:04:24.800
Let me click that. I seem to only have


1267
01:04:25.600 --> 01:04:28.900
a Trine with Chiron and ascendant week


1268
01:04:28.900 --> 01:04:31.200
with Jupiter. Yeah, we'd have to take a look at that but


1269
01:04:37.500 --> 01:04:39.400
Trying Chiron and Jupiter.


1270
01:04:41.200 --> 01:04:45.200
Chiron and Jupiter can expand your personal wounds, but you


1271
01:04:45.200 --> 01:04:48.200
can you can actually help heal others very


1272
01:04:48.200 --> 01:04:52.000
easily through teaching and through life experience that type


1273
01:04:51.400 --> 01:04:54.400
of energy is that you can other people can


1274
01:04:54.400 --> 01:04:57.600
feel better around you when you communicate your life experience to


1275
01:04:57.600 --> 01:04:59.500
them to help them get through something.


1276
01:05:01.800 --> 01:05:02.800
Let me keep going.


1277
01:05:04.500 --> 01:05:07.500
so these planets in a trying tend to come across as an


1278
01:05:07.500 --> 01:05:10.700
Easy Link, like I said or an automatic inclusion now


1279
01:05:10.700 --> 01:05:13.700
automatic inclusion, I think is extremely important because when


1280
01:05:13.700 --> 01:05:14.200
one


1281
01:05:15.200 --> 01:05:18.200
Is trying the other you don't get a choice


1282
01:05:18.200 --> 01:05:21.500
on which one is affected and if it


1283
01:05:21.500 --> 01:05:24.400
is included in how one planet is


1284
01:05:24.400 --> 01:05:27.200
aspected or one planet is being affected at all.


1285
01:05:27.200 --> 01:05:30.200
These two planets are linked. And yes, it's a


1286
01:05:30.200 --> 01:05:33.400
harmonious flow but it is unrestricted and there's nothing you


1287
01:05:33.400 --> 01:05:36.300
can do about it. That is where I start getting into the


1288
01:05:36.300 --> 01:05:39.300
you gotta watch outs, you know section of this


1289
01:05:39.300 --> 01:05:42.800
and I'm gonna get into that more in a second why shrines


1290
01:05:42.800 --> 01:05:43.500
are not always good.


1291
01:05:45.100 --> 01:05:48.800
They are considered positive by almost every single astrology


1292
01:05:48.800 --> 01:05:52.000
resource, but they can be taken for granted especially


1293
01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:54.400
grandtrines without.


1294
01:05:55.200 --> 01:05:56.000
I'm fortunate.


1295
01:05:57.400 --> 01:06:00.300
fortunate and not fortunate at the same time because kite aspects are not very easy to


1296
01:06:00.300 --> 01:06:03.600
deal with but it does allow me a pivot


1297
01:06:03.600 --> 01:06:06.400
point to actually access and utilize my


1298
01:06:06.400 --> 01:06:09.600
grant trying because Grant trying or trying in general


1299
01:06:10.500 --> 01:06:13.800
are often taken for granted because like I said before you


1300
01:06:13.800 --> 01:06:14.600
don't realize


1301
01:06:15.600 --> 01:06:18.500
that what you do easily.


1302
01:06:19.600 --> 01:06:23.500
You take it for granted because you don't realize that other people struggle


1303
01:06:22.500 --> 01:06:25.600
with that same thing. So it's


1304
01:06:25.600 --> 01:06:28.300
like, you know, let's say


1305
01:06:28.300 --> 01:06:31.300
Mercury and Mars are trying with each other. So it's very


1306
01:06:31.300 --> 01:06:34.000
easy for you to come to make a decision depending on


1307
01:06:34.100 --> 01:06:37.300
the sign obviously, but make a decision and act on it and get something done


1308
01:06:37.300 --> 01:06:40.100
just because you thought of doing it. Oh, I think I should


1309
01:06:40.100 --> 01:06:43.200
do this and then you do it and people are like, how did you


1310
01:06:43.200 --> 01:06:46.300
how do you always do that? And you're just like, what do


1311
01:06:46.300 --> 01:06:49.100
you mean I thought about it and I did it. It's like that's everybody can do


1312
01:06:49.100 --> 01:06:52.100
that. No, not everybody can do that. So many


1313
01:06:52.100 --> 01:06:55.300
people get lost in their thoughts. I'm one of them. It's very


1314
01:06:55.300 --> 01:06:55.800
difficult.


1315
01:06:56.800 --> 01:07:00.800
For me to act on every impulse


1316
01:06:59.800 --> 01:07:02.500
now I am you know,


1317
01:07:02.500 --> 01:07:05.200
I do I say that but at the


1318
01:07:05.200 --> 01:07:08.100
same time I'm a bad example. I do


1319
01:07:08.100 --> 01:07:09.600
have that trying actually but


1320
01:07:11.200 --> 01:07:15.100
There are a lot of people who can't do that. They have a


1321
01:07:15.100 --> 01:07:18.600
hard time acting on their ideas. What makes mine difficult


1322
01:07:18.600 --> 01:07:21.100
is so I'm just gonna show you mine. I do


1323
01:07:21.100 --> 01:07:25.100
have that actually five degrees more six degrees Mercury, so


1324
01:07:24.100 --> 01:07:27.300
I meant to be random but that's actually my chart.


1325
01:07:27.300 --> 01:07:30.200
So this here I I can do the things that I have


1326
01:07:30.200 --> 01:07:33.200
ideas for I can actually put it out there. So if you know kind of


1327
01:07:34.300 --> 01:07:37.900
You know, if you're in the vibe tribe and you know, what we do, you know,


1328
01:07:37.900 --> 01:07:40.300
we have so many businesses and so many things because


1329
01:07:40.300 --> 01:07:44.200
my Mercury is in the 11th House of hopes and dreams and for


1330
01:07:43.200 --> 01:07:46.300
me that trying with Mars says


1331
01:07:46.300 --> 01:07:49.300
I'm going to do them. There's no question whether I'm going


1332
01:07:49.300 --> 01:07:52.200
to do them Saturn has to do with timing and slow and


1333
01:07:52.200 --> 01:07:55.700
it frustrates me because I can't always do it and often.


1334
01:07:55.700 --> 01:07:58.100
I have to change my route because Pluto remember they go


1335
01:07:58.100 --> 01:07:59.800
in order, but also I have


1336
01:08:00.800 --> 01:08:03.800
My Mercury opposite in a


1337
01:08:03.800 --> 01:08:06.500
very loose orb of influence, but it's opposite my Uranus


1338
01:08:06.500 --> 01:08:09.500
and that can make it very difficult for me to stay on task


1339
01:08:09.500 --> 01:08:12.200
because I get bored easily because Gemini does


1340
01:08:12.200 --> 01:08:15.600
anyway, but then I have Uranus so I'm always trying to switch gears. The


1341
01:08:15.600 --> 01:08:18.200
reason why I have so many businesses and so many things that I do


1342
01:08:18.200 --> 01:08:21.200
is because I have to I have to have that because that's my


1343
01:08:21.200 --> 01:08:24.200
energy when I don't I I'm like


1344
01:08:24.200 --> 01:08:27.400
what can I do? What's next? What can I do? I need something to


1345
01:08:27.400 --> 01:08:30.000
do and that's just my energy and I've learned how to


1346
01:08:30.200 --> 01:08:30.400
do that.


1347
01:08:31.700 --> 01:08:34.000
I'm confused about the automatic inclusion because it seems like


1348
01:08:34.200 --> 01:08:37.800
all aspects automatically include both planets.


1349
01:08:38.700 --> 01:08:42.200
So when we were talking about oppositions, for


1350
01:08:42.200 --> 01:08:42.500
example


1351
01:08:43.600 --> 01:08:46.600
oppositions do not automatically include both


1352
01:08:46.600 --> 01:08:49.100
they do in the sense that they are


1353
01:08:49.100 --> 01:08:52.600
aspecting each other. So there's always some sort of element of


1354
01:08:52.600 --> 01:08:54.100
that planet.


1355
01:08:55.700 --> 01:08:57.500
impacting the other one, but


1356
01:08:59.400 --> 01:09:02.600
you can choose which which planet you're


1357
01:09:02.600 --> 01:09:05.700
leaning into. Whereas a trying you don't have that choice a


1358
01:09:05.700 --> 01:09:08.400
trying it it both of them are brought equally


1359
01:09:08.400 --> 01:09:11.700
at the same time and you don't get to really choose whichever one


1360
01:09:11.700 --> 01:09:14.300
is being activated is the one that is


1361
01:09:14.300 --> 01:09:17.800
being activated and the other one automatically it


1362
01:09:17.800 --> 01:09:20.100
happens. So to answer this, I'm gonna


1363
01:09:20.100 --> 01:09:22.500
tell you why I feel trying to be


1364
01:09:23.900 --> 01:09:25.400
not so fun.


1365
01:09:26.300 --> 01:09:27.600
if you have Saturn


1366
01:09:28.800 --> 01:09:31.200
like I do right now actually I just here we


1367
01:09:31.200 --> 01:09:34.500
go back to my chart. And again, we're not to trance it's


1368
01:09:34.500 --> 01:09:37.400
yet, but I'm going to jump into this if you have Saturn which


1369
01:09:37.400 --> 01:09:39.800
I do Saturn is over.


1370
01:09:42.500 --> 01:09:45.400
My moon, right? So Saturn is transiting my


1371
01:09:45.400 --> 01:09:47.800
moon and it's direct right now and


1372
01:09:49.600 --> 01:09:53.100
Saturn over the moon has its own implications and


1373
01:09:52.100 --> 01:09:55.200
they're not fun to deal with because you're talking


1374
01:09:55.200 --> 01:09:58.400
about the cold rigid Saturn you're talking about your emotions and


1375
01:09:58.400 --> 01:10:01.400
your emotional state. So this can bring depression. It


1376
01:10:01.400 --> 01:10:04.300
can bring isolation Minds in my seventh house. So even


1377
01:10:04.300 --> 01:10:07.900
in my partnership, I still felt lonely and that's


1378
01:10:07.900 --> 01:10:09.500
been happening for a while now.


1379
01:10:10.300 --> 01:10:13.700
Fortunately, it's releasing to use this energy positively


1380
01:10:13.700 --> 01:10:16.300
I had to really focus in on what these planets meant.


1381
01:10:16.300 --> 01:10:20.000
And which is why I'm okay so that


1382
01:10:19.100 --> 01:10:23.600
I can use Saturn's long-term pressure


1383
01:10:22.600 --> 01:10:25.500
with the moons. What


1384
01:10:25.500 --> 01:10:28.700
do I want? What's gonna make me feel emotionally secure especially


1385
01:10:28.700 --> 01:10:31.200
when it comes to seventh house matters for me. It was my own


1386
01:10:31.200 --> 01:10:34.100
business and making changes within these businesses.


1387
01:10:35.700 --> 01:10:38.600
Even in my partnership how I


1388
01:10:38.600 --> 01:10:42.000
how my wife and I interact and


1389
01:10:41.300 --> 01:10:44.100
how much time was I being


1390
01:10:44.100 --> 01:10:47.300
too independent was I detaching a


1391
01:10:47.300 --> 01:10:50.400
bit too much, you know from time to time or did I need to like find


1392
01:10:50.400 --> 01:10:53.500
my own independence? It was all about finding balance within that


1393
01:10:53.500 --> 01:10:55.700
and that's something that I worked on as well.


1394
01:10:56.700 --> 01:11:00.200
But it also impacted without my


1395
01:10:59.200 --> 01:11:03.100
say my son when


1396
01:11:02.100 --> 01:11:05.400
I felt down. I felt really down


1397
01:11:05.400 --> 01:11:08.400
my son was down as well. Meaning. I


1398
01:11:08.400 --> 01:11:12.100
felt like I was my light had


1399
01:11:11.100 --> 01:11:13.900
been like dimmed.


1400
01:11:14.500 --> 01:11:17.100
And then on top of that it's also with Pluto. So I have


1401
01:11:17.100 --> 01:11:20.200
this grant Shrine here. So Pluto was also so I


1402
01:11:20.200 --> 01:11:23.200
ended up having in here, you know, actually and I


1403
01:11:23.200 --> 01:11:26.900
had some of these conversations that we had like I would get really upset


1404
01:11:26.900 --> 01:11:29.300
in the middle of a conversation. I'm like, I I know


1405
01:11:29.300 --> 01:11:32.200
why I'm feeling like this and I have to stop but in the middle of


1406
01:11:32.200 --> 01:11:34.300
the first few words out of my mouth


1407
01:11:36.300 --> 01:11:39.300
You know, I I'm feeling a lot of stuff from you know


1408
01:11:39.300 --> 01:11:42.700
past relationships, which is really what this was, you


1409
01:11:42.700 --> 01:11:45.900
know, Pluto and Libra in the third house had to do with Communications within


1410
01:11:45.900 --> 01:11:48.200
past relationships and things being dredged up


1411
01:11:48.200 --> 01:11:51.500
that I hadn't dealt with that's what Saturn over my moon with the


1412
01:11:51.500 --> 01:11:54.600
sun with Pluto all had to deal with and then


1413
01:11:54.600 --> 01:11:57.300
you're also talking about your kids and then you're also talking about,


1414
01:11:57.300 --> 01:12:00.000
you know, your moods and


1415
01:12:00.200 --> 01:12:03.300
then you're also talking about like I said, it's the past it's


1416
01:12:03.300 --> 01:12:07.100
transition. So I had to choose to transform positively


1417
01:12:06.100 --> 01:12:09.400
in these areas, but I didn't have


1418
01:12:09.400 --> 01:12:12.300
a say as soon as the Moon is


1419
01:12:12.300 --> 01:12:14.300
activated. It's it's hitting all of this.


1420
01:12:15.200 --> 01:12:18.600
And when the sun is activated my moon and my Pluto automatically


1421
01:12:18.600 --> 01:12:21.500
activated I don't get to choose. That's the problem


1422
01:12:21.500 --> 01:12:24.400
in my opinion with a Trine


1423
01:12:24.400 --> 01:12:27.900
is you don't get to balance it out. It just is and that's


1424
01:12:27.900 --> 01:12:30.000
the way that I've seen it. I've never seen you be able to


1425
01:12:31.400 --> 01:12:34.100
If you look at anyone's chart, you look at your own chart you have it and you


1426
01:12:34.100 --> 01:12:37.500
have a trying you'll realize that when you're talking about


1427
01:12:37.500 --> 01:12:40.800
one of your planets and it's making a trying to the other that that


1428
01:12:40.800 --> 01:12:43.400
plan it's always included. So it's always


1429
01:12:43.400 --> 01:12:46.800
linked together. So it's like if you had if you


1430
01:12:46.800 --> 01:12:47.600
had the Sun.


1431
01:12:48.900 --> 01:12:51.100
Let me pick one this a little easier.


1432
01:12:54.700 --> 01:12:57.600
If you had Venus in this that's


1433
01:12:57.600 --> 01:13:00.400
too easy if you had the sun in the second house and you


1434
01:13:00.400 --> 01:13:04.100
I'll just use Venus in the sixth house. Then when


1435
01:13:03.100 --> 01:13:05.000
you're making money.


1436
01:13:05.900 --> 01:13:08.400
You're feeling really good when you're


1437
01:13:08.400 --> 01:13:10.800
not making money you're in the toilet.


1438
01:13:11.700 --> 01:13:13.500
There's no and the only way.


1439
01:13:14.500 --> 01:13:17.400
The only way to fix it is to to hit


1440
01:13:17.400 --> 01:13:19.400
one of those two either. I need to make money.


1441
01:13:20.200 --> 01:13:23.500
Or I need to get happy. Well, how do I get happy? It's


1442
01:13:23.500 --> 01:13:26.400
automatically linked to making money. So the only way to make me happy


1443
01:13:26.400 --> 01:13:29.600
is to use Venus's stuff. I need to buy myself


1444
01:13:29.600 --> 01:13:32.100
something. I need to make money. I need


1445
01:13:32.100 --> 01:13:35.800
to eat something because Taurus rules because Venus rules rules


1446
01:13:35.800 --> 01:13:36.300
food.


1447
01:13:37.400 --> 01:13:40.800
And it tanks yourself when you're personality and


1448
01:13:40.800 --> 01:13:43.600
your son is dimmed because it's Venus and


1449
01:13:43.600 --> 01:13:46.900
it's trying Venus your sense of


1450
01:13:46.900 --> 01:13:49.600
self-worth tanks at the same time. It's another way


1451
01:13:49.600 --> 01:13:52.200
that you can go into depression very easily because you can't


1452
01:13:53.400 --> 01:13:56.400
you can't do anything about it. You


1453
01:13:56.400 --> 01:13:59.200
have to build both of them up back at the same time. You can use


1454
01:13:59.200 --> 01:14:02.400
one to link the other one, but you have to choose


1455
01:14:02.400 --> 01:14:05.600
the one that's in the second with the


1456
01:14:05.600 --> 01:14:08.200
second house. It's money. Anyway, so in both of these it has


1457
01:14:08.200 --> 01:14:08.700
to do with money.


1458
01:14:09.800 --> 01:14:12.500
And I could change my job I could do whatever but whatever


1459
01:14:12.500 --> 01:14:15.400
it is. I have to focus on the first one to link in the second one


1460
01:14:15.400 --> 01:14:16.800
and it automatically comes.


1461
01:14:17.600 --> 01:14:20.300
Does Pluto often represent the past yes because it


1462
01:14:20.300 --> 01:14:22.400
talks about Cycles it talks about.


1463
01:14:23.900 --> 01:14:26.500
Transformation which requires the past into


1464
01:14:26.500 --> 01:14:29.500
the future using the present Saturn also represents


1465
01:14:29.500 --> 01:14:32.600
it in the terms of Father time and Karma, but


1466
01:14:32.600 --> 01:14:35.800
Pluto is very often the past.


1467
01:14:35.800 --> 01:14:38.300
So when you see trance, it's too Pluto. Usually it's


1468
01:14:38.300 --> 01:14:40.900
somebody from the past or something from the past as well.


1469
01:14:42.900 --> 01:14:45.100
Like I said earlier you can use


1470
01:14:45.100 --> 01:14:45.900
one planet.


1471
01:14:47.200 --> 01:14:50.400
In the trying to support the goals of the other. So that's really the


1472
01:14:50.400 --> 01:14:53.100
only way that you can pick and choose but you don't


1473
01:14:54.300 --> 01:14:57.600
When you choose the planet to affect the other planet, it


1474
01:14:57.600 --> 01:14:59.300
just automatically affected you're not.


1475
01:15:00.300 --> 01:15:03.300
Like choosing to only do this


1476
01:15:03.300 --> 01:15:06.300
and then not do this right now. It doesn't work that


1477
01:15:06.300 --> 01:15:08.400
way as soon as you do this. This is affected.


1478
01:15:10.100 --> 01:15:13.700
Hope I explaining that right the other ones don't work like that. The square


1479
01:15:13.700 --> 01:15:17.000
does kind of but the square


1480
01:15:16.200 --> 01:15:19.100
you can oscillate a little bit the trying you can't


1481
01:15:19.100 --> 01:15:21.800
the Trine is just it's an open. It's like


1482
01:15:23.200 --> 01:15:26.200
It's when you plug when you plug in AC adapter into the wall


1483
01:15:26.200 --> 01:15:29.700
power flows. The only way to stop


1484
01:15:29.700 --> 01:15:30.900
the power is to unplug it.


1485
01:15:33.800 --> 01:15:36.200
Assuming there's no power button on the thing that you're plugging in.


1486
01:15:37.300 --> 01:15:40.100
Right. It's just it's like an electric current. There's nothing you can


1487
01:15:40.100 --> 01:15:40.200
do.


1488
01:15:40.900 --> 01:15:43.100
They are so harmonious that they're always affecting each other.


1489
01:15:43.100 --> 01:15:43.400
Yes.


1490
01:15:44.200 --> 01:15:47.500
That's a trying no matter what you do. They were always affect


1491
01:15:47.500 --> 01:15:47.800
each other.


1492
01:15:48.700 --> 01:15:50.100
And again, this is something that


1493
01:15:51.300 --> 01:15:54.700
and you can't unplug it. You can't unplug it. That's the


1494
01:15:54.700 --> 01:15:56.900
thing right? You cannot unplug it.


1495
01:15:59.100 --> 01:16:02.200
It's always plugged in so you have to either.


1496
01:16:03.700 --> 01:16:06.200
Work at the source of where it's plugged in


1497
01:16:06.200 --> 01:16:09.500
to affect this or you have to affect this to


1498
01:16:09.500 --> 01:16:13.000
mitigate what's going on at the source, but you


1499
01:16:12.200 --> 01:16:15.200
don't get to pick and choose one and not do the


1500
01:16:15.200 --> 01:16:15.400
other.


1501
01:16:16.300 --> 01:16:19.500
They're always connected and that's that harmonious flow and the


1502
01:16:19.500 --> 01:16:22.500
big thing with trying. It's like I said before is that they can create they


1503
01:16:22.500 --> 01:16:24.200
can create contention.


1504
01:16:24.900 --> 01:16:27.300
Now if that's the right word, they can create a state


1505
01:16:27.300 --> 01:16:31.800
of contentment. That's the right word and laziness


1506
01:16:31.800 --> 01:16:34.400
so often people with trines again


1507
01:16:34.400 --> 01:16:37.200
don't realize that they have these gifts and then


1508
01:16:37.200 --> 01:16:40.400
they end up not even using them and that's what's really sad about


1509
01:16:40.400 --> 01:16:43.800
trying is that a lot of people don't even use the gifts


1510
01:16:43.800 --> 01:16:46.200
that they have because it's so easy for


1511
01:16:46.200 --> 01:16:49.300
them. They just brush it away and dismiss it and go about their


1512
01:16:49.300 --> 01:16:49.600
lives.


1513
01:16:51.800 --> 01:16:52.400
so you


1514
01:16:53.800 --> 01:16:56.900
'd that be read in order like you mentioned earlier.


1515
01:16:56.900 --> 01:16:59.600
So yeah, when whenever you're dealing with the aspects,


1516
01:16:59.600 --> 01:17:02.100
I would always go in order. Mine's a


1517
01:17:02.100 --> 01:17:02.900
little different because


1518
01:17:05.800 --> 01:17:08.300
It's a grand Shrine in my chart but in a try


1519
01:17:08.300 --> 01:17:11.400
and I would always go for the first one first to try to resolve


1520
01:17:11.400 --> 01:17:14.300
the second one if that doesn't work, then I


1521
01:17:14.300 --> 01:17:17.600
would take the second one and try to work backwards to resolve


1522
01:17:17.600 --> 01:17:19.300
the first one but time moves


1523
01:17:20.500 --> 01:17:23.700
Time flows forward and the energy flows Forward Air


1524
01:17:23.700 --> 01:17:26.200
from areas all the way to Pisces. So when you're resolving


1525
01:17:26.200 --> 01:17:29.300
things you always want to go in order unless you have to


1526
01:17:29.300 --> 01:17:32.500
go backward. The only time that kind of changes


1527
01:17:32.500 --> 01:17:35.300
sometimes somewhat is when there are


1528
01:17:35.300 --> 01:17:38.400
retrogrades involved and then you kind of have to realize that they're already


1529
01:17:38.400 --> 01:17:40.700
working inversely anyway or inwardly


1530
01:17:41.900 --> 01:17:44.000
So you have to approach it a little bit different, but that was


1531
01:17:44.700 --> 01:17:45.500
that was from the last class.


1532
01:17:46.600 --> 01:17:49.500
So that's we got through. The first four. These are called major


1533
01:17:49.500 --> 01:17:50.400
aspects guys.


1534
01:17:51.300 --> 01:17:54.900
Conjunction opposition square and


1535
01:17:54.900 --> 01:17:57.400
trying these are the major ones. They have the widest


1536
01:17:57.400 --> 01:18:00.100
orb of influence the conjunction being the full orb of


1537
01:18:00.100 --> 01:18:03.400
influence with each other and these are the four that you look at first and


1538
01:18:03.400 --> 01:18:06.400
I always look at in that order because I want to know what I'm


1539
01:18:06.400 --> 01:18:09.400
dealing with and I don't make any snap judgments until I've


1540
01:18:09.400 --> 01:18:11.800
looked at all of them and then considered All Aspects as well.


1541
01:18:15.200 --> 01:18:19.300
So now I'm going to get into what they call minor aspects minor aspects.


1542
01:18:19.300 --> 01:18:22.600
I don't like the term minor


1543
01:18:22.600 --> 01:18:25.300
aspects just because it kind of diminishes what


1544
01:18:25.300 --> 01:18:26.300
they mean. It feels like


1545
01:18:27.100 --> 01:18:30.200
they're unimportant. They are important. They're just not


1546
01:18:30.200 --> 01:18:33.900
as influential imminently influential.


1547
01:18:34.700 --> 01:18:37.900
As the other four, so


1548
01:18:37.900 --> 01:18:40.600
the first one I'm going to talk about is the sex tile so


1549
01:18:40.600 --> 01:18:43.600
when we talk about sex tile here, it's two houses away. It's


1550
01:18:43.600 --> 01:18:44.700
a 60 degree angle.


1551
01:18:47.500 --> 01:18:50.500
And this one is fun. I think


1552
01:18:50.500 --> 01:18:53.500
I think this one's a very interesting because sextiles are


1553
01:18:53.500 --> 01:18:56.300
extremely underrated and almost every


1554
01:18:56.300 --> 01:18:58.700
definition I've ever read about a sextile is wrong.


1555
01:19:00.900 --> 01:19:03.400
I found a few places a few resources where


1556
01:19:03.400 --> 01:19:06.400
they they hid it a bit more accurately. Usually it's


1557
01:19:06.400 --> 01:19:09.400
independent astrologers on their blogs and stuff. I'm like,


1558
01:19:09.400 --> 01:19:12.600
yeah, that's it. That's more. What a sex tile is when


1559
01:19:12.600 --> 01:19:16.100
you read sextile in most sources. They


1560
01:19:15.100 --> 01:19:18.400
always say it's a minor version


1561
01:19:18.400 --> 01:19:21.100
of the trying and it is not it is


1562
01:19:21.100 --> 01:19:24.100
not a minor version of the trying the trying isn't always


1563
01:19:24.100 --> 01:19:28.100
on connection. The sex tile is not the sex


1564
01:19:27.100 --> 01:19:30.400
tile is up to you. And I think that's


1565
01:19:30.400 --> 01:19:33.100
a beautiful thing. That's why I like this aspect all the


1566
01:19:33.100 --> 01:19:34.900
time when you're looking at someone's chart.


1567
01:19:35.800 --> 01:19:39.200
And you come down to the to the


1568
01:19:39.200 --> 01:19:42.100
aspects here like this is my chart. So when it comes


1569
01:19:42.100 --> 01:19:45.300
to Mars and Uranus, that's a sex tile.


1570
01:19:45.300 --> 01:19:48.700
I can choose to use Uranus


1571
01:19:48.700 --> 01:19:50.900
and it's my Mars is in my third house.


1572
01:19:52.200 --> 01:19:55.700
So I can when it comes to communication I can choose to


1573
01:19:55.700 --> 01:19:56.500
speak faster.


1574
01:19:57.600 --> 01:20:00.100
And sometimes to do sometimes when we're really


1575
01:20:00.100 --> 01:20:03.200
getting into it. I'm going back home and I go to Baltimore. I start talking to my friends. I'll really start


1576
01:20:03.200 --> 01:20:05.700
talking faster, but I don't do that all the time.


1577
01:20:06.700 --> 01:20:09.200
I don't have to anymore. I actually learn to slow my


1578
01:20:09.200 --> 01:20:12.100
speech down a little bit so that more people could understand what I'm saying.


1579
01:20:12.800 --> 01:20:15.300
But when I'm naturally speaking, I'm really passionate about it. Sometimes I


1580
01:20:15.300 --> 01:20:15.800
can get really fast.


1581
01:20:16.800 --> 01:20:19.300
That's how I used to speak when I was younger and people


1582
01:20:19.300 --> 01:20:22.300
like I don't know what you say. Can you go back and I still kind


1583
01:20:22.300 --> 01:20:24.200
of find a balance between the two I do speak.


1584
01:20:26.500 --> 01:20:29.000
I do speak faster than some other people and I


1585
01:20:29.300 --> 01:20:32.300
use Uranus sometimes as well because it's I can


1586
01:20:32.300 --> 01:20:35.400
create uniqueness in my voice


1587
01:20:35.400 --> 01:20:38.800
if I want to but I don't have to I can just speak normal. But


1588
01:20:38.800 --> 01:20:42.100
this does sometimes play itself out. My voice


1589
01:20:41.100 --> 01:20:44.100
does have like people have a hard time figuring out


1590
01:20:44.100 --> 01:20:45.200
where I'm from sometimes.


1591
01:20:46.500 --> 01:20:49.800
That's not just Mercury and Gemini. It's it's because


1592
01:20:49.800 --> 01:20:51.600
my Mercury is trying my Mars.


1593
01:20:52.200 --> 01:20:54.100
and my Mars is sextile my


1594
01:20:55.800 --> 01:20:58.300
Uranus and my Uranus is opposite my Mercury so it


1595
01:20:58.300 --> 01:21:01.300
comes out that it becomes very quick and Rapid


1596
01:21:01.300 --> 01:21:04.300
Fire and I have to be careful because sometimes


1597
01:21:05.300 --> 01:21:08.300
If I speak faster, it makes it


1598
01:21:08.300 --> 01:21:11.200
a little bit easier for me. So if I start picking up the pace like this and I'm talking to you guys.


1599
01:21:11.200 --> 01:21:14.500
I'm actually keeping up with my thoughts in my head kind of.


1600
01:21:15.500 --> 01:21:18.500
But obviously you can get yourself tongue twisted


1601
01:21:18.500 --> 01:21:21.100
a little bit sometimes so I


1602
01:21:21.100 --> 01:21:22.500
like I said, I slow it down.


1603
01:21:24.300 --> 01:21:27.400
I've been so excited to hear about sextile since that's the most of my


1604
01:21:27.400 --> 01:21:30.200
aspects. I also talked fast. Yeah, you can choose to


1605
01:21:30.200 --> 01:21:33.300
you can choose to talk fast. You can depending on what's aspected obviously.


1606
01:21:34.400 --> 01:21:34.500
so


1607
01:21:35.900 --> 01:21:38.400
so like I said, that's it's a


1608
01:21:38.400 --> 01:21:41.400
choice. I can choose to slow down. I


1609
01:21:41.400 --> 01:21:44.700
can choose to go faster. I can choose when I


1610
01:21:44.700 --> 01:21:47.100
take a break when I


1611
01:21:47.100 --> 01:21:50.000
get really passionate involved. I can pause for a second.


1612
01:21:50.600 --> 01:21:53.100
I can turn off that switch and then turn it back on


1613
01:21:53.100 --> 01:21:53.700
when I'm ready.


1614
01:21:55.200 --> 01:21:58.700
But it is a 60 degree apart direct when it's direct


1615
01:21:58.700 --> 01:22:02.400
at 60 degrees apart aspect. It's opportunity. You


1616
01:22:01.400 --> 01:22:04.600
can use it which is


1617
01:22:04.600 --> 01:22:07.100
why I like it so much. It is harmonious which they get that


1618
01:22:07.100 --> 01:22:07.900
right, but it is


1619
01:22:09.700 --> 01:22:12.300
Sometimes a negative and that's important to know


1620
01:22:12.300 --> 01:22:15.300
as well that sextiles just because they're harmonious in a


1621
01:22:15.300 --> 01:22:18.400
different way than trying to always on that can create negativity. It


1622
01:22:18.400 --> 01:22:18.900
can create.


1623
01:22:19.600 --> 01:22:22.400
Stagnancy for a trying a sex


1624
01:22:22.400 --> 01:22:25.500
tile depends on the planets that are being affected


1625
01:22:25.500 --> 01:22:28.600
in what houses and what else is going on. You could


1626
01:22:28.600 --> 01:22:31.100
be bringing something in that you shouldn't be


1627
01:22:31.100 --> 01:22:34.800
bringing in and sometimes the circumstances will


1628
01:22:34.800 --> 01:22:37.200
bring in and activate a sex tile.


1629
01:22:37.900 --> 01:22:41.900
So this is like you don't get 100% choice,


1630
01:22:40.900 --> 01:22:43.500
but for the most part you


1631
01:22:43.500 --> 01:22:46.600
can choose when to use a sextile and when not to but the


1632
01:22:46.600 --> 01:22:48.700
opportunity is there and I like that.


1633
01:22:49.500 --> 01:22:52.500
It's not always obviously available. Sometimes you


1634
01:22:52.500 --> 01:22:55.800
actually have to look into your chart to understand that those


1635
01:22:55.800 --> 01:22:58.600
two energies can go together a


1636
01:22:58.600 --> 01:23:01.200
good for instance is in my own chart when I


1637
01:23:01.200 --> 01:23:05.100
go back here is Pluto at 24 degrees and Neptune here


1638
01:23:05.100 --> 01:23:08.300
at 25 degrees realizing that I could


1639
01:23:08.300 --> 01:23:11.200
use my experiences and tell my stories to really


1640
01:23:11.200 --> 01:23:14.800
have an impact on people in my communication when I'm giving one-on-one,


1641
01:23:14.800 --> 01:23:18.200
especially in any sort of authoritarian orthought


1642
01:23:17.200 --> 01:23:20.300
not authoritarian authoritative man or


1643
01:23:20.300 --> 01:23:23.400
anything that I have knowledge of a subject if it's online or if


1644
01:23:23.400 --> 01:23:26.700
I'm physically doing the communication understanding that


1645
01:23:26.700 --> 01:23:29.900
if I either have compassion for people who are learning or


1646
01:23:29.900 --> 01:23:32.800
if I use my own stories and


1647
01:23:32.800 --> 01:23:35.400
experiences to link that into


1648
01:23:35.400 --> 01:23:38.400
what I'm talking about that there's a positive impact


1649
01:23:38.400 --> 01:23:41.600
there, but I don't always realize while I'm talking


1650
01:23:41.600 --> 01:23:44.600
that I can use my own life experiences. So that's


1651
01:23:44.600 --> 01:23:46.900
that's my own personal like


1652
01:23:47.900 --> 01:23:50.200
Sometimes I forget that I can do that


1653
01:23:50.200 --> 01:23:51.400
and also.


1654
01:23:53.400 --> 01:23:56.600
When I was creating music, I also have a sex talk from Neptune to


1655
01:23:56.600 --> 01:23:58.300
my moon and I was creating music.


1656
01:23:59.400 --> 01:24:02.300
Sometimes I would not I would get hung up


1657
01:24:02.300 --> 01:24:05.300
on other people and what they felt about my music


1658
01:24:05.300 --> 01:24:08.400
and instead of allowing myself


1659
01:24:08.400 --> 01:24:11.300
to really connect and be different in my music


1660
01:24:11.300 --> 01:24:15.300
and I had to oscillate between that because I always created music


1661
01:24:14.300 --> 01:24:17.200
that was very future oriented.


1662
01:24:19.400 --> 01:24:22.100
But I was always afraid to kind of put it out because I


1663
01:24:22.100 --> 01:24:23.300
was afraid to be judged on it.


1664
01:24:24.300 --> 01:24:25.800
And that's kind of how that played out for me.


1665
01:24:27.100 --> 01:24:30.400
So when we're talking about the sense of stagnancy for a sex


1666
01:24:30.400 --> 01:24:34.300
tile, it's more in the in the case of a missed


1667
01:24:33.300 --> 01:24:36.400
opportunity. It's potential energy


1668
01:24:36.400 --> 01:24:39.000
without kinetic sometimes so sometimes you have to


1669
01:24:39.200 --> 01:24:42.600
look into your own chart and say do I have a sex tile to anything and


1670
01:24:42.600 --> 01:24:45.800
then you have to analyze the two and be like, oh man. Yeah, sometimes


1671
01:24:45.800 --> 01:24:48.200
I have done that sometimes I've used this other times.


1672
01:24:48.200 --> 01:24:51.700
I haven't and then you can see it as a talent


1673
01:24:51.700 --> 01:24:53.600
as an opportunity to use it in the future.


1674
01:24:54.800 --> 01:24:57.300
It can be considered a pathway for growth because


1675
01:24:57.300 --> 01:25:00.500
it's a hidden talent. It gives you the opportunity to


1676
01:25:00.500 --> 01:25:03.200
evolve something you're doing kind of like what I said when


1677
01:25:03.200 --> 01:25:06.600
I get into teaching teaching spirituality really allows


1678
01:25:06.600 --> 01:25:09.500
me to impact a lot of people on a very personal level


1679
01:25:09.500 --> 01:25:12.100
and it's something that I had to infuse into my own


1680
01:25:12.100 --> 01:25:15.600
identity as well that I hadn't done


1681
01:25:15.600 --> 01:25:18.200
before because we're talking about the fifth and the third house.


1682
01:25:19.300 --> 01:25:22.200
Taking a hobby and turning it into a career is another one but


1683
01:25:22.200 --> 01:25:25.500
that is with other energies that are infused.


1684
01:25:28.400 --> 01:25:32.700
Consider positively severely underrated 100% consider


1685
01:25:31.700 --> 01:25:34.000
weak minor aspect, but it can be


1686
01:25:34.200 --> 01:25:37.700
highly transformational. Once you understand where your sex tiles are. You can


1687
01:25:37.700 --> 01:25:39.600
there's just so much that you're gonna unlock.


1688
01:25:40.500 --> 01:25:43.700
And a better description for this energy would be cooperative since


1689
01:25:43.700 --> 01:25:47.100
the energy support each other upon request. So that's


1690
01:25:46.100 --> 01:25:49.100
kind of my way of looking at it is


1691
01:25:49.100 --> 01:25:52.200
that one up one energy cooperates with the other


1692
01:25:52.200 --> 01:25:55.300
and and create say kind of a support


1693
01:25:55.300 --> 01:25:57.600
for the other one in like in its own way.


1694
01:25:58.700 --> 01:26:01.700
But that's the sex tile and like I


1695
01:26:01.700 --> 01:26:03.900
said, I really like sex tiles. I think they're important to understand.


1696
01:26:05.700 --> 01:26:08.700
But they're not they're not an always connection. So


1697
01:26:08.700 --> 01:26:09.600
when people lump


1698
01:26:10.300 --> 01:26:13.500
Or resources lump sextile and trying together. It


1699
01:26:13.500 --> 01:26:16.200
really bothers me because they're really not at all


1700
01:26:16.200 --> 01:26:18.600
the same aside from a harmonious flow.


1701
01:26:19.800 --> 01:26:21.000
between the two


1702
01:26:25.400 --> 01:26:27.400
boom semi-sexile


1703
01:26:28.100 --> 01:26:31.100
it's funny because it sounds like it would be very similar but it kind of


1704
01:26:31.100 --> 01:26:34.400
has the opposite effect when we're talking about a


1705
01:26:34.400 --> 01:26:35.100
semi-sexile.


1706
01:26:35.900 --> 01:26:38.100
We're talking about the next house over.


1707
01:26:38.900 --> 01:26:41.800
the semi sextile is the next door neighbor and


1708
01:26:41.800 --> 01:26:44.100
this is one I talk about in a lot


1709
01:26:44.100 --> 01:26:46.100
of people's charts because a lot of people


1710
01:26:48.700 --> 01:26:51.400
Have a very difficult time understanding this


1711
01:26:51.400 --> 01:26:54.600
Angie says if something is sextile Chiron, is


1712
01:26:54.600 --> 01:26:57.200
it a challenge? It can be a challenge it obviously depends


1713
01:26:57.200 --> 01:27:01.100
on everything that's involved. It can also be an opportunity to find


1714
01:27:00.100 --> 01:27:03.100
healing in a place that you may not


1715
01:27:03.100 --> 01:27:06.500
have looked before so whatever that plan it is and wherever it's


1716
01:27:06.500 --> 01:27:09.900
sitting you may not have realized that by utilizing that energy you


1717
01:27:09.900 --> 01:27:12.500
could actually work on healing yourself and healing


1718
01:27:12.500 --> 01:27:12.900
other people.


1719
01:27:14.600 --> 01:27:17.600
So it can be a challenge depending how it's


1720
01:27:17.600 --> 01:27:20.500
affected because Chiron is your wound. It can


1721
01:27:20.500 --> 01:27:23.600
be that in certain circumstances. Sometimes that energy can


1722
01:27:23.600 --> 01:27:24.400
be painful.


1723
01:27:25.100 --> 01:27:28.800
But conversely you can also use it to to heal.


1724
01:27:29.800 --> 01:27:32.300
A semi sextile at 30 degrees one house


1725
01:27:32.300 --> 01:27:36.500
over is an agitation. It's very rarely. Although


1726
01:27:35.500 --> 01:27:38.800
sometimes mildly positive. It


1727
01:27:38.800 --> 01:27:41.600
is almost always an agitation. It is


1728
01:27:41.600 --> 01:27:44.900
minor Discord. It's nothing like a square but it


1729
01:27:44.900 --> 01:27:48.100
does create a little bit of whence when


1730
01:27:47.100 --> 01:27:50.900
something happens and then you have a semi-sexile in


1731
01:27:50.900 --> 01:27:53.600
the mix. It's like when things happen but


1732
01:27:53.600 --> 01:27:54.900
not with this.


1733
01:27:56.100 --> 01:28:00.200
It's kind of like I don't I don't mess with this is how


1734
01:28:00.200 --> 01:28:00.800
I kind of read it.


1735
01:28:01.700 --> 01:28:04.800
So a direct is 30 degrees apart. Like


1736
01:28:04.800 --> 01:28:08.800
I said next door neighbors, they don't integrate easily causing


1737
01:28:07.800 --> 01:28:10.700
disharmony minor disarmony


1738
01:28:10.700 --> 01:28:13.300
between them. It's not that they don't understand each other. It's


1739
01:28:13.300 --> 01:28:15.700
just they don't work well together. It's like neighbors that


1740
01:28:16.900 --> 01:28:19.200
you're you're kind of neighborly, but


1741
01:28:19.200 --> 01:28:22.200
not really you just they live there. I live here. We don't really talk.


1742
01:28:24.700 --> 01:28:28.000
Has a cause and effect type of vibe and are inherently


1743
01:28:27.300 --> 01:28:30.100
linked a lot of people don't realize.


1744
01:28:31.100 --> 01:28:34.200
how these planets are linked together because


1745
01:28:35.400 --> 01:28:38.200
the first planet when it creates a 30 degree and it's


1746
01:28:38.200 --> 01:28:41.600
very specific. It's within like a degree to two degrees. It's very


1747
01:28:41.600 --> 01:28:43.800
tight orb of influence on this one.


1748
01:28:46.100 --> 01:28:46.900
when you have


1749
01:28:48.100 --> 01:28:51.300
again, I use my chart. I have one. I have one's very difficult.


1750
01:28:52.200 --> 01:28:53.200
in my opinion


1751
01:28:54.200 --> 01:28:54.500
so


1752
01:28:55.900 --> 01:28:56.200
when I


1753
01:28:57.500 --> 01:29:00.400
Go for my North Node which again is like life purpose


1754
01:29:00.400 --> 01:29:03.100
in the 12th houses, like spiritual empathy for older people


1755
01:29:03.100 --> 01:29:06.300
empathy for families spiritual nurturing things like


1756
01:29:06.300 --> 01:29:09.100
that, especially through transformation in the occult and


1757
01:29:09.100 --> 01:29:13.000
things like that and realizing that sometimes things that are very


1758
01:29:12.100 --> 01:29:15.100
close to my heart have to die off in order for me


1759
01:29:15.100 --> 01:29:15.800
to evolve.


1760
01:29:16.600 --> 01:29:19.500
Ah that's been very difficult for me


1761
01:29:19.500 --> 01:29:22.700
and it creates an agitation because it it affects my


1762
01:29:22.700 --> 01:29:26.100
ascendant and this is the example that


1763
01:29:26.100 --> 01:29:29.400
I use towards the beginning of class here is that this 13 degrees in this


1764
01:29:29.400 --> 01:29:32.400
13 degrees whenever my North Node the things I'm supposed


1765
01:29:32.400 --> 01:29:35.200
to be doing in life happen, they make


1766
01:29:35.200 --> 01:29:38.300
me feel like I don't know who I am anymore.


1767
01:29:38.300 --> 01:29:41.100
They make me feel like I can't do the things I want to


1768
01:29:41.100 --> 01:29:43.800
do or like more importantly that I can't be myself.


1769
01:29:44.900 --> 01:29:45.100
and


1770
01:29:46.500 --> 01:29:50.300
it was really difficult for me to teach actually it


1771
01:29:49.300 --> 01:29:52.300
took a year of us


1772
01:29:52.300 --> 01:29:55.100
knowing that we wanted to do Mr. We had


1773
01:29:55.100 --> 01:29:58.700
just Incorporated Mystic Rebels. It was


1774
01:29:58.700 --> 01:30:01.300
like six more months before we really got into social media and


1775
01:30:01.300 --> 01:30:04.300
the three more but it was about a year from the


1776
01:30:04.300 --> 01:30:07.300
point where I decided, you know, I probably should be


1777
01:30:07.300 --> 01:30:10.300
teaching I want to teach and then to the


1778
01:30:10.300 --> 01:30:13.400
point where I actually did my first class that was a year time because


1779
01:30:13.400 --> 01:30:16.200
I felt like I wasn't supposed to I felt like


1780
01:30:16.200 --> 01:30:19.500
I wasn't not even that I wasn't capable of doing it, but


1781
01:30:19.500 --> 01:30:19.700
just that


1782
01:30:20.800 --> 01:30:24.000
I mean a little bit of that but just just


1783
01:30:23.300 --> 01:30:26.400
didn't feel fun to me didn't feel like that was


1784
01:30:26.400 --> 01:30:29.900
my creative expression. That didn't feel like my my purpose.


1785
01:30:30.700 --> 01:30:33.400
so I've and I still have this feeling it's so weird


1786
01:30:33.400 --> 01:30:33.600
like


1787
01:30:34.500 --> 01:30:37.300
It's just minor Discord. It's like


1788
01:30:37.300 --> 01:30:39.900
doing this automatically affects this.


1789
01:30:41.400 --> 01:30:43.800
In an agitating way and I feel like I'm not supposed to be doing this.


1790
01:30:46.500 --> 01:30:49.500
So it's something that you have to resolve on your own and it


1791
01:30:49.500 --> 01:30:52.500
works in again counterclockwise order


1792
01:30:52.500 --> 01:30:55.200
with the sign. So I have to resolve this first I


1793
01:30:55.200 --> 01:30:58.800
had to do this to then allow this


1794
01:30:58.800 --> 01:31:00.100
and then I also have to work.


1795
01:31:01.200 --> 01:31:04.300
I work inversely on this one too. I have to appease this one


1796
01:31:04.300 --> 01:31:07.200
is the way I see a semi sextile. So I have to


1797
01:31:07.200 --> 01:31:10.400
be able to teach the way I want to teach have fun doing


1798
01:31:10.400 --> 01:31:13.300
it and not be so concerned with what other


1799
01:31:13.300 --> 01:31:16.100
people like I got to do it. It's in the first house. I have to do it


1800
01:31:16.100 --> 01:31:19.300
my own way. That was extremely important if I could do it my


1801
01:31:19.300 --> 01:31:22.200
own way, then I'll go ahead and do it and that's what we've been doing


1802
01:31:22.200 --> 01:31:22.700
is we've been


1803
01:31:25.300 --> 01:31:28.600
we've been making sure that when I do these things it's on my


1804
01:31:28.600 --> 01:31:31.500
terms and that's been allowing this to move forward but


1805
01:31:31.500 --> 01:31:32.300
when it was like


1806
01:31:33.700 --> 01:31:37.000
When I was first thinking about doing teaching astrology,


1807
01:31:36.400 --> 01:31:39.400
I was thinking about the whole Mars in


1808
01:31:39.400 --> 01:31:42.500
Aries means this Mars in the first house means


1809
01:31:42.500 --> 01:31:45.100
this Venus and Aries means this


1810
01:31:45.100 --> 01:31:48.500
and like I was like, no I can't do that. I don't want


1811
01:31:48.500 --> 01:31:51.400
to do that. There's nothing creative or fun about that. And that's


1812
01:31:51.400 --> 01:31:54.500
the Leo here. There's nothing creative about that style of


1813
01:31:54.500 --> 01:31:57.000
teaching anybody. Can Google that. Why am I going to repeat this?


1814
01:31:58.100 --> 01:32:01.500
So I don't mind doing it for social media, but in terms of like teaching


1815
01:32:01.500 --> 01:32:06.200
and the reason I don't for social media is there's nothing impacting with


1816
01:32:04.200 --> 01:32:07.100
any of this. I don't have


1817
01:32:07.100 --> 01:32:10.100
to worry about that. So it just it is what it is.


1818
01:32:10.100 --> 01:32:12.100
So that's how that manifests.


1819
01:32:13.400 --> 01:32:16.200
Tell them I disagree. Well, that's me had nothing to


1820
01:32:16.200 --> 01:32:18.800
do with anyone else. That's my internal Discord.


1821
01:32:20.700 --> 01:32:23.200
Your 12th House North there's semi sex tells your Senate. Yeah,


1822
01:32:23.200 --> 01:32:26.400
it's really where you have to find a creative


1823
01:32:26.400 --> 01:32:29.500
way to make sure that the second planet


1824
01:32:29.500 --> 01:32:32.300
and that's what it is is the first one affects the second one. So


1825
01:32:32.300 --> 01:32:35.800
you have to go to the second one in the semi sex tile and say, okay. How do


1826
01:32:35.800 --> 01:32:38.300
we make you happy with this and you'll see it all


1827
01:32:38.300 --> 01:32:41.100
the time and people's charts like I did this and this but then I


1828
01:32:41.100 --> 01:32:44.700
can't do this because this is the problem and I'm reading


1829
01:32:44.700 --> 01:32:47.500
it in their chart and like, you know, they are inherently linked


1830
01:32:47.500 --> 01:32:50.800
so you can resolve this energy, but it's not


1831
01:32:50.800 --> 01:32:51.700
easy you have to


1832
01:32:52.600 --> 01:32:55.000
you have to work with the energies to resolve it every single


1833
01:32:55.300 --> 01:32:58.200
one of these energies can be resolved understanding what type of


1834
01:32:58.200 --> 01:33:01.700
energy you're dealing with is the step closer to


1835
01:33:01.700 --> 01:33:04.100
being able to resolve it. But the whole purpose of


1836
01:33:04.100 --> 01:33:07.400
learning why a 30 degree in a 60 degree are completely


1837
01:33:07.400 --> 01:33:10.300
different versus a 90 and 120 degree which is you know,


1838
01:33:10.300 --> 01:33:11.200
square and trying


1839
01:33:12.200 --> 01:33:15.300
It's extremely important because the flow of energy tells you


1840
01:33:15.300 --> 01:33:18.200
okay, if I want to accomplish this and I


1841
01:33:18.200 --> 01:33:21.300
have to plan a square. I know that they're in conflict


1842
01:33:21.300 --> 01:33:24.400
in order to resolve the conflict. I have to appease both


1843
01:33:24.400 --> 01:33:27.300
of them. That means we have to do something creative to make sure that both


1844
01:33:27.300 --> 01:33:29.700
of them in their areas that they sit in are happy.


1845
01:33:30.800 --> 01:33:33.300
With the semi-sexile the second one


1846
01:33:33.300 --> 01:33:36.300
is usually the issue when you do the first one it affects the second one.


1847
01:33:38.600 --> 01:33:41.200
Your Trailblazer teacher I have to be and I


1848
01:33:41.200 --> 01:33:42.700
hope that it comes out that way.


1849
01:33:43.800 --> 01:33:46.300
So you work with the first plan to appease the conflict


1850
01:33:46.300 --> 01:33:49.400
the second one technically I yes, but I


1851
01:33:49.400 --> 01:33:52.500
work I work first with the second one


1852
01:33:52.500 --> 01:33:55.900
to know what needs to be appeased so


1853
01:33:55.900 --> 01:33:59.000
that when I work with the first one I can then factor


1854
01:33:58.200 --> 01:34:01.300
that in so I actually in a semi-sex style.


1855
01:34:01.300 --> 01:34:04.500
I kind of do it backwards because I know that the effect is


1856
01:34:04.500 --> 01:34:07.600
to the second one. So I need to know what's what's your


1857
01:34:07.600 --> 01:34:10.300
problem number two? What's how do


1858
01:34:10.300 --> 01:34:13.100
we resolve this conflict once we resolved this


1859
01:34:13.100 --> 01:34:16.400
conflict and I know what it is. That's bothering you I can


1860
01:34:16.400 --> 01:34:19.600
go back to the first planet and say okay in order to still


1861
01:34:19.600 --> 01:34:22.100
do this. We have to make some changes to make sure that


1862
01:34:22.100 --> 01:34:25.400
we round about hit this one and it feels right


1863
01:34:25.400 --> 01:34:28.500
and then it grows into a strength and that's


1864
01:34:28.500 --> 01:34:31.200
the thing that that I think I didn't write on here,


1865
01:34:31.200 --> 01:34:34.100
but I think it's important to understand. It's that my sex how can be


1866
01:34:34.100 --> 01:34:37.700
a strength because it's the first planet supports the


1867
01:34:37.700 --> 01:34:39.300
second planet in order.


1868
01:34:40.100 --> 01:34:43.400
Once you appease how to make them work together the first


1869
01:34:43.400 --> 01:34:46.500
one becomes the support and feeds into the second


1870
01:34:46.500 --> 01:34:49.500
because the second one doesn't have the knowledge of the


1871
01:34:49.500 --> 01:34:52.900
first one the first one's like hey take my wisdom and


1872
01:34:52.900 --> 01:34:55.400
use it to be yourself for us with


1873
01:34:55.400 --> 01:34:58.500
the North Node in the 12th house. Whatever this North Node represents


1874
01:34:58.500 --> 01:35:01.500
seems I'm not even showing you whatever this North Node represents here.


1875
01:35:02.800 --> 01:35:05.200
It's going to feed in to create a


1876
01:35:05.200 --> 01:35:08.500
better second, but I have to know what the second needs


1877
01:35:08.500 --> 01:35:10.300
in order to go back to the first and do that.


1878
01:35:16.300 --> 01:35:19.300
So Mercury won son to us son.


1879
01:35:19.300 --> 01:35:20.600
What's your problem? Yeah.


1880
01:35:21.500 --> 01:35:24.300
What what makes you happy and you have to know what planet we're


1881
01:35:24.300 --> 01:35:28.200
talking about. Right? So the sun is inner child creative expression


1882
01:35:27.200 --> 01:35:29.600
happiness vitality.


1883
01:35:31.600 --> 01:35:34.300
Personality ego so with your


1884
01:35:34.300 --> 01:35:37.300
Mercury it's like saying things to not conflict with your own ego when


1885
01:35:37.300 --> 01:35:40.200
it's in your own chart. So it's like how do you say things? How do I have


1886
01:35:40.200 --> 01:35:44.000
to say things so that my ego feels good. How do


1887
01:35:43.100 --> 01:35:46.300
I word things so that I don't feel like


1888
01:35:46.300 --> 01:35:50.300
I'm going against my own like my own


1889
01:35:50.300 --> 01:35:53.200
Pride I can still say things to be proud of what


1890
01:35:53.200 --> 01:35:57.500
I'm saying, but I'm I'm using in that scenario Mercury's


1891
01:35:56.500 --> 01:35:59.400
house placement everything about


1892
01:35:59.400 --> 01:36:03.300
Mercury. It's condition to strengthen the


1893
01:36:02.300 --> 01:36:03.300
Sun.


1894
01:36:06.400 --> 01:36:09.900
The first teacher of our time who is pure entertainment wouldn't


1895
01:36:09.900 --> 01:36:10.400
I call?


1896
01:36:11.400 --> 01:36:11.800
Thank you.


1897
01:36:13.800 --> 01:36:16.600
Why is the planet in the 12th house the


1898
01:36:16.600 --> 01:36:19.500
first planet? I'm not understanding the order in which


1899
01:36:19.500 --> 01:36:21.100
you read the planets, so.


1900
01:36:22.100 --> 01:36:25.500
It's in order of of these zodiac in


1901
01:36:25.500 --> 01:36:28.700
traveling so to get


1902
01:36:28.700 --> 01:36:31.100
from the to get to the first house.


1903
01:36:32.200 --> 01:36:35.700
I have to be at the 12th house to restart


1904
01:36:35.700 --> 01:36:36.200
the cycle.


1905
01:36:39.100 --> 01:36:42.200
I can I can see why you're you're looking at it the other way


1906
01:36:42.200 --> 01:36:45.100
because technically the first house will be first but it's it has to do with


1907
01:36:45.100 --> 01:36:48.700
the order of the angle. So we're


1908
01:36:48.700 --> 01:36:51.100
talking about a 30 degree angle. So we're talking about


1909
01:36:51.100 --> 01:36:54.400
these two planets here. And then you have to look at the ones that


1910
01:36:54.400 --> 01:36:56.800
are involved here, but we're looking at these two planets.


1911
01:36:58.200 --> 01:37:00.100
Which ones first of these two it's not.


1912
01:37:01.500 --> 01:37:04.700
We see it that Aries or


1913
01:37:04.700 --> 01:37:07.500
the first house is first and when


1914
01:37:07.500 --> 01:37:10.500
it comes to the seasons and the equinoxes and whatnot. Yes, it


1915
01:37:10.500 --> 01:37:14.100
is in how we read it. It's the baby Pisces is


1916
01:37:14.100 --> 01:37:16.200
the elder and it kind of goes around like that.


1917
01:37:17.400 --> 01:37:21.100
But when you're reading it in succession, it's kind


1918
01:37:20.100 --> 01:37:23.100
of like I don't I don't know if this is going to


1919
01:37:23.100 --> 01:37:25.500
stick but I'm gonna try this analogy.


1920
01:37:26.100 --> 01:37:29.100
If you are selling something you have your own business and you


1921
01:37:29.100 --> 01:37:32.400
have a dashboard when you go into the dashboard you have


1922
01:37:32.400 --> 01:37:35.600
some options to look at your analytics to see how much money you've made


1923
01:37:35.600 --> 01:37:38.400
so far. There's an option usually say from


1924
01:37:38.400 --> 01:37:41.200
the first of the month through now, let's say it's the 25th of


1925
01:37:41.200 --> 01:37:41.500
the month.


1926
01:37:42.200 --> 01:37:45.300
It's not but let's say it was if it's a 25th of


1927
01:37:45.300 --> 01:37:48.700
the month. You could say I want to know from the first of the month to the


1928
01:37:48.700 --> 01:37:51.500
25th of the same month and then you would have 25 days


1929
01:37:51.500 --> 01:37:54.700
using the first as the first point


1930
01:37:54.700 --> 01:37:58.800
and moving forward. But if you use the rolling


1931
01:37:58.800 --> 01:38:01.600
30 days, it goes back to the 25th of


1932
01:38:01.600 --> 01:38:04.900
the previous month meaning it crosses this first


1933
01:38:04.900 --> 01:38:07.600
house this first line barrier, right?


1934
01:38:07.600 --> 01:38:10.300
So for over here the 25th or whatever and we


1935
01:38:10.300 --> 01:38:13.700
Circle back around in the 25th of last month would


1936
01:38:13.700 --> 01:38:16.200
be sitting up here. If this were indicative of


1937
01:38:16.200 --> 01:38:19.600
of a Time map, right this came first


1938
01:38:19.600 --> 01:38:22.100
and then as we travel forward to get


1939
01:38:22.100 --> 01:38:25.300
to where we are so in I hope that's stuck. It's it's


1940
01:38:25.300 --> 01:38:28.900
all at the top of my head analogy, but when it


1941
01:38:28.900 --> 01:38:31.700
comes to the succession of the planets the easiest


1942
01:38:31.700 --> 01:38:34.400
way to look at it as I've got this I got the North Node


1943
01:38:34.400 --> 01:38:37.200
at 13. I've got the ascendant at 13. I'm dealing with


1944
01:38:37.200 --> 01:38:40.300
cancer and I'm dealing with Leo in the grand


1945
01:38:40.300 --> 01:38:41.900
scheme of everything. Which one comes


1946
01:38:42.100 --> 01:38:43.500
first cancer or Leo


1947
01:38:44.100 --> 01:38:47.200
cancer comes before Leo if you are talking about


1948
01:38:47.200 --> 01:38:48.500
Pisces and Aries.


1949
01:38:49.400 --> 01:38:50.900
When they are next to each other.


1950
01:38:52.400 --> 01:38:56.400
When they are next to each other which one comes first Pisces


1951
01:38:55.400 --> 01:38:58.700
because Aries can't


1952
01:38:58.700 --> 01:39:01.100
be first because Taurus is next. We will be skipping a bunch.


1953
01:39:01.100 --> 01:39:03.600
They have to be of the two we're talking about which ones first.


1954
01:39:04.500 --> 01:39:06.700
It's Pisces moves over. Okay, get it cool.


1955
01:39:07.600 --> 01:39:08.000
sweet


1956
01:39:10.100 --> 01:39:13.300
I would love to explore this semi-sex type with you my charts


1957
01:39:13.300 --> 01:39:14.700
some juncture or standard cool. Yeah.


1958
01:39:16.200 --> 01:39:19.600
So Melissa, so funny, I know that my Venus


1959
01:39:19.600 --> 01:39:19.900
issue.


1960
01:39:20.700 --> 01:39:23.700
I know what my Venus's issue. So I need to reconcile


1961
01:39:23.700 --> 01:39:24.200
it with Saturn.


1962
01:39:26.600 --> 01:39:27.100
There you go.


1963
01:39:28.200 --> 01:39:31.300
I'm glad that you got some clarity out of that that comment makes me


1964
01:39:31.300 --> 01:39:34.200
believe that this illuminated something for you.


1965
01:39:35.400 --> 01:39:38.900
Think of Seasons leaves fall first, yeah.


1966
01:39:40.400 --> 01:39:43.200
Yeah, whatever makes it easier for


1967
01:39:43.200 --> 01:39:44.700
you to remember. It's always in succession.


1968
01:39:46.500 --> 01:39:49.200
So yeah, it's a cause and they flow in


1969
01:39:49.200 --> 01:39:51.300
here you go. Again the energies flow in order.


1970
01:39:52.100 --> 01:39:55.300
So to resolve you must appease the first placement in order of


1971
01:39:55.300 --> 01:39:59.100
the zodiac and be creative to use it positively I should


1972
01:39:58.100 --> 01:40:02.000
have continued that sentence by appeasing what


1973
01:40:01.300 --> 01:40:03.300
the second needs.


1974
01:40:04.300 --> 01:40:07.200
When used positively the initials planet's wisdom can bring


1975
01:40:07.200 --> 01:40:10.600
strength to the planet's expression the SEC the next planet's expression


1976
01:40:10.600 --> 01:40:13.800
while maintaining their respective roles respective roles


1977
01:40:13.800 --> 01:40:16.400
is extremely important as well when we're used when


1978
01:40:16.400 --> 01:40:19.500
we're talking about the first planet in the second planet. The first planet is


1979
01:40:19.500 --> 01:40:23.400
not impacting the second planet's Jive like


1980
01:40:23.400 --> 01:40:26.800
all of its stuff here. It's still in its


1981
01:40:26.800 --> 01:40:29.600
house using its wisdom in its sign


1982
01:40:29.600 --> 01:40:32.600
to help support the other one. So if we're talking about Cancer and


1983
01:40:32.600 --> 01:40:35.600
Leo then the natural for my chart


1984
01:40:35.600 --> 01:40:35.800
here.


1985
01:40:36.900 --> 01:40:39.900
Then my North Node in cancer the 12th


1986
01:40:39.900 --> 01:40:44.300
house elements and the sign of Cancer everything


1987
01:40:43.300 --> 01:40:46.300
that it represents is now being


1988
01:40:46.300 --> 01:40:49.100
brought to help Leo, but I'm not


1989
01:40:49.100 --> 01:40:52.400
becoming a cancer. I'm still Leo. I'm


1990
01:40:52.400 --> 01:40:55.600
still me but I'm using this empathy. I'm


1991
01:40:55.600 --> 01:40:58.400
using the spirituality. I'm using behind the scenes. I'm


1992
01:40:58.400 --> 01:41:01.200
using transformation using all of this and my life purpose


1993
01:41:01.200 --> 01:41:03.700
to support what I can be.


1994
01:41:05.200 --> 01:41:08.600
Because I'm not just supposed to be my midheaven my


1995
01:41:08.600 --> 01:41:11.400
North notice connected to my ascendant how I present myself


1996
01:41:11.400 --> 01:41:14.800
in the world is linked to my purse my to my


1997
01:41:14.800 --> 01:41:18.000
North Node to my life purpose meaning I have


1998
01:41:17.500 --> 01:41:20.500
to use that or it becomes an irritation and


1999
01:41:20.500 --> 01:41:23.400
agitation. I will feel like I have no life purpose


2000
01:41:23.400 --> 01:41:26.500
because my ascendant is trying to do its own thing and


2001
01:41:26.500 --> 01:41:29.200
not listening to the wisdom of the one


2002
01:41:29.200 --> 01:41:29.700
before it.


2003
01:41:30.800 --> 01:41:33.300
And that's why this is so important which is why I


2004
01:41:33.300 --> 01:41:36.900
don't like when people when people us me, whatever are calling


2005
01:41:36.900 --> 01:41:38.000
it a minor aspect.


2006
01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:39.300
because


2007
01:41:40.400 --> 01:41:44.200
some of these minor aspects are very important


2008
01:41:43.200 --> 01:41:46.400
in your life because once you resolve them


2009
01:41:46.400 --> 01:41:49.500
you gain this like this next level of


2010
01:41:50.800 --> 01:41:54.600
of just knowing yourself and being able to unlock different


2011
01:41:53.600 --> 01:41:56.500
things which is what the energies are


2012
01:41:56.500 --> 01:41:57.000
supposed to do.


2013
01:42:00.200 --> 01:42:03.200
Semi-square I don't use this one as much I look at


2014
01:42:03.200 --> 01:42:03.400
it.


2015
01:42:04.700 --> 01:42:07.500
This is not included on this


2016
01:42:07.500 --> 01:42:10.800
little diagram here. I look at it. I


2017
01:42:10.800 --> 01:42:13.200
don't pay too much mind to it.


2018
01:42:13.200 --> 01:42:14.600
I have a semi-square here.


2019
01:42:15.800 --> 01:42:18.900
between in my chart between Saturn


2020
01:42:18.900 --> 01:42:19.500
and Uranus


2021
01:42:20.600 --> 01:42:24.100
has to do with my career and online there's agitation


2022
01:42:23.100 --> 01:42:26.600
trying to have authority on


2023
01:42:26.600 --> 01:42:29.400
because my Saturn's in the third house Authority through


2024
01:42:29.400 --> 01:42:33.700
my communication can be very agitating to my


2025
01:42:34.500 --> 01:42:37.200
My online presence So and I've seen that


2026
01:42:37.200 --> 01:42:40.400
play out is you know, I I have authority on a


2027
01:42:40.400 --> 01:42:43.500
lot of things. I know a lot of stuff but when I come across


2028
01:42:43.500 --> 01:42:46.900
as the guy who knows it then you know


2029
01:42:46.900 --> 01:42:49.700
with even with friends because Uranus rules


2030
01:42:49.700 --> 01:42:52.800
friendships, even with friends, they're like shut up like they


2031
01:42:52.800 --> 01:42:55.400
don't want to hear it and it's the same thing with online social


2032
01:42:55.400 --> 01:42:58.400
media people don't want to hear it and it's interesting


2033
01:42:58.400 --> 01:43:01.700
because you would think that it would just be Universal. It's


2034
01:43:01.700 --> 01:43:04.400
like, oh people don't want to hear when other people,


2035
01:43:04.400 --> 01:43:07.200
you know have the authority whatever but that's not true. It's


2036
01:43:07.200 --> 01:43:10.500
my energy. It's when I come across as I know


2037
01:43:10.500 --> 01:43:13.700
it I have to be very careful with


2038
01:43:13.700 --> 01:43:16.400
how I resolve these things. If I'm I have


2039
01:43:16.400 --> 01:43:19.500
to bring uniqueness into it. I have to bring education. I


2040
01:43:19.500 --> 01:43:23.100
have to bring my own experiences to justify everything


2041
01:43:22.100 --> 01:43:24.300
here also.


2042
01:43:25.300 --> 01:43:29.700
With the queen kunks which were about to talk about after semi-square with


2043
01:43:28.700 --> 01:43:31.500
my Venus. So it this whole


2044
01:43:31.500 --> 01:43:32.200
thing has been


2045
01:43:33.300 --> 01:43:34.700
a freaking Journey


2046
01:43:35.800 --> 01:43:38.400
and my Saturn return


2047
01:43:38.400 --> 01:43:40.800
had to do with a lot of this stuff and it was just


2048
01:43:42.300 --> 01:43:45.200
Man, it was something it's been something in my


2049
01:43:45.200 --> 01:43:48.300
life semi-squares that minor conflict.


2050
01:43:48.300 --> 01:43:51.400
It's it's less intense than the conflict of


2051
01:43:51.400 --> 01:43:54.400
a square a full-on square. It can create stubbornness within


2052
01:43:54.400 --> 01:43:57.200
the mixture of energies. So and that's


2053
01:43:57.200 --> 01:43:57.600
the thing is


2054
01:43:58.500 --> 01:44:01.500
I want to be able to express that but I have to know that there's


2055
01:44:01.500 --> 01:44:04.900
a semi-square there. I have to know that when I do that that people


2056
01:44:04.900 --> 01:44:07.400
are going to react negatively and I'm


2057
01:44:07.400 --> 01:44:10.300
going to get Kickback. I'm going to get people who


2058
01:44:10.300 --> 01:44:13.400
say nasty things and that's what ends up happening is. I


2059
01:44:13.400 --> 01:44:16.300
say I'm the authority I'm gonna tell you this is how it goes and I could be


2060
01:44:16.300 --> 01:44:20.100
a hundred percent right? I can even try to do a compassionately. If


2061
01:44:19.100 --> 01:44:22.900
I don't use the full on Sagittarius


2062
01:44:22.900 --> 01:44:25.200
energy. It just does not


2063
01:44:25.200 --> 01:44:28.400
play because I do have Neptune at my disposal with that energy


2064
01:44:28.400 --> 01:44:28.700
there.


2065
01:44:29.700 --> 01:44:33.000
But because it's in the same house as Uranus which


2066
01:44:32.100 --> 01:44:35.300
is part of that semi-square, but if I


2067
01:44:35.300 --> 01:44:38.200
don't use the urine is properly then it just


2068
01:44:38.200 --> 01:44:41.600
becomes this problem and it's agitating. It's literally


2069
01:44:41.600 --> 01:44:44.200
frustrating and that's what the word is. This is


2070
01:44:44.200 --> 01:44:47.900
the power word frustration and that's exactly how it feels the energies


2071
01:44:47.900 --> 01:44:51.500
are very frustrating to work with because often it


2072
01:44:51.500 --> 01:44:54.100
feels like it shouldn't play that way like it shouldn't


2073
01:44:54.100 --> 01:44:57.100
play I always feel in my chart and I know my wife


2074
01:44:57.100 --> 01:45:00.100
I'm pretty sure my wife had a few that we talked about and some other people's like


2075
01:45:00.100 --> 01:45:03.100
you shouldn't feel that if you have if you know how to


2076
01:45:03.100 --> 01:45:07.300
do something and you tell somebody you shouldn't feel kick back


2077
01:45:07.300 --> 01:45:10.300
on that. You shouldn't feel like people are agitated with you that


2078
01:45:10.300 --> 01:45:13.200
you're trying to push something on them. Like I'm not I'm not trying to tell


2079
01:45:13.200 --> 01:45:16.100
you anything. I'm just saying you ask the question. I answered it.


2080
01:45:16.100 --> 01:45:19.600
Well, who are you? Well, it just becomes the thing and you're just like why well,


2081
01:45:19.600 --> 01:45:22.800
I know why now, but when I was younger had no clue why


2082
01:45:22.800 --> 01:45:26.500
it would play out that way for me. It's this friggin semi-square


2083
01:45:25.500 --> 01:45:29.100
so it is frustration for sure


2084
01:45:28.100 --> 01:45:29.500
mine.


2085
01:45:29.700 --> 01:45:30.800
like 45 degrees


2086
01:45:33.300 --> 01:45:37.100
When it's actively utilized you can make severe progress


2087
01:45:36.100 --> 01:45:39.300
and alleviate the


2088
01:45:39.300 --> 01:45:42.300
agitation or the frustration that's going on and creates external


2089
01:45:42.300 --> 01:45:45.600
events as a result of the inability to naturally fuse


2090
01:45:45.600 --> 01:45:48.600
these energies together. Like I said, when these energies happen,


2091
01:45:48.600 --> 01:45:51.900
it creates other people to react


2092
01:45:51.900 --> 01:45:55.300
to me, that's the external event


2093
01:45:54.300 --> 01:45:57.100
that I'm talking about and if we


2094
01:45:57.100 --> 01:46:00.300
were to talk about all the things with career and changing jobs and


2095
01:46:00.300 --> 01:46:03.300
how that would you know, play in as well which I did all the


2096
01:46:03.300 --> 01:46:06.400
time. I changed my career constantly and that created


2097
01:46:06.400 --> 01:46:09.600
it an issue. Sorry, you can't see that and that created


2098
01:46:09.600 --> 01:46:13.200
this issue with having stability within


2099
01:46:12.200 --> 01:46:15.300
a job or having in your respect specifically with


2100
01:46:15.300 --> 01:46:18.300
my father. I had huge issues with my father


2101
01:46:18.300 --> 01:46:21.400
and I was I never understood why and I'm gonna talk about a queen


2102
01:46:21.400 --> 01:46:24.300
kunks in a minute because my Venus is Queen Kong's my


2103
01:46:24.300 --> 01:46:27.100
Saturn which is semi Square


2104
01:46:27.100 --> 01:46:30.200
my Uranus so when I kept changing jobs and I changed in the


2105
01:46:30.200 --> 01:46:32.500
different fields all the time. It was always something completely different.


2106
01:46:33.300 --> 01:46:36.400
My father would be like, I he I


2107
01:46:36.400 --> 01:46:39.400
remember one year when he was still doing my taxes when I was very young.


2108
01:46:39.400 --> 01:46:40.100
He's like


2109
01:46:41.200 --> 01:46:43.700
There are 14 W-2s.


2110
01:46:44.300 --> 01:46:46.200
There are 12 months in the year.


2111
01:46:47.100 --> 01:46:50.100
Why are you making me do this? And I was like Dad. I just wanted to


2112
01:46:50.100 --> 01:46:53.700
change jobs. I wasn't happy. I wanted to move and you


2113
01:46:53.700 --> 01:46:56.200
know, I didn't understand which is what a queen Kung


2114
01:46:56.200 --> 01:46:59.100
says. We'll get to that in a minute why this was such a problem.


2115
01:47:00.800 --> 01:47:03.200
and it had to do with the fact that I couldn't find a job that I


2116
01:47:03.200 --> 01:47:05.600
was comfortable with and I and ironically


2117
01:47:06.700 --> 01:47:09.400
the jobs I ended up staying at before I ended


2118
01:47:09.400 --> 01:47:12.700
up going solo independent, which is also Uranus


2119
01:47:12.700 --> 01:47:15.300
were in the technology field


2120
01:47:15.300 --> 01:47:18.800
cell phones Radio Shack AT&amp;T


2121
01:47:18.800 --> 01:47:21.400
Sprint and Verizon. Those are


2122
01:47:21.400 --> 01:47:24.500
the four jobs that I actually held on to for any significant


2123
01:47:24.500 --> 01:47:28.300
amount of time and that's resolving. I


2124
01:47:27.300 --> 01:47:31.500
didn't know at the time but that was resolving this


2125
01:47:30.500 --> 01:47:33.100
semi square and also at


2126
01:47:33.100 --> 01:47:34.800
the same time appeasing my son.


2127
01:47:36.300 --> 01:47:39.500
So it's interesting how it plays out before, you know astrology and


2128
01:47:39.500 --> 01:47:42.300
you kind of look back on things and then how you


2129
01:47:42.300 --> 01:47:43.500
can use that to move forward.


2130
01:47:45.600 --> 01:47:48.200
To do how can they and this is the point? How can


2131
01:47:48.200 --> 01:47:51.400
these two energies kind of act like a conjunction? That's


2132
01:47:51.400 --> 01:47:54.600
there are semi-square. They're not that far apart. They're


2133
01:47:54.600 --> 01:47:57.100
45 us a house and a


2134
01:47:57.100 --> 01:48:00.100
half. So to speak how do you make them work together? How do


2135
01:48:00.100 --> 01:48:02.300
you make both of those energies come together?


2136
01:48:03.100 --> 01:48:03.300
and


2137
01:48:04.600 --> 01:48:07.800
and work together. That's why I explained that Saturn and


2138
01:48:07.800 --> 01:48:10.300
Uranus for me is not about one over the


2139
01:48:10.300 --> 01:48:11.500
other. It's about both.


2140
01:48:12.700 --> 01:48:14.000
It's about being unique with it.


2141
01:48:15.400 --> 01:48:18.200
It's about you know, having the the


2142
01:48:18.200 --> 01:48:21.400
experiences and The Compassion or even being creative with


2143
01:48:21.400 --> 01:48:23.400
it is extremely important.


2144
01:48:24.700 --> 01:48:27.100
When applying so we didn't talk much about this


2145
01:48:27.100 --> 01:48:30.400
but applying and separating. Like I said, the faster Planet coming


2146
01:48:30.400 --> 01:48:33.200
up on the slower planet is applying and as it


2147
01:48:33.200 --> 01:48:36.600
passes and leaves it's separating when it's applying an


2148
01:48:36.600 --> 01:48:39.400
aspect is stronger when it is separating


2149
01:48:39.400 --> 01:48:42.600
an aspect is weaker, but also and I


2150
01:48:42.600 --> 01:48:46.200
want to use this example because I think it


2151
01:48:45.200 --> 01:48:47.900
is super duper important.


2152
01:48:49.100 --> 01:48:52.900
And I'm trying to remember the exact time.


2153
01:48:55.200 --> 01:48:58.200
I don't want to change that. I just want to do this and I think


2154
01:48:58.200 --> 01:49:01.200
it was December like 20th or something like


2155
01:49:01.200 --> 01:49:04.700
that of 2020. That was the great conjunction that is


2156
01:49:04.700 --> 01:49:05.700
going to help me explain.


2157
01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:07.300
something


2158
01:49:08.500 --> 01:49:11.900
Right here. Boom. So the great conjunction that


2159
01:49:11.900 --> 01:49:13.800
happened a lot of you guys.


2160
01:49:14.900 --> 01:49:17.300
Everybody taking this class should remember


2161
01:49:17.300 --> 01:49:20.600
this right? This was a huge huge thing going on


2162
01:49:20.600 --> 01:49:23.700
a couple of things of note


2163
01:49:23.700 --> 01:49:26.200
is that Pluto was within the orb of influence of


2164
01:49:26.200 --> 01:49:29.900
both of these planets. That is something that nobody discussed


2165
01:49:29.900 --> 01:49:31.200
not a single person.


2166
01:49:32.300 --> 01:49:35.700
Discussed this and I was all and I wasn't doing astrology like


2167
01:49:35.700 --> 01:49:38.100
live and in public at the time and I was always like


2168
01:49:38.100 --> 01:49:42.300
why is nobody talking about the fact it's not just Jupiter


2169
01:49:41.300 --> 01:49:44.700
and Saturn it has nothing to do with astrological


2170
01:49:44.700 --> 01:49:47.400
ages. By the way astrological ages are calculated by


2171
01:49:47.400 --> 01:49:50.600
the wobble of the earth using the North Node. I'm


2172
01:49:50.600 --> 01:49:53.400
sorry the North Pole direction towards


2173
01:49:53.400 --> 01:49:56.300
Which Constellation it's in so we are in the age of Pisces for


2174
01:49:56.300 --> 01:49:59.500
clarification if anyone had that question, but nobody was


2175
01:49:59.500 --> 01:50:02.200
sitting here talking about the fact that Pluto was involved in


2176
01:50:02.200 --> 01:50:04.600
this but even if Pluto wasn't involved,


2177
01:50:05.400 --> 01:50:08.800
The faster planet is Jupiter. The slower planet is Saturn


2178
01:50:08.800 --> 01:50:11.400
Saturn's restriction Jupiter is


2179
01:50:11.400 --> 01:50:15.300
expansion the planet in the lead always


2180
01:50:14.300 --> 01:50:16.300
takes control.


2181
01:50:17.300 --> 01:50:21.500
That's extremely important when you're talking about these energies


2182
01:50:20.500 --> 01:50:23.600
as they move forward and you're


2183
01:50:23.600 --> 01:50:26.800
talking about applying versus separating as


2184
01:50:26.800 --> 01:50:29.600
Jupiter was applying to Saturn. It


2185
01:50:29.600 --> 01:50:32.400
was much stronger than when Jupiter was


2186
01:50:32.400 --> 01:50:35.800
leaving because Jupiter was leaving the grasp of Saturn as


2187
01:50:35.800 --> 01:50:38.400
opposed to the energies coming full force


2188
01:50:38.400 --> 01:50:41.100
at each other. It's a car coming at you car


2189
01:50:41.100 --> 01:50:44.600
moving away at some point. They're still danger because they're


2190
01:50:44.600 --> 01:50:46.100
you know close enough for impact.


2191
01:50:47.500 --> 01:50:50.200
Once Jupiter, I don't know if you guys remember this but right around this time


2192
01:50:50.200 --> 01:50:53.400
leading up to this was terrible for


2193
01:50:53.400 --> 01:50:56.200
like everybody because everybody most people didn't know


2194
01:50:56.200 --> 01:50:59.800
how to utilize this energy but once Jupiter passed


2195
01:50:59.800 --> 01:51:02.700
Saturn things got easier, but


2196
01:51:02.700 --> 01:51:05.500
how can that possibly be when they're still conjunct? It's


2197
01:51:05.500 --> 01:51:08.900
because separating aspects which loosens


2198
01:51:08.900 --> 01:51:09.100
the


2199
01:51:10.500 --> 01:51:13.600
Amplified energy, but also


2200
01:51:13.600 --> 01:51:17.000
Jupiter took the lead so now Jupiter's energy


2201
01:51:16.400 --> 01:51:20.000
comes first and then Saturn's energy


2202
01:51:19.300 --> 01:51:22.500
to cling on to it which brought the Restriction


2203
01:51:22.500 --> 01:51:26.000
afterwards. So when you're reading these Transit, it's


2204
01:51:25.200 --> 01:51:28.600
extremely important to understand that the lead planet is


2205
01:51:28.600 --> 01:51:31.100
the one that's influencing the most when you're talking about


2206
01:51:31.100 --> 01:51:31.900
conjunctions,


2207
01:51:34.700 --> 01:51:38.200
So the semi-square can be internal like


2208
01:51:37.200 --> 01:51:40.300
frustrating other people but also


2209
01:51:40.300 --> 01:51:43.800
internal like having personal frustration. So it is it


2210
01:51:43.800 --> 01:51:46.000
is personal. So this is where the square


2211
01:51:46.700 --> 01:51:49.600
and the semi-square are very different.


2212
01:51:49.600 --> 01:51:52.600
The square is internal. It is you it's


2213
01:51:52.600 --> 01:51:55.200
within you you want to do this you want


2214
01:51:55.200 --> 01:51:58.600
to do this. They're fighting each other and you have to find a resolution so


2215
01:51:58.600 --> 01:52:01.600
that you can move forward the semi Square


2216
01:52:01.600 --> 01:52:04.300
creates that same frustration agitation, but


2217
01:52:04.300 --> 01:52:07.400
it's external it's outwardly presented. It's less


2218
01:52:07.400 --> 01:52:10.500
internal you don't notice it as much as other


2219
01:52:10.500 --> 01:52:12.900
people notice it within you. It's more of an external.


2220
01:52:15.300 --> 01:52:19.800
expression of that energy flow


2221
01:52:23.700 --> 01:52:26.600
and Uranus semi-square Neptune means


2222
01:52:26.600 --> 01:52:27.900
what so Uranus has to do.


2223
01:52:29.100 --> 01:52:32.600
Uranus has to do with friendships technology groups. The


2224
01:52:32.600 --> 01:52:35.900
future hopes dreams plans technology and that


2225
01:52:35.900 --> 01:52:39.000
is creating a frustration with Neptune which


2226
01:52:38.200 --> 01:52:40.400
has to do with illusion.


2227
01:52:43.700 --> 01:52:47.000
So this so that right there can mean that friend


2228
01:52:46.500 --> 01:52:49.400
depending on which one's first especially but friends can


2229
01:52:49.400 --> 01:52:52.300
think that you're ghosting them potential friends


2230
01:52:52.300 --> 01:52:55.400
can think that you're not being truthful about certain things. Even


2231
01:52:55.400 --> 01:52:59.000
when you are that could be really difficult. You could


2232
01:52:58.300 --> 01:53:02.500
be using Neptune for spirituality and your


2233
01:53:01.500 --> 01:53:04.700
independence of spirituality.


2234
01:53:06.400 --> 01:53:09.100
Sends a message to people in your


2235
01:53:09.100 --> 01:53:10.000
outward Circle.


2236
01:53:10.700 --> 01:53:13.600
Or anyone in your environment that you're some


2237
01:53:13.600 --> 01:53:14.000
sort of like.


2238
01:53:15.900 --> 01:53:18.700
Hippie or you know Rebel of


2239
01:53:18.700 --> 01:53:21.400
sorts, even if you're not really expressing it


2240
01:53:21.400 --> 01:53:25.200
like they get that vibe from you could also have to do with music could


2241
01:53:24.200 --> 01:53:27.200
also have to do with you know, you know, you


2242
01:53:27.200 --> 01:53:30.000
liking unique music can cause conflict with other people.


2243
01:53:32.200 --> 01:53:35.500
not me having my Mars and Taurus and my square midheaven and


2244
01:53:35.500 --> 01:53:36.100
Gemini, right so


2245
01:53:37.300 --> 01:53:40.400
Your Mars and Taurus your Mars and your mid Heaven


2246
01:53:40.400 --> 01:53:44.200
you have to realize that what you


2247
01:53:44.200 --> 01:53:47.200
want to do and what you're gonna take action and how you


2248
01:53:47.200 --> 01:53:50.200
take action is going to affect your career and that


2249
01:53:50.200 --> 01:53:53.200
other people are going to be affected in the


2250
01:53:53.200 --> 01:53:54.800
process of doing it.


2251
01:53:57.400 --> 01:54:00.300
especially with the communications that have that happen within


2252
01:54:03.700 --> 01:54:06.300
and people may think that you you don't budge and


2253
01:54:06.300 --> 01:54:07.200
that you're a little too.


2254
01:54:08.500 --> 01:54:09.100
demanding


2255
01:54:11.700 --> 01:54:15.500
Sun Aries seventh house semi-squares my


2256
01:54:15.500 --> 01:54:18.300
Aquarius. Okay. So the other way fifth house


2257
01:54:18.300 --> 01:54:21.500
Venus is my creative expression annoying. It's not it's


2258
01:54:21.500 --> 01:54:24.400
not always annoying. It depends on the planets that are involved but


2259
01:54:24.400 --> 01:54:28.000
it creates a frustration that creates outward situations. So


2260
01:54:27.400 --> 01:54:30.400
it's not that it's annoying all the time. The frustration


2261
01:54:30.400 --> 01:54:33.400
is you is is within you it's frustrating for


2262
01:54:33.400 --> 01:54:36.900
the person who has it not for everybody else. So your


2263
01:54:36.900 --> 01:54:38.200
son your creative expression and


2264
01:54:39.100 --> 01:54:42.700
and the uniqueness of the things you value in


2265
01:54:42.700 --> 01:54:45.500
your creative expression can make it


2266
01:54:45.500 --> 01:54:46.700
very difficult to


2267
01:54:48.800 --> 01:54:51.300
For other people to truly appreciate because you're


2268
01:54:51.300 --> 01:54:54.600
talking about Venus to other people to truly appreciate what


2269
01:54:54.600 --> 01:54:56.200
you're doing or to make money off of.


2270
01:54:57.200 --> 01:55:00.700
You know your work you would have to find a way to appease both of those so that


2271
01:55:00.700 --> 01:55:03.300
you can better make money better have


2272
01:55:03.300 --> 01:55:06.500
self your self-esteem. You would actually use your your


2273
01:55:06.500 --> 01:55:08.600
own personal values within your art.


2274
01:55:10.800 --> 01:55:11.200
to help


2275
01:55:12.100 --> 01:55:12.900
like manage that


2276
01:55:16.500 --> 01:55:18.200
assuming art is a part of that.


2277
01:55:18.900 --> 01:55:20.000
does personal


2278
01:55:21.200 --> 01:55:24.300
you can also feel like your children if you have children


2279
01:55:24.300 --> 01:55:25.900
that they are like


2280
01:55:28.300 --> 01:55:31.500
That they don't eat the things that you want them to eat because they're very


2281
01:55:31.500 --> 01:55:33.500
independent and quirky when it comes to food.


2282
01:55:34.600 --> 01:55:35.500
this personal or


2283
01:55:36.800 --> 01:55:39.200
outer plants make any difference how to deal with aspects or


2284
01:55:39.200 --> 01:55:42.500
it's not a factor that that's a really good question because a lot


2285
01:55:42.500 --> 01:55:46.000
of a lot of astrology sources


2286
01:55:45.100 --> 01:55:48.400
harp on the fact that outer planets don't


2287
01:55:48.400 --> 01:55:49.500
matter which is


2288
01:55:50.500 --> 01:55:54.200
So so far from the truth the inner


2289
01:55:53.200 --> 01:55:56.600
planets moved the most and therefore they


2290
01:55:56.600 --> 01:56:00.400
become more of your daily expression up to


2291
01:56:00.400 --> 01:56:03.700
Mars. So Sun Moon Mercury Venus and Mars. There


2292
01:56:03.700 --> 01:56:06.300
was five planets are your personal planets? They're the ones that


2293
01:56:06.300 --> 01:56:09.300
you interact with on a daily basis. They changed the


2294
01:56:09.300 --> 01:56:10.400
most they're most volatile.


2295
01:56:11.200 --> 01:56:12.900
I don't know follows the right word but most.


2296
01:56:16.700 --> 01:56:19.300
They're the most interactive. I'll just say it that way. The outer


2297
01:56:19.300 --> 01:56:21.800
plan is from Jupiter all the way to Pluto are.


2298
01:56:22.800 --> 01:56:25.300
Longer-term planets the further out


2299
01:56:25.300 --> 01:56:28.500
you go the longer term it is and the last


2300
01:56:28.500 --> 01:56:31.500
three Uranus Neptune and Pluto are


2301
01:56:31.500 --> 01:56:32.800
considered generational planets.


2302
01:56:33.800 --> 01:56:36.800
I don't know why they are so overlooked


2303
01:56:36.800 --> 01:56:39.800
the concept is that too many


2304
01:56:39.800 --> 01:56:42.500
people have the same planet in the same house,


2305
01:56:42.500 --> 01:56:45.300
but the degrees the aspects the


2306
01:56:45.300 --> 01:56:48.700
deckons all the transits all of that matters. So


2307
01:56:48.700 --> 01:56:51.500
to say that one doesn't matter over another


2308
01:56:51.500 --> 01:56:54.100
one you're gonna feel on a


2309
01:56:54.100 --> 01:56:58.700
more daily basis the other gonna feel longer term thematically, they're all


2310
01:56:58.700 --> 01:57:01.200
important. So when I look at aspects, I do


2311
01:57:01.200 --> 01:57:04.300
not I know we each one means that's really all that matters to


2312
01:57:04.300 --> 01:57:07.500
me. I don't treat outer planets differently than inner planets. I know


2313
01:57:07.500 --> 01:57:10.200
that the outer planets are slower and


2314
01:57:10.200 --> 01:57:13.900
more thematic. The inner planets are a bit more of


2315
01:57:13.900 --> 01:57:16.400
your your forward-facing demeanor.


2316
01:57:17.100 --> 01:57:19.000
But aside from that I treat them pretty much the same.


2317
01:57:19.600 --> 01:57:22.500
I'm a professional artist. It's hard to have my art valued because


2318
01:57:22.500 --> 01:57:25.300
the way I creatively express it. Have you been having issues with


2319
01:57:25.300 --> 01:57:26.400
selling it?


2320
01:57:27.900 --> 01:57:29.600
and it it would have to do with


2321
01:57:31.500 --> 01:57:34.300
You know Uranus Venus and Uranus is also one of those things that


2322
01:57:34.300 --> 01:57:37.400
like the frustration could be that you have to hold on to the art a


2323
01:57:37.400 --> 01:57:38.800
little bit longer and try to sell it later.


2324
01:57:39.500 --> 01:57:42.500
Because Venus and Aquarius can be some can be


2325
01:57:42.500 --> 01:57:44.300
someone who your art.


2326
01:57:44.900 --> 01:57:48.300
Has this future vibe to it that isn't


2327
01:57:47.300 --> 01:57:50.500
appreciated just yet and


2328
01:57:50.500 --> 01:57:51.300
it will be later.


2329
01:57:54.700 --> 01:57:57.300
But again, we have to look at all of the aspects because


2330
01:57:57.300 --> 01:58:00.300
there might be other things that are factoring in that play in


2331
01:58:00.300 --> 01:58:03.500
and change that even more but yeah, you would want to look to see why is


2332
01:58:03.500 --> 01:58:03.900
one.


2333
01:58:04.700 --> 01:58:07.300
Aspecting or aspecting and semi-squaring the


2334
01:58:07.300 --> 01:58:10.200
other one and how can you use one to fuel the other one? How


2335
01:58:10.200 --> 01:58:13.500
can you use the Venus and Aquarius to really express some


2336
01:58:13.500 --> 01:58:15.900
things you maybe you wouldn't before?


2337
01:58:19.300 --> 01:58:22.200
Yeah, and that's what it comes down to it's that on and


2338
01:58:22.200 --> 01:58:24.800
off again with Aquarius of whether or not you're able to.


2339
01:58:25.700 --> 01:58:28.800
Put value now, if you start doing art that's very


2340
01:58:28.800 --> 01:58:32.600
Aquarian related and Infuse your


2341
01:58:31.600 --> 01:58:34.500
what was the areas? I don't have


2342
01:58:34.500 --> 01:58:37.000
it up here. I think it was Aries you said and if you some of


2343
01:58:37.200 --> 01:58:40.300
that like more masculine tone to it, you'd probably be


2344
01:58:40.300 --> 01:58:43.600
able to sell more quicker and probably get


2345
01:58:43.600 --> 01:58:46.200
more value out of it as well. But like I said, we'd have


2346
01:58:46.200 --> 01:58:49.200
to look more into your chart or you'd have to analyze your chart


2347
01:58:49.200 --> 01:58:52.500
more to see how that that plays out because you need to appease that agitation


2348
01:58:52.500 --> 01:58:55.200
and that frustration and you can use it. Like


2349
01:58:55.200 --> 01:58:57.400
I said every single one even though it's frustration.


2350
01:58:58.400 --> 01:59:01.100
That frustration can be turned into something very positive.


2351
01:59:03.600 --> 01:59:06.500
And the queen conks mmm.


2352
01:59:07.400 --> 01:59:11.400
Poor old Queen Cox. So Queen kunk's is a 150


2353
01:59:10.400 --> 01:59:13.200
degree angle and a queen Kong.


2354
01:59:13.200 --> 01:59:16.500
If you have your first planet here in the second one five houses away. It's


2355
01:59:16.500 --> 01:59:19.500
the the house on either side of an opposition.


2356
01:59:19.500 --> 01:59:22.200
So it's very easy to find when you're looking


2357
01:59:22.200 --> 01:59:25.900
for it when you're looking at my chart. I


2358
01:59:25.900 --> 01:59:27.900
have boom boom.


2359
01:59:28.900 --> 01:59:31.400
I have Venus and it


2360
01:59:31.400 --> 01:59:34.600
is Queen Kong's my Saturn I have Chiron which


2361
01:59:34.600 --> 01:59:37.400
is Queen Kong's my Pluto Chiron as Queen Kong's my


2362
01:59:37.400 --> 01:59:39.900
Neptune. There's the main ones that I have.


2363
01:59:40.900 --> 01:59:43.600
So the the theme with a


2364
01:59:43.600 --> 01:59:47.100
queen konks is that it is a misunderstanding. It


2365
01:59:46.100 --> 01:59:49.600
is a compartmentalization because one energy


2366
01:59:49.600 --> 01:59:52.500
is so different from the other one that they literally does


2367
01:59:52.500 --> 01:59:55.600
not understand each other. So therefore when you do one


2368
01:59:55.600 --> 01:59:58.600
it feels like you're overcompensating for another


2369
01:59:58.600 --> 01:59:58.800
one.


2370
01:59:59.500 --> 02:00:00.700
It is a very difficult.


2371
02:00:03.100 --> 02:00:06.000
Set of energies to integrate when it is integrated.


2372
02:00:07.100 --> 02:00:10.500
It's amazing, but you still fully don't


2373
02:00:10.500 --> 02:00:13.200
understand it and it's so weird and I know that


2374
02:00:13.200 --> 02:00:16.500
because I'm using my Chiron in conjunctions or


2375
02:00:16.500 --> 02:00:19.800
queen Kong's the other word for a queen Kong is an inconjunction.


2376
02:00:20.600 --> 02:00:22.000
I'm using my Chiron.


2377
02:00:22.700 --> 02:00:25.600
With my Neptune with my Pluto. I'm literally doing


2378
02:00:25.600 --> 02:00:28.200
tarot in astrology to heal other


2379
02:00:28.200 --> 02:00:31.100
people. It does in my chirons in my tenth house. It


2380
02:00:31.100 --> 02:00:34.400
does not feel like it is supposed to I don't


2381
02:00:34.400 --> 02:00:38.000
feel like I'm actually healing anybody or helping anybody honestly.


2382
02:00:37.100 --> 02:00:40.200
I feel like I'm talking about a bunch of stuff. That's my


2383
02:00:40.200 --> 02:00:40.500
hobby.


2384
02:00:41.300 --> 02:00:42.500
And I've communicating it.


2385
02:00:44.400 --> 02:00:44.700
oops


2386
02:00:46.700 --> 02:00:49.300
So there's my hobby. There's my


2387
02:00:49.300 --> 02:00:52.800
communication and somehow it's my


2388
02:00:52.800 --> 02:00:55.300
career. There's value people are finding value


2389
02:00:55.300 --> 02:00:58.200
in it and I'm making money doing it and it doesn't


2390
02:00:58.200 --> 02:01:01.300
make any sense. It really doesn't make any sense to me.


2391
02:01:01.300 --> 02:01:04.200
And that's the thing with in conjunctions or queen


2392
02:01:04.200 --> 02:01:07.200
Kung says is that they don't make any sense. They don't feel like


2393
02:01:07.200 --> 02:01:10.500
they're supposed to be integrated. And usually they don't


2394
02:01:10.500 --> 02:01:13.700
the other one that I have which is very obvious is


2395
02:01:15.900 --> 02:01:18.300
You know Venus and Saturn and


2396
02:01:18.300 --> 02:01:21.100
that Venus rules Partnerships. It rules money.


2397
02:01:21.100 --> 02:01:23.900
It rules value. I've had a very difficult time.


2398
02:01:25.100 --> 02:01:27.300
Finding value in any career that I've ever had.


2399
02:01:28.100 --> 02:01:31.400
I've always been able to make money because Venus is in my 10th


2400
02:01:31.400 --> 02:01:34.400
house. But at the same time, I've also not


2401
02:01:34.400 --> 02:01:34.600
really.


2402
02:01:35.600 --> 02:01:38.900
Understood how to make money I


2403
02:01:38.900 --> 02:01:42.000
just do it. It's really weird. I know


2404
02:01:41.200 --> 02:01:44.600
how to make money but it's like I simultaneously somehow


2405
02:01:44.600 --> 02:01:48.300
don't really understand the systems of how everything's calculated


2406
02:01:47.300 --> 02:01:50.300
and it all at all


2407
02:01:50.300 --> 02:01:53.300
times and therefore to make


2408
02:01:53.300 --> 02:01:56.500
more money. I change how the system is used


2409
02:01:56.500 --> 02:01:59.300
to use a system in my own way because the


2410
02:01:59.300 --> 02:02:03.200
standard way of using a system never works for me. So in


2411
02:02:02.200 --> 02:02:05.000
order and I want my money, especially when I


2412
02:02:05.100 --> 02:02:08.900
was working commission jobs, so I would I would understand


2413
02:02:08.900 --> 02:02:09.700
the system.


2414
02:02:10.600 --> 02:02:13.400
And then understand how to make money from the system not


2415
02:02:13.400 --> 02:02:16.200
using it directly and that's my queen Cox because


2416
02:02:16.200 --> 02:02:19.000
to do it correctly. I don't know how anybody made any money.


2417
02:02:19.600 --> 02:02:22.100
And I would always make more money. That's the thing with


2418
02:02:22.100 --> 02:02:25.300
a queen conchs. It's an amazing energy and most people feel


2419
02:02:25.300 --> 02:02:28.200
like those energies can't work together. If you have a queen


2420
02:02:28.200 --> 02:02:31.200
kunks in your chart. Like I said, I have three which creates a yacht as


2421
02:02:31.200 --> 02:02:32.700
well in mind, which is an aspect pattern.


2422
02:02:33.600 --> 02:02:37.000
I'll do a class on aspect patterns, but once you


2423
02:02:36.400 --> 02:02:39.500
understand it once I understood that I


2424
02:02:39.500 --> 02:02:42.600
once I find Value in my career, once


2425
02:02:42.600 --> 02:02:45.900
I find Healing within astrology once


2426
02:02:45.900 --> 02:02:48.100
I find Healing within the occult and


2427
02:02:48.100 --> 02:02:51.500
communication and working one-on-one and then because of that sex tile


2428
02:02:51.500 --> 02:02:52.400
teaching it.


2429
02:02:53.400 --> 02:02:56.200
That's healing me. It's giving me a sense of


2430
02:02:56.200 --> 02:02:59.100
purpose which is also your tenth house and my mid


2431
02:02:59.100 --> 02:03:02.800
Heaven. Is there something that doesn't really make sense to me


2432
02:03:02.800 --> 02:03:05.400
because the energy seem to conflict my childhood


2433
02:03:05.400 --> 02:03:08.100
pain related to my father and never here's the


2434
02:03:08.100 --> 02:03:11.900
thing. Here's one way it plays out is my Chiron


2435
02:03:11.900 --> 02:03:15.100
Square my moon and my


2436
02:03:14.100 --> 02:03:15.400
Chiron


2437
02:03:17.500 --> 02:03:20.200
In conjunct or quaint hunks both


2438
02:03:20.200 --> 02:03:23.400
my Pluto in my Neptune is that I will never know my


2439
02:03:23.400 --> 02:03:26.500
father ever. I will never know his name. I


2440
02:03:26.500 --> 02:03:29.100
was lied to Neptune. I was lied to


2441
02:03:29.100 --> 02:03:30.100
by my birth mother.


2442
02:03:31.700 --> 02:03:32.600
sextile Moon


2443
02:03:33.400 --> 02:03:36.000
And also Square Moon, I was lied to


2444
02:03:36.200 --> 02:03:38.800
by my birth mother of who he was when I did my own research.


2445
02:03:39.800 --> 02:03:43.300
Here Jupiter coming in over Jupiter


2446
02:03:42.300 --> 02:03:45.400
on my IC Scorpio fourth house


2447
02:03:45.400 --> 02:03:49.600
wanted the secrets research deep research with


2448
02:03:48.600 --> 02:03:50.500
Pluto Libra.


2449
02:03:51.300 --> 02:03:54.400
And I found out all the legal information. I actually used


2450
02:03:54.400 --> 02:03:57.500
legal documents and court


2451
02:03:57.500 --> 02:04:00.800
documents to find everything else out I could but realizing


2452
02:04:00.800 --> 02:04:03.200
that these in conjunctions means I'm never going to know


2453
02:04:03.200 --> 02:04:06.400
who my father is and that was a deep deep wound


2454
02:04:06.400 --> 02:04:06.900
for me.


2455
02:04:07.900 --> 02:04:09.000
And it sucks.


2456
02:04:11.300 --> 02:04:14.100
I had to turn this around in the way that I


2457
02:04:14.100 --> 02:04:18.000
decided to turn it around is a I I make


2458
02:04:17.400 --> 02:04:20.200
sure my my children all know who I am


2459
02:04:20.200 --> 02:04:21.500
like who I really am.


2460
02:04:22.300 --> 02:04:25.200
And B, I also took solace in


2461
02:04:25.200 --> 02:04:26.500
the fact that my father doesn't.


2462
02:04:27.400 --> 02:04:30.400
Does not represent who I am I actually had


2463
02:04:30.400 --> 02:04:33.800
to take this self-worth in this value here and


2464
02:04:33.800 --> 02:04:36.900
to realize that my value and my self-worth cannot


2465
02:04:36.900 --> 02:04:39.300
be connected to my father because I'll never know who he is.


2466
02:04:39.300 --> 02:04:42.300
If it's who they think it could be he's dead.


2467
02:04:43.200 --> 02:04:45.300
But they don't even know it's him and they didn't know his name anyway.


2468
02:04:46.600 --> 02:04:47.800
So that's kind of.


2469
02:04:48.900 --> 02:04:51.400
That's how some of my queen kunks's have played


2470
02:04:51.400 --> 02:04:52.500
out quincx's to me.


2471
02:04:53.300 --> 02:04:56.700
No one talks about Queen Cox's. It's almost impossible


2472
02:04:56.700 --> 02:04:59.200
to find information. I've had to dig and dig and


2473
02:04:59.200 --> 02:05:02.200
dig and dig and like play around with it and like figure out like


2474
02:05:02.200 --> 02:05:05.500
how is it actually played and it took me a long time some aspects


2475
02:05:05.500 --> 02:05:08.200
of the queen Kong semi chart. I'm still like, okay. How does this really


2476
02:05:08.200 --> 02:05:11.200
fuse together? Because the energy doesn't understand each other.


2477
02:05:11.200 --> 02:05:14.600
So to try to understand how it can work together. It's like


2478
02:05:14.600 --> 02:05:15.800
this whole mind mess up.


2479
02:05:17.200 --> 02:05:20.400
But it creates a compartmentalization of energies. If


2480
02:05:20.400 --> 02:05:23.000
you focus on one area of Life, the other one has to


2481
02:05:23.500 --> 02:05:26.200
suffer or feels like it can't be involved. This is different from


2482
02:05:26.200 --> 02:05:29.500
an opposition because you're not you're not feeling out of balance.


2483
02:05:29.500 --> 02:05:33.000
You have two incompatible truths within you


2484
02:05:32.500 --> 02:05:35.400
when I do this, this is how I feel and


2485
02:05:35.400 --> 02:05:38.300
this is what I do when I do this blah, but they never work together


2486
02:05:38.300 --> 02:05:39.500
the key.


2487
02:05:40.400 --> 02:05:43.200
Is to make them work together because once you make them work


2488
02:05:43.200 --> 02:05:46.100
together you unlock new doors to all kinds


2489
02:05:46.100 --> 02:05:48.000
of things. You never thought were possible.


2490
02:05:49.300 --> 02:05:52.300
You can overcompensate in one area over another


2491
02:05:52.300 --> 02:05:55.900
another way that mine actually played out is having


2492
02:05:55.900 --> 02:05:59.000
value working with a partner. I always


2493
02:05:59.800 --> 02:06:03.400
I had a really hard time until Ashley realizing and


2494
02:06:03.400 --> 02:06:06.100
this is me playing with my queen kunks and realizing you know,


2495
02:06:06.100 --> 02:06:09.200
what when I rewind time every time I've had a


2496
02:06:09.200 --> 02:06:09.500
partner.


2497
02:06:11.400 --> 02:06:14.400
In my career it is done nothing, but benefit me.


2498
02:06:15.100 --> 02:06:18.300
And I have to have my partner as part of my career at all


2499
02:06:18.300 --> 02:06:21.800
times. Even the Logan Theory which is my other channel. My


2500
02:06:21.800 --> 02:06:24.600
wife is a part of that and she'll come from


2501
02:06:24.600 --> 02:06:27.700
time to time. It should be a part of that but that is


2502
02:06:28.800 --> 02:06:31.400
My wife brings the value into my career


2503
02:06:31.400 --> 02:06:35.200
and to my Public Image because it's in the 10th house when it's


2504
02:06:34.200 --> 02:06:37.400
just me. I have lots of issues with


2505
02:06:37.400 --> 02:06:41.000
this or when I try to what I used to do is my partner


2506
02:06:40.200 --> 02:06:41.600
would work with me.


2507
02:06:42.500 --> 02:06:45.800
But I would kind of be like I don't want you to really couldn't because there


2508
02:06:45.800 --> 02:06:49.000
were a bunch of other conflicts because I didn't value that it


2509
02:06:48.400 --> 02:06:52.700
created all these other issues and it


2510
02:06:52.700 --> 02:06:55.500
just became a mess. So now I I know


2511
02:06:55.500 --> 02:06:58.200
that my partner is integral to my own


2512
02:06:58.200 --> 02:07:01.300
success and that's because of this queen kunk's even


2513
02:07:01.300 --> 02:07:04.700
if I don't understand it because sometimes I feel like what I'm


2514
02:07:04.700 --> 02:07:07.200
doing and what she does don't really line up


2515
02:07:07.200 --> 02:07:10.500
but it's not about that. It's about the value that's brought


2516
02:07:10.500 --> 02:07:13.400
in especially with reputation healing Public Image all that within


2517
02:07:13.400 --> 02:07:16.100
my own chart. So it goes very deep quincx.


2518
02:07:17.400 --> 02:07:20.400
Ashley you are really impacting people such incredible


2519
02:07:20.400 --> 02:07:23.000
level. Oh, you're not just so appreciate. Thank you for


2520
02:07:23.100 --> 02:07:25.100
the value you bring thank you. I appreciate that.


2521
02:07:26.100 --> 02:07:29.800
I'm gonna cry Taylor. Wow, and


2522
02:07:29.800 --> 02:07:32.600
you were talking about Pluto and relation to past


2523
02:07:32.600 --> 02:07:35.700
relationships in a different way at the beginning class two amazing how


2524
02:07:35.700 --> 02:07:38.800
plus so many things? Yeah, Pluto Pluto is like


2525
02:07:38.800 --> 02:07:41.700
I said when I do people's readings Moon Chiron Pluto


2526
02:07:41.700 --> 02:07:44.700
understand those three things and you'll be unstoppable.


2527
02:07:46.200 --> 02:07:49.400
Are you saying a queen Kong says the same as an


2528
02:07:49.400 --> 02:07:51.200
in conjunction? Yes, I am Danny.


2529
02:07:52.100 --> 02:07:55.100
They are two words for the same thing. Sometimes you'll see


2530
02:07:55.100 --> 02:07:57.700
the word Queen Kong. Sometimes you'll see in conjunction.


2531
02:07:59.200 --> 02:08:01.000
So conjunction with an in front of it.


2532
02:08:02.100 --> 02:08:03.200
Surprised I didn't write it on here.


2533
02:08:04.600 --> 02:08:07.300
so it happens when you do this, like I make these materials and


2534
02:08:07.300 --> 02:08:07.700
like


2535
02:08:08.300 --> 02:08:11.200
30 30 to 45 minutes and then I just move on with life.


2536
02:08:13.800 --> 02:08:16.600
Let's see do do. Yeah. So


2537
02:08:16.600 --> 02:08:19.400
if you focus on one the other one feels left out common ground


2538
02:08:19.400 --> 02:08:22.700
is very difficult to obtain creates misunderstandings when


2539
02:08:22.700 --> 02:08:26.100
you're talking about synastry people. Look


2540
02:08:25.100 --> 02:08:28.700
at Queen Kong says they're in conjunctions in sinistry


2541
02:08:28.700 --> 02:08:31.400
as you can't make it work. When really it's you


2542
02:08:31.400 --> 02:08:34.400
just have to respect the other person and that they


2543
02:08:34.400 --> 02:08:37.300
are different from you and they are different than you and you can still be


2544
02:08:37.300 --> 02:08:40.300
a part of it. You don't have to understand it. You just kind of go with it and that


2545
02:08:40.300 --> 02:08:41.700
makes a relationship stronger.


2546
02:08:42.800 --> 02:08:45.400
Direct integration is not possible. And that's


2547
02:08:45.400 --> 02:08:48.200
important too. If you try to just fuse it


2548
02:08:48.200 --> 02:08:51.700
together normally and say okay. I have an in conjunction with this planet


2549
02:08:51.700 --> 02:08:54.900
in this planet just work together just work


2550
02:08:54.900 --> 02:08:57.400
together. It won't work. It it cannot


2551
02:08:57.400 --> 02:09:00.300
work. They don't understand each other. There's no common ground


2552
02:09:00.300 --> 02:09:03.200
and you'll see that in your life the way that it plays out


2553
02:09:03.200 --> 02:09:04.900
is something gets in the way.


2554
02:09:06.300 --> 02:09:10.200
This is where because they have nothing in common remedying this


2555
02:09:10.200 --> 02:09:13.700
requires Creative Solutions. And/or Blind Faith.


2556
02:09:13.700 --> 02:09:17.000
You have to intentionally creatively come


2557
02:09:16.200 --> 02:09:19.800
up with a solution that allows you to


2558
02:09:19.800 --> 02:09:22.500
integrate these two sets of energies and


2559
02:09:22.500 --> 02:09:25.200
pull them together so that they can work together and the


2560
02:09:25.200 --> 02:09:28.300
Blind Faith is just because you it doesn't make sense. I


2561
02:09:28.300 --> 02:09:31.600
can only tell you from personal experience that it just it doesn't


2562
02:09:31.600 --> 02:09:34.500
make sense, but it works. I know I'm using the energy


2563
02:09:34.500 --> 02:09:37.600
I'm knowing using this energy. This shouldn't work, but


2564
02:09:37.600 --> 02:09:38.100
it does


2565
02:09:39.300 --> 02:09:40.100
And that's how that works.


2566
02:09:41.800 --> 02:09:44.600
Mercury in conjunct Pluto the houses are very important. But


2567
02:09:44.600 --> 02:09:47.800
basically anything that's deep and transformative


2568
02:09:47.800 --> 02:09:50.500
in your life. You feel like you can't


2569
02:09:50.500 --> 02:09:53.300
discuss it like discussing or thinking


2570
02:09:53.300 --> 02:09:56.200
about things from the past, you know


2571
02:09:56.200 --> 02:09:59.500
the past days in the past and and I think what I think or things


2572
02:09:59.500 --> 02:10:02.500
that are transformational you feel


2573
02:10:02.500 --> 02:10:04.400
like you you can't utilize


2574
02:10:05.600 --> 02:10:08.200
That energy like the ability


2575
02:10:08.200 --> 02:10:11.900
to change and again, like I said, whatever's impacting


2576
02:10:11.900 --> 02:10:14.300
Mercury whatever is impacting Pluto in the houses that


2577
02:10:14.300 --> 02:10:17.300
it's in are extremely important, but it's this how you


2578
02:10:17.300 --> 02:10:20.900
think and how you communicate does not bode. Well


2579
02:10:20.900 --> 02:10:23.200
with like deep bonds I can also make


2580
02:10:23.200 --> 02:10:27.400
it very difficult for you to discuss anything intimate,


2581
02:10:26.400 --> 02:10:29.700
like actually have intimate like dirty


2582
02:10:29.700 --> 02:10:33.500
talk would be very difficult for a person with that thing because


2583
02:10:33.500 --> 02:10:35.200
it feels like you're not supposed to do that like


2584
02:10:35.800 --> 02:10:39.400
Pluto is Pluto sex is sex like intimacy


2585
02:10:38.400 --> 02:10:41.200
is intimacy and the way I think


2586
02:10:41.200 --> 02:10:44.300
and the things I say are what I think and say and there's no


2587
02:10:44.300 --> 02:10:45.900
integrating though. They're separate things.


2588
02:10:48.500 --> 02:10:51.300
Pluto Queen kunk's midheaven, I


2589
02:10:51.300 --> 02:10:54.200
see that as I don't see ways. I can transform through my


2590
02:10:54.200 --> 02:10:57.200
career. Yeah, that's one way it's very difficult to have a career


2591
02:10:57.200 --> 02:11:01.100
and also use plutonium themes.


2592
02:11:00.100 --> 02:11:03.100
So you may be chasing the


2593
02:11:03.100 --> 02:11:06.900
same type of career all the time, even though your career requires


2594
02:11:06.900 --> 02:11:09.600
you to utilize


2595
02:11:09.600 --> 02:11:12.200
Pluto's energy in whatever sign that it


2596
02:11:12.200 --> 02:11:15.100
is and whatever aspects are happening to that. So Pluto has


2597
02:11:15.100 --> 02:11:18.600
to do a transformation anything is deep down shared resources. Maybe you


2598
02:11:18.600 --> 02:11:21.600
feel like you can't borrow from other


2599
02:11:21.600 --> 02:11:24.700
people's work like your work has to be uniquely yours and


2600
02:11:24.700 --> 02:11:26.500
you can't take inspiration from other people.


2601
02:11:28.600 --> 02:11:32.000
Because you're maybe you're afraid of copywriter, whatever it again.


2602
02:11:31.200 --> 02:11:34.400
If it's in Pluto and Libra, it would be something legal


2603
02:11:34.400 --> 02:11:35.300
like copyright. But if it's


2604
02:11:36.100 --> 02:11:37.700
in another house, it would be for a different reason.


2605
02:11:39.200 --> 02:11:39.700
There you go.


2606
02:11:41.700 --> 02:11:44.200
Pluto third house. So yeah, it has to do with you know.


2607
02:11:47.400 --> 02:11:50.100
Yeah, that would be one reason that plays out actually.


2608
02:11:54.700 --> 02:11:55.600
and you also have to


2609
02:11:57.300 --> 02:11:59.900
you have to talk about the depth.


2610
02:12:00.800 --> 02:12:04.300
you have to discuss the depth in your


2611
02:12:04.300 --> 02:12:08.800
career, like your career requires you to communicate deep


2612
02:12:07.800 --> 02:12:10.600
feelings and Deep Emotions


2613
02:12:10.600 --> 02:12:14.100
and upheaval and chaos and allow the chaos to


2614
02:12:13.100 --> 02:12:15.600
be part of your


2615
02:12:18.500 --> 02:12:21.800
you know, the other thing is you feel like you can't sell like you


2616
02:12:21.800 --> 02:12:24.600
can't sell your your work for a


2617
02:12:24.600 --> 02:12:24.900
lot of money.


2618
02:12:25.900 --> 02:12:28.200
Which is not true at all.


2619
02:12:29.200 --> 02:12:32.200
Or you feel like you can't sell it and have a Public Image, which would be another


2620
02:12:32.200 --> 02:12:35.100
thing if you made Heavens in the tenth house your reputation.


2621
02:12:40.500 --> 02:12:43.400
Yeah feeling like you you have a hard time selling it yourself. Like you


2622
02:12:43.400 --> 02:12:46.500
have to sell it or you like you couldn't fuse these


2623
02:12:46.500 --> 02:12:49.500
two together have have a career that involves all


2624
02:12:49.500 --> 02:12:49.800
of that.


2625
02:12:54.500 --> 02:12:56.400
Jupiter fourth


2626
02:12:58.700 --> 02:13:00.600
Queen kung's Pluto in the 11th


2627
02:13:02.100 --> 02:13:05.400
This was that about when you ask if divorce.


2628
02:13:08.700 --> 02:13:11.500
Made sense. Well the signs and anything else in the


2629
02:13:11.500 --> 02:13:13.700
chart have I have to look at everything but


2630
02:13:14.600 --> 02:13:19.200
Jupiter has to do with luck teaching career anything


2631
02:13:20.200 --> 02:13:23.500
like your own opinions things like that, and then


2632
02:13:23.500 --> 02:13:26.700
Pluto in the 11th has to do with like deep bonds


2633
02:13:26.700 --> 02:13:28.100
with friends or


2634
02:13:30.700 --> 02:13:33.100
you know changing of technology and things like that.


2635
02:13:40.300 --> 02:13:41.800
fourth house Pisces, so it's


2636
02:13:44.400 --> 02:13:46.600
oh my goodness brains hurting.


2637
02:13:48.200 --> 02:13:49.300
I'm doing all this in my head guys.


2638
02:13:50.400 --> 02:13:51.600
So fourth house.


2639
02:13:52.200 --> 02:13:55.500
Jupiter in Pisces 11th house


2640
02:13:55.500 --> 02:13:58.400
Libra so Pluto in Libra in the 11th house. Yeah.


2641
02:13:58.400 --> 02:14:02.000
Yeah that makes it seem like the dissolution like


2642
02:14:01.200 --> 02:14:04.500
you have to keep going like the option of divorce.


2643
02:14:07.100 --> 02:14:11.600
Doesn't seem right for you because you with Pluto


2644
02:14:10.600 --> 02:14:13.300
and Libra that's sticking


2645
02:14:13.300 --> 02:14:13.700
it out. That's


2646
02:14:14.600 --> 02:14:16.800
that's deep bonds within your relationship.


2647
02:14:18.500 --> 02:14:19.300
also friendships


2648
02:14:20.400 --> 02:14:24.100
and then has to do with how you how you value your friends your


2649
02:14:23.100 --> 02:14:26.700
your friends or your partners friends versus


2650
02:14:26.700 --> 02:14:29.200
your home. Maybe you don't like to bring


2651
02:14:29.200 --> 02:14:29.700
them in.


2652
02:14:34.700 --> 02:14:37.100
Is third house related to


2653
02:14:37.100 --> 02:14:40.700
selling? Yes Mercury is sales. So the third house being naturally ruled


2654
02:14:40.700 --> 02:14:42.700
by Mercury or Gemini is sales as well.


2655
02:14:44.400 --> 02:14:44.700
Yep.


2656
02:14:47.100 --> 02:14:48.400
Okay.


2657
02:14:49.400 --> 02:14:52.300
So that's the queen konks. I'm not gonna talk much about


2658
02:14:52.300 --> 02:14:55.400
the quintile by quintile. I made you guys a slide so


2659
02:14:55.400 --> 02:14:58.400
that you could look into it. But this this is a good place


2660
02:14:58.400 --> 02:15:01.700
to find creative talents and hidden natural abilities.


2661
02:15:01.700 --> 02:15:04.300
They're hidden. You


2662
02:15:04.300 --> 02:15:07.200
don't realize you can do them until you do them. And then it's like oh,


2663
02:15:07.200 --> 02:15:10.700
yeah, I can do that. It's that kind of energy. There's 72


2664
02:15:10.700 --> 02:15:13.800
degrees and 144 apart and when


2665
02:15:13.800 --> 02:15:18.500
you talk about the guy quintile at 1:44,


2666
02:15:16.500 --> 02:15:19.600
I'm sorry.


2667
02:15:19.600 --> 02:15:20.900
You're talking about Quinta 144.


2668
02:15:25.300 --> 02:15:26.100
then your


2669
02:15:28.100 --> 02:15:28.700
where'd it go?


2670
02:15:31.200 --> 02:15:35.500
Have it then you're talking about a very slim


2671
02:15:35.500 --> 02:15:38.000
margin between one of


2672
02:15:38.300 --> 02:15:41.400
these angles versus the queen


2673
02:15:41.400 --> 02:15:44.300
kunks because the queen Kong is 150 degrees. And then when you


2674
02:15:44.300 --> 02:15:47.500
add in the orb of influence of about, you


2675
02:15:47.500 --> 02:15:50.100
know, three three degrees or so, you're going to


2676
02:15:50.100 --> 02:15:53.300
like 147. So 147 is like


2677
02:15:53.300 --> 02:15:55.600
make or break between these two angles.


2678
02:15:56.900 --> 02:15:59.000
I usually stay pretty close to one to two degrees


2679
02:15:59.400 --> 02:16:02.700
though. So it's not really a big deal the quintile when you


2680
02:16:02.700 --> 02:16:05.800
see the quintile it shows where you are creatively Innovative and


2681
02:16:05.800 --> 02:16:08.600
purposefully manifest things. This is intentional. This


2682
02:16:08.600 --> 02:16:12.000
is where you can create things that you want can show


2683
02:16:11.600 --> 02:16:14.900
compulsivity in behaviors when activated


2684
02:16:14.900 --> 02:16:17.200
this is something that when you do it you want it


2685
02:16:17.200 --> 02:16:19.100
it is yours and you kind of like


2686
02:16:20.300 --> 02:16:23.400
you you obsess a little bit in this Arena over


2687
02:16:23.400 --> 02:16:24.100
this Talent.


2688
02:16:25.600 --> 02:16:28.700
It can be expressed possibly or negative. It's usually overlooked but


2689
02:16:28.700 --> 02:16:31.800
it can give you drive passion and purpose. It's an external


2690
02:16:31.800 --> 02:16:33.500
expression. This is something that


2691
02:16:34.400 --> 02:16:37.300
You do outwardly you you using your career


2692
02:16:37.300 --> 02:16:39.400
you use outwardly use it when you're dealing with people.


2693
02:16:40.400 --> 02:16:43.500
And it it motivates you because it's a


2694
02:16:43.500 --> 02:16:46.400
talent that you can actually use a by quintile


2695
02:16:46.400 --> 02:16:49.600
shows you where you have access to creative and artistic talents. It's


2696
02:16:49.600 --> 02:16:52.800
less obvious. It's harder to to grab onto


2697
02:16:52.800 --> 02:16:54.500
and it works inwardly.


2698
02:16:55.400 --> 02:16:58.200
This is like I can do certain things as opposed to


2699
02:16:58.200 --> 02:17:01.500
I can like make certain things. It's I can do certain things. It


2700
02:17:01.500 --> 02:17:05.000
works inwardly. So it's really good for bringing Creative Solutions


2701
02:17:04.100 --> 02:17:07.600
to problematic issues. So it's like if


2702
02:17:07.600 --> 02:17:10.400
you have by quintiles in your


2703
02:17:10.400 --> 02:17:12.800
chart, let me see what I have. See if I have any


2704
02:17:15.200 --> 02:17:19.300
okay, so there's a good example here so by


2705
02:17:18.300 --> 02:17:20.000
quintile at


2706
02:17:21.200 --> 02:17:24.900
Forty I have those backwards by the way, the buy quintiles


2707
02:17:24.900 --> 02:17:27.200
the larger one, which is what was throwing me off


2708
02:17:27.200 --> 02:17:27.500
for a second.


2709
02:17:28.200 --> 02:17:29.100
I have to reverse that.


2710
02:17:30.300 --> 02:17:30.600
but the


2711
02:17:33.700 --> 02:17:36.200
where's the button the by quintile that


2712
02:17:36.200 --> 02:17:36.500
I have?


2713
02:17:37.400 --> 02:17:40.600
Here is between Mercury and Jupiter. So when


2714
02:17:40.600 --> 02:17:41.100
it comes to


2715
02:17:43.700 --> 02:17:46.300
Like online. I'm very good at this is


2716
02:17:46.300 --> 02:17:47.300
actually perfect example.


2717
02:17:47.900 --> 02:17:49.300
the whole reason


2718
02:17:50.400 --> 02:17:51.900
that I was able to create.


2719
02:17:53.200 --> 02:17:56.500
My own system in astrology you may


2720
02:17:56.500 --> 02:18:00.500
have heard me say this over and over is because I obsessed and


2721
02:18:00.500 --> 02:18:03.900
I dove deep through hundreds and hundreds of online resources.


2722
02:18:03.900 --> 02:18:05.300
That is because


2723
02:18:06.200 --> 02:18:09.900
my Mercury is by


2724
02:18:09.900 --> 02:18:11.200
quintile my Jupiter.


2725
02:18:12.200 --> 02:18:16.100
And Jupiter is on my IC. So something that I was passionate


2726
02:18:15.100 --> 02:18:18.700
about it is in Scorpio, which


2727
02:18:18.700 --> 02:18:21.600
has to do with diving deep Jupiter's very expansive. So


2728
02:18:21.600 --> 02:18:25.200
obsessive expansively obsessive and


2729
02:18:24.200 --> 02:18:27.700
then Mercury is in Gemini information


2730
02:18:27.700 --> 02:18:30.400
11th House online and then


2731
02:18:30.400 --> 02:18:34.200
the sun is just Vitality meaning I could just keep going going but


2732
02:18:33.200 --> 02:18:36.300
the by quintile is between Mercury and Jupiter.


2733
02:18:36.300 --> 02:18:39.200
This is why if you ever come I have


2734
02:18:39.200 --> 02:18:42.300
one two, three, four five. I usually


2735
02:18:42.300 --> 02:18:44.100
have five or six monitors around me.


2736
02:18:45.100 --> 02:18:48.400
and it's because I have all of this here and I know where everything is and


2737
02:18:48.400 --> 02:18:51.200
I just kind of scan through and then each monitor has pages and Pages


2738
02:18:51.200 --> 02:18:53.300
like different desktops and


2739
02:18:54.700 --> 02:18:57.100
All the time if I'm using Safari or chrome


2740
02:18:57.100 --> 02:19:00.500
doesn't matter. I have like 70 to 80 tabs open at


2741
02:19:00.500 --> 02:19:03.500
all times because I research I tab tab


2742
02:19:03.500 --> 02:19:06.400
tab. I research click look scan go here. And that's


2743
02:19:06.400 --> 02:19:09.700
that's a talent. It's not something I express outwardly.


2744
02:19:09.700 --> 02:19:12.500
It's something that I use inwardly. That's the by quintile


2745
02:19:12.500 --> 02:19:15.600
the bike quintile something that you use for yourself


2746
02:19:15.600 --> 02:19:19.000
as a talent to help you do things. That is


2747
02:19:18.200 --> 02:19:21.300
one for me. The bike went tile. I actually this is


2748
02:19:21.300 --> 02:19:24.100
the first time I've even looked at it but as soon as I saw it was like, oh, well, that's why


2749
02:19:24.100 --> 02:19:24.600
I do that.


2750
02:19:25.300 --> 02:19:26.600
the quintile


2751
02:19:27.400 --> 02:19:28.600
Is more outward?


2752
02:19:29.400 --> 02:19:33.000
And there it is. So Saturn here


2753
02:19:32.600 --> 02:19:36.000
for me is is quintile


2754
02:19:35.100 --> 02:19:38.600
and then I have Jupiter quintile myself node, which


2755
02:19:38.600 --> 02:19:41.200
is interesting. But Saturn is


2756
02:19:41.200 --> 02:19:45.300
quintile my Neptune so Saturn here


2757
02:19:45.300 --> 02:19:48.600
in the third house and then Neptune in the


2758
02:19:48.600 --> 02:19:51.700
fifth house. This is more outwardly on


2759
02:19:51.700 --> 02:19:52.600
how you can like.


2760
02:19:53.600 --> 02:19:56.600
Express things so when it came to like my career in


2761
02:19:56.600 --> 02:19:59.600
music, I was obsessive over that


2762
02:19:59.600 --> 02:20:02.700
that was the compulsion. It wasn't Obsession as much as compulsion


2763
02:20:02.700 --> 02:20:05.800
like wanting to constantly do it and when


2764
02:20:05.800 --> 02:20:09.000
I was in that and when I was in film as well, that's


2765
02:20:08.200 --> 02:20:11.600
all that was. My whole life was film film


2766
02:20:11.600 --> 02:20:14.200
film film film film film and just constantly coming up


2767
02:20:14.200 --> 02:20:18.000
freaking Jupiter energy with this Sagittarius energy


2768
02:20:17.700 --> 02:20:20.300
just constantly coming up with new stuff.


2769
02:20:21.200 --> 02:20:24.400
So but that was outwardly that was creative expression. I


2770
02:20:24.400 --> 02:20:27.200
was creating film. I was creating music. I was


2771
02:20:27.200 --> 02:20:30.300
doing that there and there's a bunch of other ways. This can


2772
02:20:30.300 --> 02:20:33.300
also play out with my long-term like long-term like


2773
02:20:33.300 --> 02:20:35.000
Authority Communications here.


2774
02:20:35.900 --> 02:20:37.400
With Neptune. It's like


2775
02:20:38.100 --> 02:20:39.100
I tried to take


2776
02:20:40.400 --> 02:20:43.100
I never liked to be the authority when I


2777
02:20:43.100 --> 02:20:46.700
spoke in terms of when I was on film sets. I always


2778
02:20:46.700 --> 02:20:49.500
wanted to kind of like guide people and I


2779
02:20:49.500 --> 02:20:52.400
wanted to hand off authority to


2780
02:20:52.400 --> 02:20:55.000
other people which is also how this energy played.


2781
02:20:57.900 --> 02:21:00.200
ninth house Libra Sun


2782
02:21:02.500 --> 02:21:06.100
Quintile my 11th house Sagittarius Jupiter and


2783
02:21:05.100 --> 02:21:08.800
it is a power to harness. Oh, absolutely


2784
02:21:08.800 --> 02:21:11.400
and if it's a quintile then it


2785
02:21:11.400 --> 02:21:14.800
is again. It's external. It's it's creative or


2786
02:21:14.800 --> 02:21:17.200
artistic talents. That's why


2787
02:21:17.200 --> 02:21:20.200
I was a good filmmaker is because of that. I was


2788
02:21:20.200 --> 02:21:23.100
good at making music was because of that Saturn especially when


2789
02:21:23.100 --> 02:21:26.200
I sat there and I like really put everything into it and I


2790
02:21:26.200 --> 02:21:29.100
was the one the boss. I was the guy in the films in the


2791
02:21:29.100 --> 02:21:32.300
music studio mixing everything writing everything


2792
02:21:32.300 --> 02:21:35.700
doing everything when I was filmmaking. I was the producer I


2793
02:21:35.700 --> 02:21:38.400
was the director. I was this fight choreographer. I did everything


2794
02:21:38.400 --> 02:21:41.300
and then I hired other people into take over


2795
02:21:41.300 --> 02:21:44.200
certain roles that either I didn't want to do or felt could be


2796
02:21:44.200 --> 02:21:47.200
better in someone else's hands for you. It comes to


2797
02:21:47.200 --> 02:21:50.200
Libra which is working with other people, especially with opinions and


2798
02:21:52.100 --> 02:21:55.800
or I could be travel or it could be higher education could be


2799
02:21:55.800 --> 02:21:58.200
culture and then you have a quintile with your


2800
02:21:58.200 --> 02:22:01.300
11th house which is hopes and dreams technology so you


2801
02:22:01.300 --> 02:22:01.400
can


2802
02:22:02.400 --> 02:22:05.400
Libra so you can really take


2803
02:22:08.400 --> 02:22:10.300
this would be really good for like web design actually.


2804
02:22:11.800 --> 02:22:14.400
Web design working with International people or


2805
02:22:14.400 --> 02:22:17.400
doing something that's expanding like building out


2806
02:22:17.400 --> 02:22:20.100
websites. You would be really well. And obviously I have to


2807
02:22:20.100 --> 02:22:24.000
see the rest of it. But that kind of energy would would


2808
02:22:23.300 --> 02:22:25.300
allow you to do those kinds of things.


2809
02:22:33.300 --> 02:22:36.200
Also pulling together people's opinions in teams would be


2810
02:22:36.200 --> 02:22:39.600
a strength that you would be able to do outwardly as well being able


2811
02:22:39.600 --> 02:22:42.900
to take people's ideas and their opinions and


2812
02:22:42.900 --> 02:22:45.400
kind of fuse those together to be


2813
02:22:45.400 --> 02:22:47.100
able to move forward with everything.


2814
02:22:49.800 --> 02:22:52.300
Okay, so that's that. Like I


2815
02:22:52.300 --> 02:22:55.200
said transits are the next part. Those were the


2816
02:22:55.200 --> 02:22:59.400
aspects each. One of those is a single aspect aspects


2817
02:22:58.400 --> 02:23:01.200
can be linked together in multiple ways. We


2818
02:23:01.200 --> 02:23:04.700
will obviously be doing that. You're welcome. We'll


2819
02:23:04.700 --> 02:23:07.500
obviously be doing that in another class because it's already


2820
02:23:07.500 --> 02:23:10.600
been over two and a half hours. So we're gonna jump into transits and


2821
02:23:10.600 --> 02:23:13.200
then more Q&amp;A and that'll be it. So


2822
02:23:13.200 --> 02:23:17.200
again, I'm not going to talk too much about transits because


2823
02:23:16.200 --> 02:23:19.700
I'll have to do an entire class on transits, you


2824
02:23:19.700 --> 02:23:23.100
know to kind of really dive into them. But transit's in


2825
02:23:23.100 --> 02:23:26.500
astrology have to do with when we pull up this chart


2826
02:23:26.500 --> 02:23:29.200
in in astro.com. And I


2827
02:23:29.200 --> 02:23:32.400
activate the transits on the chart. You


2828
02:23:32.400 --> 02:23:35.200
see these green glyphs that are on the outside. They are the


2829
02:23:35.200 --> 02:23:36.000
current positioning.


2830
02:23:36.900 --> 02:23:39.400
Of the planets in outer space


2831
02:23:39.400 --> 02:23:42.600
as we see them from the perspective of Earth. It has


2832
02:23:42.600 --> 02:23:47.000
nothing to do with astronomy because we study Western astrology.


2833
02:23:45.800 --> 02:23:48.100
It is not


2834
02:23:48.100 --> 02:23:51.100
sidereal. It is tropical. It does not factor in


2835
02:23:51.100 --> 02:23:54.700
the procession of the equinoxes, which is the Earth's basically


2836
02:23:54.700 --> 02:23:57.700
floating off of its off of the the ecliptic.


2837
02:23:59.600 --> 02:24:01.900
or the Earth's relationship with the ecliptic we


2838
02:24:02.800 --> 02:24:05.300
Determine the planets based off of


2839
02:24:05.300 --> 02:24:08.600
the point of view based off of the vernal equinox.


2840
02:24:11.200 --> 02:24:14.500
Take a drink of water channeling Mama Earth. I should


2841
02:24:14.500 --> 02:24:17.200
where did my water go. It's over here. I will take


2842
02:24:17.200 --> 02:24:19.000
a quick sip of water.


2843
02:24:23.600 --> 02:24:25.100
No product placement until they pay me.


2844
02:24:26.400 --> 02:24:27.100
Just kidding.


2845
02:24:27.700 --> 02:24:28.700
We need to do our own water.


2846
02:24:32.900 --> 02:24:34.200
which we're actually talking about doing but


2847
02:24:35.500 --> 02:24:39.000
let's see. Okay, so that


2848
02:24:40.100 --> 02:24:43.100
Okay, so these green this is where all the the planets are


2849
02:24:43.100 --> 02:24:46.800
transits are the energy of those planets not


2850
02:24:46.800 --> 02:24:49.300
inside our body not impacting us on


2851
02:24:49.300 --> 02:24:52.600
a daily on a personality basis. But how


2852
02:24:52.600 --> 02:24:53.000
are they?


2853
02:24:53.700 --> 02:24:56.600
impacting us outwardly inwardly


2854
02:24:57.400 --> 02:25:00.500
There's a better way to say that how are they pressuring us? Basically,


2855
02:25:00.500 --> 02:25:03.600
how is the external Force impacting us and


2856
02:25:03.600 --> 02:25:05.300
coming in on our lives?


2857
02:25:07.200 --> 02:25:10.300
Your natal charts and imprint of the energies of the exact moment


2858
02:25:10.300 --> 02:25:13.200
in location of your birth the planets continue to move.


2859
02:25:13.200 --> 02:25:16.700
Right? So your natal chart is in print of the energies


2860
02:25:16.700 --> 02:25:19.300
when you were born transits are where they are now


2861
02:25:19.300 --> 02:25:22.600
transits are the position the planets when you're


2862
02:25:22.600 --> 02:25:25.300
doing predictive astrology, you can use an ephemeris or


2863
02:25:25.300 --> 02:25:29.300
software every software like astro.com use


2864
02:25:28.300 --> 02:25:31.500
this in ephemeris to power it. Basically, it


2865
02:25:31.500 --> 02:25:34.300
knows the exact mathematical degree of every single


2866
02:25:34.300 --> 02:25:36.700
planet at any time past present future.


2867
02:25:37.800 --> 02:25:40.800
You can determine where they are. Now. You


2868
02:25:40.800 --> 02:25:43.200
can determine where they were in the past or you can


2869
02:25:43.200 --> 02:25:46.900
determine where they will be in the future predictive astrology is I


2870
02:25:46.900 --> 02:25:49.400
look to see where planets are now and I look to


2871
02:25:49.400 --> 02:25:52.200
see where they are next month when a major transit or


2872
02:25:52.200 --> 02:25:55.200
major event is happening or at any date in the future. If you


2873
02:25:55.200 --> 02:25:58.300
know, you're doing something a specific day. You want to know what that energy is


2874
02:25:58.300 --> 02:26:01.600
gonna be like we can always look at that and then see where


2875
02:26:01.600 --> 02:26:05.500
each planet is what area of life it's impacting and if


2876
02:26:04.500 --> 02:26:07.400
it's making aspects with


2877
02:26:07.400 --> 02:26:08.200
each other.


2878
02:26:09.800 --> 02:26:11.300
And/or with you.


2879
02:26:12.200 --> 02:26:15.300
So when you're looking at aspects, it's


2880
02:26:15.300 --> 02:26:18.900
not just your own aspects. That's one level that's understanding


2881
02:26:18.900 --> 02:26:21.200
yourself, but when you look at


2882
02:26:24.300 --> 02:26:25.200
where to go


2883
02:26:26.500 --> 02:26:29.400
when you look at the current planets, which these are


2884
02:26:29.400 --> 02:26:32.300
the ones for right now all of these now you


2885
02:26:32.300 --> 02:26:35.300
can draft this as a chart of the moment


2886
02:26:35.300 --> 02:26:38.800
which pops up just like this and then


2887
02:26:38.800 --> 02:26:41.200
we can look at it just the same as a natal chart.


2888
02:26:41.200 --> 02:26:44.200
So basically this is just the impact of the energies there


2889
02:26:44.200 --> 02:26:48.200
and I can go down here and I can see all of the planets that


2890
02:26:48.200 --> 02:26:51.700
are impacting each other. These are the aspects within the


2891
02:26:51.700 --> 02:26:54.500
transits, but this is just within each


2892
02:26:54.500 --> 02:26:57.400
other. I would want to know this information to know how each


2893
02:26:57.400 --> 02:27:01.100
planet out and outer space is if


2894
02:27:00.100 --> 02:27:04.100
it has a relationship with another planet once it


2895
02:27:03.100 --> 02:27:06.500
affects me and it affects you


2896
02:27:06.500 --> 02:27:08.200
in a Transit.


2897
02:27:09.800 --> 02:27:12.600
When it comes in like I discussed earlier


2898
02:27:12.600 --> 02:27:15.300
with Saturn over my moon. This is a conjunction. The


2899
02:27:15.300 --> 02:27:18.300
Moon is actually conjunct Vesta and my moon as


2900
02:27:18.300 --> 02:27:21.600
well and then thus forming


2901
02:27:21.600 --> 02:27:25.000
its own conjunction. So in aspects, this


2902
02:27:24.100 --> 02:27:28.000
is a conjunction this is a conjunction and


2903
02:27:27.100 --> 02:27:30.200
then this is a conjunction so we have and then


2904
02:27:30.200 --> 02:27:34.100
this is another conjunction. So really have four conjunctions


2905
02:27:33.100 --> 02:27:37.300
that we're looking at at least here Saturn


2906
02:27:36.300 --> 02:27:39.200
in the Sun. The transits are forming a


2907
02:27:39.200 --> 02:27:42.500
conjunction in my natal chart my moon in Vesta are


2908
02:27:42.500 --> 02:27:45.600
forming a conjunction and then the transit impact


2909
02:27:45.600 --> 02:27:49.000
to me. My transits are forming in


2910
02:27:48.100 --> 02:27:51.400
a conjunction to my natal and the way you read


2911
02:27:51.400 --> 02:27:55.500
this is Saturn is conjunct Transit.


2912
02:27:54.500 --> 02:27:57.400
Saturn is conjunct Transit Sun.


2913
02:27:58.200 --> 02:28:01.900
And that is conjunct my natal Moon and


2914
02:28:01.900 --> 02:28:04.300
natal Vesta. That's how


2915
02:28:04.300 --> 02:28:04.900
you would read that.


2916
02:28:06.300 --> 02:28:09.700
You can read it. However you want but that's the easiest way transit to


2917
02:28:09.700 --> 02:28:10.100
natal.


2918
02:28:11.100 --> 02:28:14.100
So this is highlighting my career.


2919
02:28:14.100 --> 02:28:17.400
This is highlighting. You know enjoying my careers is highlighting figuring


2920
02:28:17.400 --> 02:28:20.100
out honestly, this is figuring out what I want to do, which is interesting


2921
02:28:20.100 --> 02:28:23.600
because the last few days specifically yesterday and


2922
02:28:23.600 --> 02:28:26.700
today have been a lot about my own independence and


2923
02:28:26.700 --> 02:28:30.400
doing something on my own. I don't know if you guys caught and


2924
02:28:29.400 --> 02:28:32.300
if you're watching this in like four


2925
02:28:32.300 --> 02:28:36.000
years from now, this won't make any sense, but I don't know if you caught I think


2926
02:28:35.100 --> 02:28:38.600
it was yesterday. I did it actually did


2927
02:28:38.600 --> 02:28:41.100
a terror reading for me live. She had no idea


2928
02:28:41.100 --> 02:28:44.600
was gonna be asking that specific question. I just told her to have her cards already and it


2929
02:28:44.600 --> 02:28:47.100
was whether or not I should go off and create my own


2930
02:28:47.100 --> 02:28:50.700
brand and kind of do my own things separate of Mystic Rebels separate of


2931
02:28:50.700 --> 02:28:53.200
all the other businesses that we have together so that I have some


2932
02:28:53.200 --> 02:28:56.100
Independence and it's because of this it's because I


2933
02:28:56.100 --> 02:28:59.300
need something that's mine. I need something that's going to light up. My fire


2934
02:28:59.300 --> 02:29:02.400
in the sun is creative expression. The sun


2935
02:29:02.400 --> 02:29:05.300
is talking about what's gonna make you happy. Where's that gonna


2936
02:29:05.300 --> 02:29:08.500
be? This is why I Transit class has to be done separately because each


2937
02:29:08.500 --> 02:29:10.300
planet has its own.


2938
02:29:11.200 --> 02:29:14.200
These but when it's impacting you it's outward Force coming


2939
02:29:14.200 --> 02:29:17.300
inward. So it's not just like career and whatnot.


2940
02:29:17.300 --> 02:29:20.400
It's also what type of responsibilities are being pushed on you.


2941
02:29:20.400 --> 02:29:22.400
What type of long-term goals are being pushed on you.


2942
02:29:23.200 --> 02:29:26.200
And that influence that's coming over to you


2943
02:29:26.200 --> 02:29:27.900
and for me, it's emotional.


2944
02:29:29.200 --> 02:29:32.300
And then you can read it outward as well is what are


2945
02:29:32.300 --> 02:29:35.600
the things that are long-term that are going to make me feel emotionally


2946
02:29:35.600 --> 02:29:38.700
content, but also where am I gonna find my happiness? That's


2947
02:29:38.700 --> 02:29:41.300
also going to Light My Fire. How can I use this


2948
02:29:41.300 --> 02:29:44.200
energy to spark a fire? And that's the


2949
02:29:44.200 --> 02:29:48.200
focus transits become a focus the aspects


2950
02:29:47.200 --> 02:29:50.600
that transits form become a


2951
02:29:50.600 --> 02:29:53.100
focus and that's what's important you use that


2952
02:29:53.100 --> 02:29:56.700
energy because it's impacting and it's creating


2953
02:29:56.700 --> 02:29:59.700
this opportunity for you and it


2954
02:29:59.700 --> 02:30:01.500
can be an agitation. It can be a struggle.


2955
02:30:02.300 --> 02:30:05.200
The biggest struggle with transits to be completely honest like a


2956
02:30:05.200 --> 02:30:08.400
Saturn return for instance. Right? Saturn return is a Transit. It's


2957
02:30:08.400 --> 02:30:10.800
one of the most popular transits next to a solar return.


2958
02:30:11.600 --> 02:30:14.100
And it just says that Saturn has made its way all the


2959
02:30:14.100 --> 02:30:17.600
way through the Zodiac and it's coming back on your natal position and the


2960
02:30:17.600 --> 02:30:21.000
energy of discipline and responsibility is impacting


2961
02:30:20.200 --> 02:30:23.800
your internal discipline and responsibility


2962
02:30:23.800 --> 02:30:27.000
and it's forcing you to find alignment


2963
02:30:26.500 --> 02:30:29.800
between these two things. That's a


2964
02:30:29.800 --> 02:30:33.100
Saturn return in its most basic form and obviously


2965
02:30:32.100 --> 02:30:35.800
all the other transits and everything else is impacting


2966
02:30:35.800 --> 02:30:38.800
at the same time, which creates all the events scenarios


2967
02:30:38.800 --> 02:30:41.200
and situations, but it's telling you what area of


2968
02:30:41.200 --> 02:30:44.500
life and what you're supposed to be doing and we as human


2969
02:30:44.500 --> 02:30:46.400
beings are stubborn.


2970
02:30:47.200 --> 02:30:50.500
We always think because the sun's the biggest planet that our


2971
02:30:50.500 --> 02:30:53.200
ego is more important that we know what's best for


2972
02:30:53.200 --> 02:30:56.100
us at all times. We know that we want to do what we


2973
02:30:56.100 --> 02:31:00.100
want to do and Saturn comes along and says, I'm I'm


2974
02:30:59.100 --> 02:31:02.700
coming in on your third largest planet and


2975
02:31:02.700 --> 02:31:05.300
I'm you know as the third largest planet and I'm


2976
02:31:05.300 --> 02:31:08.200
saying no you need to figure out your life and you


2977
02:31:08.200 --> 02:31:11.200
need to do things that are going to be good for you in the long term and then


2978
02:31:11.200 --> 02:31:14.600
you can go ahead and factor in your son while you're


2979
02:31:14.600 --> 02:31:17.000
doing it. But the problem is we ignore Saturn and


2980
02:31:17.100 --> 02:31:20.100
we we it's like the authority that we're just like no, I don't


2981
02:31:20.100 --> 02:31:24.000
care what you have to say. And then Saturn is a freaking massive


2982
02:31:23.400 --> 02:31:26.100
giant planet and we think that


2983
02:31:26.100 --> 02:31:29.400
we somehow have power over it and we don't we can


2984
02:31:29.400 --> 02:31:32.200
work with it or we can try and work against it and have our lives


2985
02:31:32.200 --> 02:31:32.900
be ruined.


2986
02:31:33.700 --> 02:31:36.100
So that's why transits are so very important to understand


2987
02:31:36.100 --> 02:31:36.600
what's happening.


2988
02:31:38.500 --> 02:31:40.600
and Transit Sun Saturn exec


2989
02:31:41.100 --> 02:31:44.400
conjunction with my ascendant Chiron. So this is all about healing


2990
02:31:44.400 --> 02:31:47.300
for you. This is all about stepping into your


2991
02:31:47.300 --> 02:31:50.500
own power. You could be stepping into your own power


2992
02:31:50.500 --> 02:31:53.500
as a Healer like a career in healing


2993
02:31:53.500 --> 02:31:55.000
or you need to heal your own.


2994
02:31:56.800 --> 02:31:59.800
Personality in your own sense of Happiness by figuring


2995
02:31:59.800 --> 02:32:02.600
out what it is career-wise and


2996
02:32:02.600 --> 02:32:05.500
career goal-wise and and anything that has to do with long-term goals


2997
02:32:05.500 --> 02:32:08.000
structuring your life that is going to make you happy.


2998
02:32:11.200 --> 02:32:14.700
I've always been made to fear my SAT in return everybody might


2999
02:32:14.700 --> 02:32:17.000
started yesterday. Oh, so what's happened recently?


3000
02:32:18.200 --> 02:32:21.200
If it started recently, there should have been an event


3001
02:32:21.200 --> 02:32:22.300
within the house.


3002
02:32:24.100 --> 02:32:27.400
Everybody Talks, so poorly about Saturn return.


3003
02:32:27.400 --> 02:32:30.200
Look I was homeless for over two years in my Santa


3004
02:32:30.200 --> 02:32:32.300
return, but you know, why because I kept fighting it.


3005
02:32:37.200 --> 02:32:40.300
Saturn can be a harsh teacher and that's exactly


3006
02:32:40.300 --> 02:32:43.600
what happened to me. I fought Saturn at everything and Saturn brings


3007
02:32:43.600 --> 02:32:46.800
opportunity not in the same way of Jupiter does but Saturn


3008
02:32:46.800 --> 02:32:49.400
will put something in your plate and say do this. This is this


3009
02:32:49.400 --> 02:32:52.200
is what you're supposed to be doing and you're like, I'm not doing that. I don't want to do that.


3010
02:32:52.900 --> 02:32:55.300
And then Saturn's like okay fine for me. You're gonna


3011
02:32:55.300 --> 02:32:58.300
be homeless for two years. That's exactly what happened. I didn't have


3012
02:32:58.300 --> 02:32:58.500
to be


3013
02:32:59.300 --> 02:33:00.700
but I fought everything.


3014
02:33:03.300 --> 02:33:05.500
And you know, that's the way that it played out.


3015
02:33:08.800 --> 02:33:11.200
I've Saturn in the seventh House of Pisces, but


3016
02:33:11.200 --> 02:33:14.100
nothing huge has happened out of the norm that I could think


3017
02:33:14.100 --> 02:33:14.200
of.


3018
02:33:15.200 --> 02:33:18.200
If it started yesterday, you still have a week or two before it will.


3019
02:33:19.300 --> 02:33:22.700
Present itself because in order for transits to like Saturn


3020
02:33:22.700 --> 02:33:25.000
Saturn's a long-term Planet. So in order for


3021
02:33:25.300 --> 02:33:28.600
something to actually happen other planets have to click in as well. So


3022
02:33:28.600 --> 02:33:31.200
it doesn't always happen on the day. So within the next week or two,


3023
02:33:31.200 --> 02:33:33.100
we'll see what happens in terms of relationships.


3024
02:33:34.100 --> 02:33:37.800
for you or potentially starting your own business or the


3025
02:33:37.800 --> 02:33:38.700
the urge to


3026
02:33:41.900 --> 02:33:44.900
or anything that has to do with like a one-on-one interaction


3027
02:33:44.900 --> 02:33:47.200
that kind of kicks it off based on all the other


3028
02:33:47.200 --> 02:33:48.200
transits that happen.


3029
02:33:50.800 --> 02:33:53.900
Does does that Transit Saturn


3030
02:33:53.900 --> 02:33:54.300
conjunct?


3031
02:33:54.800 --> 02:33:57.700
Transit Sun aspect any other


3032
02:33:57.700 --> 02:34:00.800
transits that influence your natal moon or conjuncture


3033
02:34:00.800 --> 02:34:02.500
Vesta? Does it work it does work like that.


3034
02:34:03.600 --> 02:34:06.600
I didn't actually look to be honest with you. So here's


3035
02:34:06.600 --> 02:34:09.300
the Sun at 24 here Saturn at 27. So


3036
02:34:09.300 --> 02:34:13.800
it's a three degree orb of influence. There is right


3037
02:34:12.800 --> 02:34:15.700
here with Venus to the


3038
02:34:15.700 --> 02:34:19.200
sun. Anyway, a semi-sex tile


3039
02:34:18.200 --> 02:34:21.300
which we would have to look at. So that is creating.


3040
02:34:22.300 --> 02:34:25.300
That would be creating Discord. Where am


3041
02:34:25.300 --> 02:34:26.100
I looking here?


3042
02:34:27.300 --> 02:34:30.100
So Venus is right here creating Discord between this so I would


3043
02:34:30.100 --> 02:34:31.100
have to appease.


3044
02:34:32.400 --> 02:34:37.000
um, it's so it's so ironic too


3045
02:34:36.000 --> 02:34:37.200
because


3046
02:34:38.900 --> 02:34:41.300
So the eighth house, which is


3047
02:34:41.300 --> 02:34:44.000
ruled by Pluto has to do with the past.


3048
02:34:44.900 --> 02:34:48.000
We talked about that a couple of times here and Venus


3049
02:34:47.100 --> 02:34:50.800
has to do with value and Neptune has


3050
02:34:50.800 --> 02:34:53.300
to do with illusion and compassion and


3051
02:34:53.300 --> 02:34:56.100
things like that. If I were to look at my chart, I wouldn't need so many


3052
02:34:56.100 --> 02:34:59.300
Terror readings for my wife because I was so like trying to


3053
02:34:59.300 --> 02:35:02.600
fight this the reason I'm fighting it is because it's freaking semester.


3054
02:35:02.600 --> 02:35:05.100
This is this is why you asked Taylor so I could see


3055
02:35:05.100 --> 02:35:08.500
this I've been fighting this because this silly semi


3056
02:35:08.500 --> 02:35:08.800
sex tile


3057
02:35:10.500 --> 02:35:13.200
But anyway, yeah, it's creating it to this value and money.


3058
02:35:13.200 --> 02:35:16.100
I'm like doing this isn't going to bring me anything. It's not gonna bring me


3059
02:35:16.100 --> 02:35:19.400
any money. So basically what I'm doing is I'm spinning off all


3060
02:35:19.400 --> 02:35:22.100
my own and kind of like giving advice to help


3061
02:35:22.100 --> 02:35:25.200
people, you know gain power


3062
02:35:25.200 --> 02:35:28.300
over their lives and become entrepreneurs and really use


3063
02:35:28.300 --> 02:35:31.900
their talents. I kind of do that a lot in astrology, but I want to do this with and


3064
02:35:31.900 --> 02:35:34.500
without astrology and I'm like do I use astrology do


3065
02:35:34.500 --> 02:35:37.300
I include astrology? So that's kind of being a


3066
02:35:37.300 --> 02:35:40.200
whole thing. And the other thing is that Venus which is


3067
02:35:40.200 --> 02:35:43.400
creating a semi sex tile to this conjunction, which is conjunction to


3068
02:35:43.400 --> 02:35:46.600
my moon is creating a square at 2020 degrees


3069
02:35:46.600 --> 02:35:50.800
here to my 21 degree son, which


3070
02:35:50.800 --> 02:35:53.500
is opposite my Neptune and


3071
02:35:53.500 --> 02:35:56.200
then also has that grand trying so you can see how


3072
02:35:56.200 --> 02:35:59.600
involved if it can get you have to break. You don't want to get overwhelmed. I'm


3073
02:35:59.600 --> 02:36:00.600
sorry. You can't see any of that.


3074
02:36:01.800 --> 02:36:04.200
So this is the semi sextile right


3075
02:36:04.200 --> 02:36:07.500
here Venus to this whole thing right here and then


3076
02:36:07.500 --> 02:36:10.300
Venus at 20 and my son at 21.


3077
02:36:10.300 --> 02:36:14.100
That's a square. So it's creating the agitation that conflict


3078
02:36:13.100 --> 02:36:16.800
between what I want to do and it


3079
02:36:16.800 --> 02:36:19.300
is an online thing Community friends things


3080
02:36:19.300 --> 02:36:22.400
like that. So I created a podcast long story short as


3081
02:36:22.400 --> 02:36:26.300
I created a podcast and I thought


3082
02:36:26.300 --> 02:36:29.000
I wanted to do politics and then like I wanted to


3083
02:36:29.200 --> 02:36:32.400
do politics in a way that was like Unity unifying people and


3084
02:36:32.400 --> 02:36:35.300
it just backfired because I approached it in a way that was


3085
02:36:35.300 --> 02:36:38.500
like, you know what you're doing silly and then people on


3086
02:36:38.500 --> 02:36:41.100
one side like yeah, and then I'd be like no no what you're doing


3087
02:36:41.100 --> 02:36:44.100
silly and everybody be like on this side like yeah and maybe like no


3088
02:36:44.100 --> 02:36:47.200
and then the unfollow and you know, because people are weird about


3089
02:36:47.200 --> 02:36:50.300
that kind of stuff and I got blocked and


3090
02:36:50.300 --> 02:36:53.300
and what do you call it a band


3091
02:36:53.300 --> 02:36:56.200
off at tiktok, like six or seven times? I ended up


3092
02:36:56.200 --> 02:36:59.100
stopping it a few times on my own be like, I don't know.


3093
02:36:59.100 --> 02:37:01.400
This is kind of making me upset like people


3094
02:37:01.800 --> 02:37:02.800
negative. I don't like it.


3095
02:37:03.700 --> 02:37:06.000
And then I was sitting here like, you know, I kind of want to


3096
02:37:06.100 --> 02:37:09.200
do what I'm doing with Mystic Rebels, but I don't want to be strapped to


3097
02:37:09.200 --> 02:37:12.100
just astrology. I want to use more of my own life. I want to talk more about my


3098
02:37:12.100 --> 02:37:15.700
other projects. I want to be able to infuse just what


3099
02:37:15.700 --> 02:37:18.200
I what I think about anything like if I want to talk about


3100
02:37:18.200 --> 02:37:21.200
this water bottle. I want to be able to talk about


3101
02:37:21.200 --> 02:37:21.900
this water bottle.


3102
02:37:23.100 --> 02:37:26.500
And not in like I want to do car reviews at


3103
02:37:26.500 --> 02:37:29.000
some point, but I don't want to have a car review Channel. But anyways, that was


3104
02:37:29.200 --> 02:37:32.100
my whole conflict and that's what it comes down to is the


3105
02:37:32.100 --> 02:37:35.500
eighth house has to do transformation and I'm literally taking an old


3106
02:37:35.500 --> 02:37:38.500
name that has not been successful thus far


3107
02:37:38.500 --> 02:37:41.600
in my opinion and we using the


3108
02:37:41.600 --> 02:37:44.500
name and the logo to restart the


3109
02:37:44.500 --> 02:37:47.200
same type of project, but I'm trying to figure out how to do it. And this


3110
02:37:47.200 --> 02:37:50.600
is it. It's I have to appease this whole thing which is


3111
02:37:50.600 --> 02:37:53.100
the transit going on right now. That's why yesterday and today


3112
02:37:53.100 --> 02:37:57.600
this has been the theme because I have to use these energies to


3113
02:37:56.600 --> 02:37:59.300
pull it together. So I am


3114
02:37:59.300 --> 02:38:02.300
using that and it I am moving forward with it.


3115
02:38:02.300 --> 02:38:05.500
But I you know figuring out exactly what it


3116
02:38:05.500 --> 02:38:09.700
is because Neptune's in that same house that's been


3117
02:38:09.700 --> 02:38:12.700
the challenge is figure out what it is and realizing I've been


3118
02:38:12.700 --> 02:38:15.200
struggling with whether or not it kind of do like a tough. Love thing or


3119
02:38:15.200 --> 02:38:18.400
if I'm just a bit more compassionate and compassion always


3120
02:38:18.400 --> 02:38:20.800
wins out even if it's not good for views.


3121
02:38:21.700 --> 02:38:24.300
So that's the way that I've kind of decided to


3122
02:38:24.300 --> 02:38:24.600
go and


3123
02:38:25.500 --> 02:38:28.300
using like my history in film.


3124
02:38:28.300 --> 02:38:30.400
I think I'm going to include as well.


3125
02:38:31.900 --> 02:38:34.500
Does that send us so that


3126
02:38:34.500 --> 02:38:34.600
is?


3127
02:38:35.600 --> 02:38:38.300
In the Vesta is it's like I really want to


3128
02:38:38.300 --> 02:38:41.400
do it. I really want to have my own thing. So that's why Vesta was


3129
02:38:41.400 --> 02:38:41.900
so important there.


3130
02:38:45.300 --> 02:38:45.900
am I


3131
02:38:47.400 --> 02:38:50.600
Angela says I'm frozen. No sound. Is that


3132
02:38:50.600 --> 02:38:52.400
for everybody? Because I still see me.


3133
02:38:59.400 --> 02:39:00.800
Okay, Angie still hears you.


3134
02:39:01.400 --> 02:39:04.700
Angela might have to okay good. Thank


3135
02:39:04.700 --> 02:39:08.800
you guys. Angela might have to restart or


3136
02:39:07.800 --> 02:39:10.300
hop out and hop back in.


3137
02:39:10.300 --> 02:39:13.600
Ah, there she go she did I refresh this working great awesome.


3138
02:39:15.400 --> 02:39:18.400
Um, would you mind showing example of an


3139
02:39:18.400 --> 02:39:21.500
ash on Astro of a Saturn return? I need


3140
02:39:21.500 --> 02:39:21.900
a visual.


3141
02:39:23.800 --> 02:39:26.300
I mean, it's gonna look just like this. It's gonna look


3142
02:39:26.300 --> 02:39:27.700
here I use mine.


3143
02:39:32.800 --> 02:39:35.700
When was my Center return 2010 ish is


3144
02:39:35.700 --> 02:39:36.600
in there Zone?


3145
02:39:39.900 --> 02:39:41.300
so there is


3146
02:39:42.800 --> 02:39:44.800
that's right. I went in and out of my Center return.


3147
02:39:45.500 --> 02:39:47.600
Oh, no, I didn't I was in it just had a retrograde.


3148
02:39:48.600 --> 02:39:49.900
That was a fun time.


3149
02:39:51.400 --> 02:39:54.600
So here's 15 degrees Saturn returns of 15 degree orb


3150
02:39:54.600 --> 02:39:57.400
of influence. So mine started basically when Saturn entered


3151
02:39:57.400 --> 02:40:00.700
Libra just shortly after this is


3152
02:40:00.700 --> 02:40:01.900
it this is a Saturn return.


3153
02:40:02.700 --> 02:40:05.500
That right there and then you have to look at everything else at


3154
02:40:05.500 --> 02:40:08.800
that point. Saturn was also conjunct my Mars. I remember


3155
02:40:08.800 --> 02:40:11.500
some things that had happened at that time, which were


3156
02:40:11.500 --> 02:40:13.000
not wonderful.


3157
02:40:13.800 --> 02:40:15.100
Yeah, I remember that time.


3158
02:40:15.900 --> 02:40:18.900
Pluto is over my


3159
02:40:18.900 --> 02:40:20.000
Juno.


3160
02:40:20.900 --> 02:40:21.700
I remember that.


3161
02:40:22.600 --> 02:40:25.600
And then Chiron over my moon the sun


3162
02:40:25.600 --> 02:40:26.800
over my Vesta.


3163
02:40:27.300 --> 02:40:30.200
There's a lot going on at that time and then shortly after


3164
02:40:30.200 --> 02:40:32.600
Mars was over my sentence. So


3165
02:40:35.400 --> 02:40:38.800
so Saturn will be over whatever else you.


3166
02:40:39.700 --> 02:40:42.200
Have Center no it's within 15


3167
02:40:42.200 --> 02:40:45.900
degrees. So if you have Saturn at two degrees Libra or


3168
02:40:45.900 --> 02:40:48.500
let's just use a Pisces if


3169
02:40:48.500 --> 02:40:51.800
you have Saturn at two degrees Pisces and you have to subtract 15


3170
02:40:51.800 --> 02:40:54.800
degrees, which means you're Saturn actually your


3171
02:40:54.800 --> 02:40:58.000
Saturn return actually started at 17 degrees Aquarius.


3172
02:40:59.200 --> 02:41:02.700
And then you have two and a half ish years. It's different for everybody. But


3173
02:41:02.700 --> 02:41:05.100
two and a half ish years of a Saturn return to go through.


3174
02:41:06.800 --> 02:41:08.400
And the second half becomes easier.


3175
02:41:09.600 --> 02:41:10.800
Unless there's retrogrades.


3176
02:41:11.700 --> 02:41:14.300
But the house it's not the house. It's the degrees.


3177
02:41:18.200 --> 02:41:21.300
You do go through multiple you go through one from 27 to


3178
02:41:21.300 --> 02:41:24.200
31 at some point for two years in there.


3179
02:41:24.200 --> 02:41:26.000
And then when you're 50


3180
02:41:26.900 --> 02:41:27.700
fourish


3181
02:41:28.500 --> 02:41:31.300
to 58 ish in that frame


3182
02:41:31.300 --> 02:41:34.200
you go through another one. It's every 27 to


3183
02:41:34.200 --> 02:41:37.900
30 years. You'll go through a Saturn return because Saturn it


3184
02:41:37.900 --> 02:41:40.300
that's how long it takes Saturn to go through each side


3185
02:41:40.300 --> 02:41:40.900
of the zodiac.


3186
02:41:43.800 --> 02:41:46.800
So does the sun being conjunct


3187
02:41:46.800 --> 02:41:49.500
Saturn in the transit? Does it soften


3188
02:41:49.500 --> 02:41:53.200
Sanders restriction at all? I don't


3189
02:41:53.200 --> 02:41:57.500
know that it's softens. It's restriction it it created


3190
02:41:56.500 --> 02:41:59.600
highlights. If anything it


3191
02:41:59.600 --> 02:42:02.600
highlights the creative expression within


3192
02:42:02.600 --> 02:42:04.500
the long term goals.


3193
02:42:06.400 --> 02:42:09.100
It can it can help you align with


3194
02:42:09.100 --> 02:42:12.900
your ego with ego with pride with happiness.


3195
02:42:13.700 --> 02:42:16.500
So it gives you an opportunity during those few days


3196
02:42:16.500 --> 02:42:19.500
to really look at long-term things


3197
02:42:19.500 --> 02:42:22.000
and say what's what is it? That's going to


3198
02:42:22.200 --> 02:42:25.300
make it make it happy. I don't know if soften is the right word, but it definitely


3199
02:42:25.300 --> 02:42:28.300
changes the flavor or the color.


3200
02:42:28.300 --> 02:42:29.800
I used to call it color theory.


3201
02:42:30.300 --> 02:42:33.200
But it changes the color coloring of it so that


3202
02:42:33.200 --> 02:42:36.300
it's not only Saturn. So I guess in that


3203
02:42:36.300 --> 02:42:39.700
way it does soften it but Saturn's still


3204
02:42:39.700 --> 02:42:42.400
at full power. It's just Amplified with the Sun.


3205
02:42:42.400 --> 02:42:45.400
So it's really shining a light on things. A


3206
02:42:45.400 --> 02:42:49.400
lot of people these few days are really focusing on Career ideas


3207
02:42:48.400 --> 02:42:51.600
career opportunities and things for long-term


3208
02:42:51.600 --> 02:42:54.300
goals. Sometimes it's not career. Sometimes it's


3209
02:42:54.300 --> 02:42:57.300
just like I'm looking to do something in a


3210
02:42:57.300 --> 02:42:57.900
certain amount of time.


3211
02:42:58.800 --> 02:43:01.100
And that's being highlighted as well.


3212
02:43:02.400 --> 02:43:05.700
And authority and having authority over whatever


3213
02:43:05.700 --> 02:43:07.200
area of life it is.


3214
02:43:08.200 --> 02:43:12.300
Pushing a real or realizing that you don't have authority can


3215
02:43:11.300 --> 02:43:14.700
also be it because you're talking about potential conjunctions.


3216
02:43:15.900 --> 02:43:18.500
Or squares or whatever you have to look at everything but


3217
02:43:18.500 --> 02:43:21.500
yeah, it adds more to it. And in


3218
02:43:21.500 --> 02:43:24.700
that case because you're blending the energies it can feel softer, but


3219
02:43:24.700 --> 02:43:25.800
it's still intense.


3220
02:43:28.900 --> 02:43:31.300
Pluto is about to Transit into my first house


3221
02:43:31.300 --> 02:43:34.600
and I'm scared because astrologers preached so much Doom and Gloom. Yeah, it sucks


3222
02:43:34.600 --> 02:43:37.400
that they do that Pluto over your first house just means everything


3223
02:43:37.400 --> 02:43:40.600
in your world is going to change that. I just


3224
02:43:40.600 --> 02:43:43.200
went through that. I didn't go through. I went through a


3225
02:43:43.200 --> 02:43:47.200
Pluto Square which is probably worse because it's


3226
02:43:46.200 --> 02:43:48.400
a square. I fought it.


3227
02:43:49.200 --> 02:43:52.300
And it's fighting my own stuff. And then now I'm


3228
02:43:52.300 --> 02:43:53.500
in a Neptune Square.


3229
02:43:54.600 --> 02:43:57.200
Pluto going over your first house


3230
02:43:57.200 --> 02:43:57.800
just means that.


3231
02:43:59.500 --> 02:44:02.300
Who you are as a person your physical body the way


3232
02:44:02.300 --> 02:44:05.100
that you treat yourself. You're the way that you express yourself the way


3233
02:44:05.100 --> 02:44:08.600
you attack the world all of it's going to go through a in the


3234
02:44:08.600 --> 02:44:11.400
next 20 years. It's a long Transit and obviously


3235
02:44:11.400 --> 02:44:14.100
it's much more poignant when it hits your


3236
02:44:14.100 --> 02:44:17.100
ascendant within a couple of degrees. It just means


3237
02:44:17.100 --> 02:44:18.900
that everything in your world is going to change.


3238
02:44:19.800 --> 02:44:21.300
and Pluto


3239
02:44:22.200 --> 02:44:25.600
Pluto's power so really Pluto over


3240
02:44:25.600 --> 02:44:28.600
your first house is giving you the opportunity to


3241
02:44:28.600 --> 02:44:32.200
change the question is do you want to harness Pluto


3242
02:44:31.200 --> 02:44:34.300
or do you want Pluto to like run your


3243
02:44:34.300 --> 02:44:34.600
life?


3244
02:44:35.400 --> 02:44:38.400
If you allow Pluto to run your life and you don't use Pluto


3245
02:44:38.400 --> 02:44:41.200
at all, and you try to resist change, it can be really bad.


3246
02:44:41.200 --> 02:44:42.500
That's the dooming Gloom.


3247
02:44:43.300 --> 02:44:45.900
You can use it to say you know, what?


3248
02:44:46.800 --> 02:44:49.700
Things are now starting to present themselves


3249
02:44:49.700 --> 02:44:52.200
where I never thought I would do this or I have


3250
02:44:52.200 --> 02:44:55.300
the opportunity to change this or there's just a lot of things that


3251
02:44:55.300 --> 02:44:57.700
are coming. It's 20 years. So for me.


3252
02:44:58.800 --> 02:45:00.400
Pluto entered


3253
02:45:01.400 --> 02:45:03.200
Pluto entered my sixth house


3254
02:45:03.900 --> 02:45:06.200
in 2008 at the


3255
02:45:06.200 --> 02:45:09.100
end of 2008 and it's leaving now.


3256
02:45:10.100 --> 02:45:13.600
in Capricorn and that's my South node,


3257
02:45:13.600 --> 02:45:15.000
and it just


3258
02:45:17.400 --> 02:45:20.000
I went from Verizon was the last


3259
02:45:20.300 --> 02:45:24.300
company I worked for I went from working for Verizon in 2008 in


3260
02:45:23.300 --> 02:45:26.400
2009. I left Verizon and became


3261
02:45:26.400 --> 02:45:29.200
an entrepreneur. I haven't worked for anybody since then that was


3262
02:45:29.200 --> 02:45:30.100
Pluto that did that.


3263
02:45:30.900 --> 02:45:31.100
so


3264
02:45:31.900 --> 02:45:35.400
when when I say it that way and yeah,


3265
02:45:35.400 --> 02:45:38.400
I I was homeless during that time, but that was my Saturn return


3266
02:45:38.400 --> 02:45:39.200
I was


3267
02:45:40.800 --> 02:45:43.400
I've gone through a lot of transformation. I


3268
02:45:43.400 --> 02:45:46.400
went from selling cell phones to homeless to


3269
02:45:46.400 --> 02:45:49.700
background and audience work to becoming a director producer working


3270
02:45:49.700 --> 02:45:52.500
music videos working Hollywood Videos Pluto over


3271
02:45:52.500 --> 02:45:55.300
my sixth house. I also worked in the adult entertainment industry for


3272
02:45:55.300 --> 02:45:57.700
quite a bit. I was a club promoter.


3273
02:45:59.500 --> 02:46:02.700
I ended up teaching myself how to build websites and got into


3274
02:46:02.700 --> 02:46:05.900
Tech. I'm about to get into real estate and fashion.


3275
02:46:05.900 --> 02:46:08.800
We do astrology. I use Pluto


3276
02:46:08.800 --> 02:46:11.100
to now do the occult work in Tarot and


3277
02:46:11.100 --> 02:46:14.500
things like that. The thing is when it comes to my work


3278
02:46:14.500 --> 02:46:17.500
and my daily and even my health, I was a bodybuilder


3279
02:46:17.500 --> 02:46:22.000
for several years during that time. That's


3280
02:46:20.200 --> 02:46:23.600
all Pluto Pluto is


3281
02:46:23.600 --> 02:46:23.900
power.


3282
02:46:24.700 --> 02:46:27.300
So when it comes to your first house so my career


3283
02:46:27.300 --> 02:46:31.200
changed a lot because this is my sixth house my health changed and


3284
02:46:30.200 --> 02:46:33.500
for the better I started, you know, when I


3285
02:46:33.500 --> 02:46:36.800
allowed Pluto to be beneficial. I


3286
02:46:36.800 --> 02:46:40.800
started taking control of my health bodybuilding nutrition


3287
02:46:40.800 --> 02:46:41.900
all that kind of stuff.


3288
02:46:42.900 --> 02:46:44.200
when it goes over your first house, it's


3289
02:46:45.100 --> 02:46:48.400
Taking control over how you can evolve and become better.


3290
02:46:48.400 --> 02:46:51.100
If you try to stay the same. It's not going to


3291
02:46:51.100 --> 02:46:54.400
be good. If you allow the evolution and take that power


3292
02:46:54.400 --> 02:46:57.000
to step into your power fluid over the first


3293
02:46:57.300 --> 02:47:00.700
house can be amazing. So I wouldn't fear it unless you're trying


3294
02:47:00.700 --> 02:47:00.800
to


3295
02:47:02.300 --> 02:47:04.400
not go with it. If you try to fight the energy, it's not fun.


3296
02:47:05.700 --> 02:47:08.100
I have questions about interpreting transits, but you said you're


3297
02:47:08.100 --> 02:47:11.200
going to have a Transit class. I'm trying to refrain from Rapid Fire questions.


3298
02:47:11.200 --> 02:47:14.300
I am you're welcome Brenna. I am


3299
02:47:14.300 --> 02:47:14.900
going to have


3300
02:47:19.300 --> 02:47:22.300
I am going to have a separate Transit class because


3301
02:47:23.500 --> 02:47:24.100
transits


3302
02:47:25.300 --> 02:47:26.900
I wanted to introduce transits because


3303
02:47:28.100 --> 02:47:31.500
when you talk about transits aspects come into that plague like


3304
02:47:31.500 --> 02:47:34.600
transits Jupiter over my my eighth


3305
02:47:34.600 --> 02:47:34.700
house.


3306
02:47:36.500 --> 02:47:39.400
Actually, it's in it's that's from 2010 Jupiter over my


3307
02:47:39.400 --> 02:47:43.400
ninth house in Aries at certain


3308
02:47:42.400 --> 02:47:45.800
points doesn't aspect much so it


3309
02:47:45.800 --> 02:47:48.300
doesn't mean too much. But when it's in opposition of


3310
02:47:48.300 --> 02:47:51.200
my my Mars, I have to


3311
02:47:51.200 --> 02:47:52.400
bring third and Ninth house.


3312
02:47:53.500 --> 02:47:56.300
Energies together so it it creates that


3313
02:47:56.300 --> 02:47:56.900
aspect.


3314
02:47:58.500 --> 02:48:01.300
Which is why I included some of it in this class but to go


3315
02:48:01.300 --> 02:48:03.200
through how it actually impacts in general.


3316
02:48:04.200 --> 02:48:07.400
It's like taking snapshots and freeze


3317
02:48:07.400 --> 02:48:10.300
frames of a moment in time. And then analyzing where


3318
02:48:10.300 --> 02:48:13.100
everything is and how it is or isn't working together. And you know what


3319
02:48:13.100 --> 02:48:16.200
while I was homeless. I did not realize that all this freaking energy was


3320
02:48:16.200 --> 02:48:16.900
sitting like that.


3321
02:48:23.800 --> 02:48:26.100
And then Brenna asteroids, I'm gonna have a


3322
02:48:26.100 --> 02:48:29.000
separate class on asteroids. So Chiron Vesta.


3323
02:48:31.600 --> 02:48:34.800
Phallus. I don't know why I can't think right now. I don't


3324
02:48:34.800 --> 02:48:35.700
know if I'll do Eris.


3325
02:48:36.500 --> 02:48:40.100
Palace definitely and then


3326
02:48:40.100 --> 02:48:43.200
I have a separate class at Juno definitely as well. I'm gonna have another


3327
02:48:43.200 --> 02:48:46.300
class on OEM series. We have


3328
02:48:46.300 --> 02:48:49.600
another class on the moon which will be the Moon


3329
02:48:49.600 --> 02:48:53.300
the Moon phases and Cycles a lunar


3330
02:48:53.300 --> 02:48:56.900
returns and then Lilith and the nodes I'll be


3331
02:48:56.900 --> 02:48:57.100
talking about


3332
02:48:58.300 --> 02:48:59.600
so that's pretty fun, too.


3333
02:49:06.800 --> 02:49:09.300
I have let me get through this last slide real quick.


3334
02:49:12.300 --> 02:49:15.600
Because some of this you're asking planetary Transit meanings


3335
02:49:15.600 --> 02:49:18.700
this in you'll have a copy of this but this


3336
02:49:18.700 --> 02:49:21.400
is what each planet means when it


3337
02:49:21.400 --> 02:49:24.400
passes over your house or it forms


3338
02:49:24.400 --> 02:49:28.000
an aspect. This is what you have to pay attention to when the sun transits through


3339
02:49:27.600 --> 02:49:30.300
either a house or hit something


3340
02:49:30.300 --> 02:49:33.300
you feel energized. It brings creative expression children


3341
02:49:33.300 --> 02:49:37.200
can be a focus. You just have to be very careful of overconfidence in


3342
02:49:36.200 --> 02:49:39.700
this Arena or being egotistical or


3343
02:49:39.700 --> 02:49:42.200
having too much pride. You want to balance that out and you want to


3344
02:49:42.200 --> 02:49:45.400
use it for happiness the moon I talk


3345
02:49:45.400 --> 02:49:48.100
about this. I'm gonna have a class just on moon I think


3346
02:49:48.100 --> 02:49:51.300
or I know but I'm also going to talk about the transits in


3347
02:49:51.300 --> 02:49:51.500
that class.


3348
02:49:52.300 --> 02:49:53.200
because the Moon


3349
02:49:54.400 --> 02:49:57.400
I follow Moon trance. It's all the time. I never used to pay much


3350
02:49:57.400 --> 02:50:00.500
attention to the Moon until I realized how impactful on


3351
02:50:00.500 --> 02:50:03.400
a daily not even a daily an hourly


3352
02:50:03.400 --> 02:50:06.500
basis. The Moon is earlier today. I


3353
02:50:06.500 --> 02:50:09.300
was having all kinds of issues and I ended up in a slum


3354
02:50:09.300 --> 02:50:12.800
and I was just like I don't even understand why I'm feeling it. I understood


3355
02:50:12.800 --> 02:50:15.100
the energy. So I left the house when I left the house. I was


3356
02:50:15.100 --> 02:50:18.200
fine when I came back home not feeling so great left the house


3357
02:50:18.200 --> 02:50:21.900
again, and it's like I wasn't I


3358
02:50:21.900 --> 02:50:24.600
wasn't looking to like to remedy everything.


3359
02:50:24.600 --> 02:50:28.300
I just knew that if I left the house. I was fine, but it


3360
02:50:27.300 --> 02:50:30.600
triggers emotional reactions to people or


3361
02:50:30.600 --> 02:50:33.700
situation often time. The moon squares your


3362
02:50:33.700 --> 02:50:36.400
Saturn. Somebody is gonna have you're gonna have a conflict


3363
02:50:36.400 --> 02:50:40.700
with somebody over your career if Saturn is opposing your


3364
02:50:40.700 --> 02:50:43.600
moon you and your significant other may have


3365
02:50:43.600 --> 02:50:47.100
some sort of back and forth over which can


3366
02:50:46.100 --> 02:50:49.400
have a compromise over either money or


3367
02:50:49.400 --> 02:50:52.500
whatever house. It's sitting in like it's just the


3368
02:50:52.500 --> 02:50:54.200
moon could be conjunct when the


3369
02:50:54.400 --> 02:50:57.100
Junk's a planet. Like let's say it's Venus again and it comes


3370
02:50:57.100 --> 02:51:00.700
conjunct. It could be that a money issue presents itself


3371
02:51:00.700 --> 02:51:03.700
something of value something dealing with money within whatever


3372
02:51:03.700 --> 02:51:06.800
house it is and you have to take care of it or you choose


3373
02:51:06.800 --> 02:51:09.400
to let the moon pass by and deal with it later. Which


3374
02:51:09.400 --> 02:51:10.600
sometimes is the answer.


3375
02:51:11.500 --> 02:51:14.400
Can bring focus on the needs of resolve issues beyond the


3376
02:51:14.400 --> 02:51:17.400
initial agitation, Moon transits are extremely important to not


3377
02:51:17.400 --> 02:51:21.000
allow it to make you reactionary you


3378
02:51:20.300 --> 02:51:23.200
will you'll naturally want to react to it and


3379
02:51:23.200 --> 02:51:26.200
you have to be like no. I know this is the moon that's the


3380
02:51:26.200 --> 02:51:29.600
key is the whole point of learning astrology and moon transits. I


3381
02:51:29.600 --> 02:51:32.100
know the moon's doing this. So what is it that I


3382
02:51:32.100 --> 02:51:34.400
have to focus on. How do I handle this without?


3383
02:51:35.600 --> 02:51:38.300
Like causing issues for myself in the future because that's


3384
02:51:38.300 --> 02:51:39.500
what moon transits can do.


3385
02:51:40.500 --> 02:51:44.300
That's why I call the moon a little b sometimes because it's an


3386
02:51:43.300 --> 02:51:44.600
ish.


3387
02:51:45.100 --> 02:51:48.400
So s*** disturber, like a sensor myself as a s*** disturb or


3388
02:51:48.400 --> 02:51:48.700
sometimes.


3389
02:51:49.300 --> 02:51:52.200
At other times it can bring you to highlight and


3390
02:51:52.200 --> 02:51:55.400
focus on something that needs attention Mercury talks


3391
02:51:55.400 --> 02:51:58.600
about communication documents siblings cousins that could


3392
02:51:58.600 --> 02:52:02.900
come back into your life just communication in general. You


3393
02:52:01.900 --> 02:52:04.300
can also use it for sales and


3394
02:52:04.300 --> 02:52:07.300
things like that and organize or pay


3395
02:52:07.300 --> 02:52:10.400
attention to details of something Venus talks about partnership


3396
02:52:10.400 --> 02:52:13.100
love luxury and money Mars is all about


3397
02:52:13.100 --> 02:52:16.700
action. It's energy it brings extra energy in the


3398
02:52:16.700 --> 02:52:19.600
area that it's in or on the planet to do something. It's


3399
02:52:19.600 --> 02:52:22.600
also really good for sexual drive just be careful of arguments with


3400
02:52:22.600 --> 02:52:26.300
Mars involved Jupiter's all about expansion abundance


3401
02:52:25.300 --> 02:52:28.200
luck. It's a great time to


3402
02:52:28.200 --> 02:52:31.100
learn something and learn something new within the field that we're talking


3403
02:52:31.100 --> 02:52:31.300
about.


3404
02:52:32.200 --> 02:52:35.700
Be super cautious of overdoing. It's


3405
02:52:35.700 --> 02:52:38.400
also teaching. Sometimes it's learning. Sometimes it's teaching


3406
02:52:38.400 --> 02:52:41.800
for me right now. It's teaching careful of


3407
02:52:41.800 --> 02:52:45.900
arguments. I'm sorry cautious of overdoing Taylor's


3408
02:52:44.900 --> 02:52:47.400
here. You can get fat off


3409
02:52:47.400 --> 02:52:50.600
a Jupiter. You gotta just be careful with Jupiter because


3410
02:52:50.600 --> 02:52:53.300
it can make you over indulge in things.


3411
02:52:54.400 --> 02:52:57.800
Because it feels so freaking good Saturn is brings


3412
02:52:57.800 --> 02:53:00.700
restrictions in the way of long term goals. Really


3413
02:53:00.700 --> 02:53:03.200
what it does is Saturn paves out the way and


3414
02:53:03.200 --> 02:53:06.300
says focus on this and you know, you can't have all


3415
02:53:06.300 --> 02:53:09.100
your good stuff back until you focus on this and then once you


3416
02:53:09.100 --> 02:53:12.500
do all your good stuff can come back be careful of depression


3417
02:53:12.500 --> 02:53:15.100
and isolation with that Uranus is always abrupt change


3418
02:53:15.100 --> 02:53:18.700
in some way. Something is going to change it could be right now Venus


3419
02:53:18.700 --> 02:53:21.500
has been or you're in it's been over Venus for me. So


3420
02:53:21.500 --> 02:53:24.500
it's all about change and values change and self-worth change


3421
02:53:24.500 --> 02:53:27.800
in money Venus is in Taurus anyway, so change


3422
02:53:27.800 --> 02:53:30.200
and money technology with money A lot of times I have


3423
02:53:30.200 --> 02:53:33.800
to do with technology future dreams revolutionizing things. So


3424
02:53:33.800 --> 02:53:36.300
you're hearing a lot with Uranus and Taurus


3425
02:53:36.300 --> 02:53:39.700
about the digits digitization of money and


3426
02:53:39.700 --> 02:53:42.500
crypto has been a thing for a while, but it's coming back


3427
02:53:42.500 --> 02:53:42.800
in.


3428
02:53:43.900 --> 02:53:46.200
There with Uranus you have to be careful with


3429
02:53:46.200 --> 02:53:49.400
accidents and quick losses. So make sure you're paying attention, especially


3430
02:53:49.400 --> 02:53:52.500
when it's in Taurus. You don't want to lose money real quick. You want


3431
02:53:52.500 --> 02:53:56.100
that you want quick gains. If anything Neptune brings


3432
02:53:56.100 --> 02:54:00.200
illusion spiritualism. It's really good for understanding


3433
02:53:59.200 --> 02:54:02.200
when to be spiritual, but it's


3434
02:54:02.200 --> 02:54:05.900
Neptune tends to default to Illusions and deception. So


3435
02:54:05.900 --> 02:54:08.900
you have to be really careful with that intangible creativity


3436
02:54:08.900 --> 02:54:11.800
music in the area of life that's impacting. You


3437
02:54:11.800 --> 02:54:12.700
can use that for sure.


3438
02:54:13.600 --> 02:54:16.400
And creativity as well and then things


3439
02:54:16.400 --> 02:54:19.300
can dissolve and vanish in those areas of life.


3440
02:54:19.300 --> 02:54:22.200
So wherever Neptune is is going you might


3441
02:54:22.200 --> 02:54:25.300
lose something or you might see it as something


3442
02:54:25.300 --> 02:54:29.300
different it can either be something that dissolves or which


3443
02:54:28.300 --> 02:54:30.600
is usually what it is. So for me


3444
02:54:31.500 --> 02:54:35.000
For instance Neptune going over my eighth house. Something's dissolving


3445
02:54:34.200 --> 02:54:37.600
and transforming at the same time, which is an interesting


3446
02:54:37.600 --> 02:54:40.300
set of energy to wrap your head around and then


3447
02:54:40.300 --> 02:54:43.300
Pluto long-term upheaval and transformation


3448
02:54:43.300 --> 02:54:47.100
everything from the past comes to the surface. So transiting your


3449
02:54:46.100 --> 02:54:49.200
first house. You got to realize a lot of things


3450
02:54:49.200 --> 02:54:52.200
from the past are gonna come up and you're gonna have to say I don't want that. I want to change


3451
02:54:52.200 --> 02:54:55.400
from this. I want to you know, based on everything that's happened.


3452
02:54:55.400 --> 02:54:58.300
I want to be this instead and it


3453
02:54:58.300 --> 02:55:01.600
requires that transformation finding healthy control in those


3454
02:55:01.600 --> 02:55:04.500
areas of life in the first house. It's everything your control


3455
02:55:04.500 --> 02:55:05.400
over everything.


3456
02:55:06.600 --> 02:55:09.200
And just be careful of power struggles. Also be careful of


3457
02:55:09.200 --> 02:55:12.500
manipulation If It's Love related or


3458
02:55:12.500 --> 02:55:15.800
aspecting Venus or in your seventh house be careful of cheating and


3459
02:55:15.800 --> 02:55:18.800
things of that nature. So when the planets are


3460
02:55:18.800 --> 02:55:21.400
transiting this is what they're doing impacting you.


3461
02:55:23.100 --> 02:55:27.600
All right. So that's that first house.


3462
02:55:27.600 --> 02:55:30.300
Is it strange? I'm looking forward to it personally. And on


3463
02:55:30.300 --> 02:55:34.000
the Monday it's not strange. If you are fat off


3464
02:55:33.200 --> 02:55:36.100
of Jupiter Taylor says Angela, it's


3465
02:55:36.100 --> 02:55:39.700
not it's not strange. If you are looking for change, if


3466
02:55:39.700 --> 02:55:42.100
you feel like your life has been stagnant or you feel like


3467
02:55:42.100 --> 02:55:45.400
there's much more and you're looking to step into your personal power. I would


3468
02:55:45.400 --> 02:55:48.300
be excited for Pluto. I love Pluto. I live on a Pluto.


3469
02:55:48.300 --> 02:55:51.300
I see y'all that's I live here because it's


3470
02:55:51.300 --> 02:55:54.100
been highly transformational. I've been able to


3471
02:55:54.100 --> 02:55:57.600
step into my personal power here and do the things more


3472
02:55:57.600 --> 02:56:00.300
importantly Pluto. My I see is I can do all the things I want


3473
02:56:00.300 --> 02:56:00.600
to do.


3474
02:56:01.400 --> 02:56:04.600
On a deep deep level is long as I have


3475
02:56:04.600 --> 02:56:07.200
control and power over it. I can do whatever I want.


3476
02:56:08.300 --> 02:56:13.100
And that's the key and in this location Pluto ends


3477
02:56:12.100 --> 02:56:15.300
up being opposite my midheaven so I can


3478
02:56:15.300 --> 02:56:18.400
bring my mid Heaven my career my life


3479
02:56:18.400 --> 02:56:21.000
purpose into the things I want to do


3480
02:56:21.900 --> 02:56:24.600
on a very deep level in my childhood like my childhood stuff.


3481
02:56:24.600 --> 02:56:27.400
I can also take my childhood stuff and


3482
02:56:27.400 --> 02:56:30.800
use it for my career which is why I've been talking about my abuse


3483
02:56:30.800 --> 02:56:33.100
and my childhood and all the things growing up


3484
02:56:33.100 --> 02:56:36.100
and using my experience because Jupiter sitting right there as well.


3485
02:56:37.200 --> 02:56:40.300
So understanding those is those transits and those orbs of


3486
02:56:40.300 --> 02:56:43.300
influence and all that. You guys are going to get really good at putting this together


3487
02:56:43.300 --> 02:56:47.800
and you're gonna see it really transform your life. But yeah, absolutely looking


3488
02:56:46.800 --> 02:56:50.100
forward to change but realizing that


3489
02:56:50.100 --> 02:56:52.400
that change is not always easy.


3490
02:56:53.300 --> 02:56:56.900
And Pluto is not always like feel good


3491
02:56:56.900 --> 02:56:59.600
stuff. That's more Jupiter. It's it's


3492
02:56:59.600 --> 02:57:00.700
it can be


3493
02:57:01.700 --> 02:57:05.000
It can bring up a lot of like inner


3494
02:57:04.200 --> 02:57:07.200
turmoil and psychological stuff that


3495
02:57:07.200 --> 02:57:10.300
you'll have to deal with. But if you're ready for it, and you're


3496
02:57:10.300 --> 02:57:13.100
like I'm I'm jumping into this you're gonna put in the work you're gonna


3497
02:57:13.100 --> 02:57:16.600
do it and you're going to like cocoon into a butterfly


3498
02:57:16.600 --> 02:57:19.200
and it's just gonna be amazing. So don't be scared of it at


3499
02:57:19.200 --> 02:57:19.300
all.


3500
02:57:20.600 --> 02:57:23.200
How long does it take to Pluto to move


3501
02:57:23.200 --> 02:57:23.600
a degree?


3502
02:57:24.600 --> 02:57:27.300
It changes per sign, but since it takes about 20 years


3503
02:57:27.300 --> 02:57:27.800
to move.


3504
02:57:30.400 --> 02:57:33.300
In transits it this at least this was


3505
02:57:33.300 --> 02:57:36.400
15 to 20 years. So every year it would move two degrees.


3506
02:57:37.800 --> 02:57:39.700
Give or take a degree and a half to two degrees.


3507
02:57:44.500 --> 02:57:47.200
I can't wait. These classes are so fun. I'm glad that


3508
02:57:47.200 --> 02:57:50.400
you guys are enjoying it because I can't see y'all.


3509
02:57:50.400 --> 02:57:54.600
I can't talk to y'all. It's just me staring at a screen and what


3510
02:57:53.600 --> 02:57:55.300
I wanted.


3511
02:57:56.200 --> 02:57:59.600
was for these not to be boring because


3512
02:57:59.600 --> 02:58:02.200
I I researched a lot of other people's classes, and


3513
02:58:02.200 --> 02:58:02.900
I'm not trying to


3514
02:58:03.800 --> 02:58:06.800
To degrade or diminish what they've done but I


3515
02:58:06.800 --> 02:58:08.700
really had a hard time getting through some of them.


3516
02:58:09.600 --> 02:58:12.200
and I was I just really wanted to kind of put it


3517
02:58:12.200 --> 02:58:15.400
out there so that people would would be able to grab it plus some of


3518
02:58:15.400 --> 02:58:16.500
them were talking very


3519
02:58:20.600 --> 02:58:21.700
they're being very technical.


3520
02:58:22.600 --> 02:58:25.200
On how they explain things and I thought that was really hard to


3521
02:58:25.200 --> 02:58:28.900
follow. So I was trying to be as relatable as possible


3522
02:58:28.900 --> 02:58:29.300
with these.


3523
02:58:30.400 --> 02:58:33.100
I can really tell you care about sharing this information making sure we


3524
02:58:33.100 --> 02:58:36.800
understand that you put so much of yourself into his credibly inspiring my life


3525
02:58:36.800 --> 02:58:39.200
truly changed for the better ever since meeting. You and Ashley and


3526
02:58:39.200 --> 02:58:41.900
I can't begin to explain how grateful I am Taylor.


3527
02:58:44.400 --> 02:58:48.300
I am I am very like tough exterior,


3528
02:58:47.300 --> 02:58:50.400
but I'm so freaking sensitive when it comes to stuff


3529
02:58:50.400 --> 02:58:53.200
like that. I appreciate every compliment you guys


3530
02:58:53.200 --> 02:58:56.600
and I'm like, I'm not fishing, but I I appreciate


3531
02:58:56.600 --> 02:58:57.000
it.


3532
02:58:59.400 --> 02:59:03.000
Like I've always wanted to help people always and


3533
02:59:02.300 --> 02:59:05.800
the biggest thing is I've I've


3534
02:59:05.800 --> 02:59:08.200
tended to give it for


3535
02:59:08.200 --> 02:59:11.500
free not seeing the value in what I


3536
02:59:11.500 --> 02:59:14.500
know my knowledge. That's the other thing with my queen kunks


3537
02:59:14.500 --> 02:59:17.700
is I never really saw the value in what I what


3538
02:59:17.700 --> 02:59:20.100
I could have made a career out of or whatever and I used


3539
02:59:20.100 --> 02:59:24.000
to give away information for free and every single time. It's


3540
02:59:23.200 --> 02:59:26.200
always stabbed me in the foot either. I


3541
02:59:26.200 --> 02:59:29.400
was overly compassionate like I remember I ended up hiring


3542
02:59:29.400 --> 02:59:32.800
a few people and they ended up backstabbing me and no


3543
02:59:32.800 --> 02:59:35.300
one else would hire these people and I ended up hiring


3544
02:59:35.300 --> 02:59:38.400
then they and they they did those things. I remember when


3545
02:59:38.400 --> 02:59:40.000
I was getting out of a niche market.


3546
02:59:41.700 --> 02:59:44.200
And I was moving on and I tried to


3547
02:59:44.200 --> 02:59:47.200
like I was like, hey, I will help you guys make because I


3548
02:59:47.200 --> 02:59:50.100
was making doing the niche market stuff. I was


3549
02:59:50.100 --> 02:59:53.300
making 75 to 85,000 a month doing what other


3550
02:59:53.300 --> 02:59:56.500
people were struggling to make, you know, between two and


3551
02:59:56.500 --> 02:59:59.400
five thousand dollars a month and I was like, I'll teach you I don't


3552
02:59:59.400 --> 03:00:02.200
care. You don't even have to pay me. I was just wanted to help


3553
03:00:02.200 --> 03:00:03.800
and I I


3554
03:00:04.800 --> 03:00:07.200
it always ended up backfiring and it was always a waste


3555
03:00:07.200 --> 03:00:10.300
of my time and they wouldn't take the advice anyway, and


3556
03:00:10.300 --> 03:00:13.300
I was just like you guys don't even value it and I've I'm


3557
03:00:13.300 --> 03:00:16.600
came with receipts like here is my PayPal statement. Here's


3558
03:00:16.600 --> 03:00:19.400
my bank account. I'm showing you that this is exactly how


3559
03:00:19.400 --> 03:00:22.700
much I make and and whatnot and they were still like there was


3560
03:00:22.700 --> 03:00:25.100
only one person out of all those people who was on board,


3561
03:00:25.100 --> 03:00:26.900
but the rest of her team didn't want to put in the effort.


3562
03:00:27.600 --> 03:00:30.400
And I was like you guys wasted my time. I did meet George


3563
03:00:30.400 --> 03:00:33.900
Perez though and he is the the


3564
03:00:33.900 --> 03:00:34.600
one of the


3565
03:00:36.500 --> 03:00:39.200
the artists who used to draw Wonder Woman, so that was


3566
03:00:39.200 --> 03:00:40.300
cool. But


3567
03:00:41.600 --> 03:00:42.300
anyway, yeah.


3568
03:00:43.400 --> 03:00:46.300
Do you ever have anyone call or text you and ask why they are feeling out


3569
03:00:46.300 --> 03:00:49.600
of sorts and it's a moon Transit. Oh my mom all the


3570
03:00:49.600 --> 03:00:52.200
time my mom all the time and it's funny because


3571
03:00:52.200 --> 03:00:55.700
when I got into astrology, I don't think my mom ever shunned


3572
03:00:55.700 --> 03:00:59.100
it or anything, but she is she's Catholic and she's


3573
03:00:58.100 --> 03:01:02.000
I wouldn't say she's like devoured or anything, but she has


3574
03:01:01.300 --> 03:01:04.500
her faith and I got into astrology


3575
03:01:04.500 --> 03:01:07.200
and she never thought anything negative of it, but she never really


3576
03:01:07.200 --> 03:01:09.900
kind of we never really discussed it much and then


3577
03:01:10.800 --> 03:01:13.500
One day she just randomly messaged me


3578
03:01:13.500 --> 03:01:16.300
and she was like what's going on with the Stars?


3579
03:01:16.300 --> 03:01:19.800
This is happening. This is happening. Tell me what's going on. And that


3580
03:01:19.800 --> 03:01:22.300
was that was pretty awesome. And then


3581
03:01:22.300 --> 03:01:25.100
I told her I was like, well, this is happening here. This is happening.


3582
03:01:25.100 --> 03:01:28.300
I said don't do this for a couple of days do this and everything was fine.


3583
03:01:28.300 --> 03:01:31.300
And now every once in a while, she'd be like, what's what's going on


3584
03:01:31.300 --> 03:01:34.200
tell me what's going on and then I just I just


3585
03:01:34.200 --> 03:01:36.300
tell her so that's that's pretty awesome.


3586
03:01:38.300 --> 03:01:41.300
And it's usually Moon Transit Ashley and I talk about it all the time. We're like


3587
03:01:41.300 --> 03:01:44.900
baby won't sleep. Where's the moon? Actually that's in


3588
03:01:44.900 --> 03:01:48.300
our household here. One of


3589
03:01:48.300 --> 03:01:51.200
our main catchphrases is where's the moon? Where's the moon?


3590
03:01:51.200 --> 03:01:54.300
Where's the moon? Because when when you're feeling


3591
03:01:54.300 --> 03:01:57.800
a certain way or things are happening or like because we're


3592
03:01:57.800 --> 03:02:00.700
on social media when we see an influx


3593
03:02:00.700 --> 03:02:03.400
of like negative comments. First thing I do is where's the


3594
03:02:03.400 --> 03:02:06.300
moon? I see it. It's always accurate is


3595
03:02:06.300 --> 03:02:09.100
always the moon and then as soon


3596
03:02:09.100 --> 03:02:12.200
as I if I stop and I don't reply to those comments or I delete them


3597
03:02:12.200 --> 03:02:12.600
or whatever.


3598
03:02:13.600 --> 03:02:16.200
And I just move on and I don't reply and I


3599
03:02:16.200 --> 03:02:19.200
don't let it affect me the moon leaves and then all sudden


3600
03:02:19.200 --> 03:02:23.100
no more negative comments. It's so crazy because 10


3601
03:02:22.100 --> 03:02:25.600
years ago. I would have told you that you were nuts. If


3602
03:02:25.600 --> 03:02:29.100
you told me the moon impacted whether Joe Schmo


3603
03:02:28.100 --> 03:02:31.200
said something rude to me. I would


3604
03:02:31.200 --> 03:02:31.900
have been like you're crazy.


3605
03:02:32.800 --> 03:02:35.900
It was Joe schmo's decision to say


3606
03:02:35.900 --> 03:02:36.800
something rude to me.


3607
03:02:37.500 --> 03:02:41.000
And it's just so crazy. It's no it's the moon. It's


3608
03:02:40.400 --> 03:02:43.400
when it happens. It's the Moon that brought


3609
03:02:43.400 --> 03:02:46.200
that that brought that to you is just it's


3610
03:02:46.200 --> 03:02:49.500
just ridiculous or it's the moon on them sometimes but


3611
03:02:49.500 --> 03:02:50.900
it's just insane.


3612
03:02:53.700 --> 03:02:57.100
You really are the best teacher. Oh, thank you. I've understood


3613
03:02:56.100 --> 03:02:59.500
more with you than anyone. Thank you so much. I'm so


3614
03:02:59.500 --> 03:03:02.500
happy and the patients you show giving your time knowledge unparalleled.


3615
03:03:03.300 --> 03:03:05.200
I appreciate you guys so much.


3616
03:03:07.300 --> 03:03:10.600
I checked the moon before I even get out of bed. Yeah, because the


3617
03:03:10.600 --> 03:03:13.300
thing is and I try to tell people I'm like look with the


3618
03:03:13.300 --> 03:03:16.500
moon transits you could wake up like it's an amazing day


3619
03:03:16.500 --> 03:03:19.600
today. So awesome. It happened to me today today's amazing


3620
03:03:19.600 --> 03:03:21.700
and then like not even an hour or two later.


3621
03:03:22.500 --> 03:03:25.100
Just just weird energy and I just like what


3622
03:03:25.100 --> 03:03:28.600
that and I looked at the thing I say man, just the once


3623
03:03:28.600 --> 03:03:31.400
it hit that orb of influence it got three degrees


3624
03:03:31.400 --> 03:03:34.200
within my planet and then all the sudden


3625
03:03:34.200 --> 03:03:35.700
it's like holy crap, man.


3626
03:03:36.900 --> 03:03:37.200
so


3627
03:03:38.500 --> 03:03:38.800
yeah.


3628
03:03:39.700 --> 03:03:41.100
I check it all the time now.


3629
03:03:42.100 --> 03:03:44.100
Hopefully we have revalidated.


3630
03:03:45.300 --> 03:03:48.600
That you are valued and we need your teachings you have you


3631
03:03:48.600 --> 03:03:51.300
have and I've I've been my book


3632
03:03:51.300 --> 03:03:54.200
has been requested a lot. I really need to get I know I'm doing a


3633
03:03:54.200 --> 03:03:57.500
series of books. And now that I'm doing the Logan Theory


3634
03:03:57.500 --> 03:04:00.500
as well, you know, I have that as like self-help and


3635
03:04:00.500 --> 03:04:03.400
entrepreneur and trying to get people to really value their


3636
03:04:03.400 --> 03:04:06.200
own self-worth in a different way in the


3637
03:04:06.200 --> 03:04:09.200
fact that like like there's some people's like you want to do your


3638
03:04:09.200 --> 03:04:12.500
nine to five cool. Go do your nine to five you you need


3639
03:04:12.500 --> 03:04:15.200
that stability my buddies like that. My best friend is like that he has


3640
03:04:15.200 --> 03:04:18.500
to know when his vacation days how many has what is paycheck's


3641
03:04:18.500 --> 03:04:21.300
gonna be he has to know when he's getting up when he's going to work. That's fine.


3642
03:04:21.300 --> 03:04:24.500
But there are some of us who can't live that life and we


3643
03:04:24.500 --> 03:04:27.300
forced ourselves to work that corporate grind when we


3644
03:04:27.300 --> 03:04:30.500
could be earning for ourselves. And for


3645
03:04:30.500 --> 03:04:33.300
those people I'm like, look I can show it


3646
03:04:33.300 --> 03:04:36.200
to you. I can show you not only you know in the real


3647
03:04:36.200 --> 03:04:39.100
world, but I can use astrology. I have so many tools to be able to help


3648
03:04:39.100 --> 03:04:42.200
other people make money because I want to see more people just be like


3649
03:04:42.200 --> 03:04:44.700
living this amazing life and just go


3650
03:04:45.300 --> 03:04:48.700
on the beach when they want and they're just like even if they're not millionaires just


3651
03:04:48.700 --> 03:04:51.400
living a comfortable life where they're not getting


3652
03:04:51.400 --> 03:04:53.300
up. It's like you're trading freedom.


3653
03:04:54.100 --> 03:04:56.500
For you know for that it's crazy.


3654
03:04:57.600 --> 03:05:00.400
Your book. Yes, I need I am working on


3655
03:05:00.400 --> 03:05:03.600
the book. I just I think I'm gonna dictate it and then translate it


3656
03:05:03.600 --> 03:05:05.900
or transcode trans something.


3657
03:05:08.800 --> 03:05:12.200
Transcribe it. That's the word every Angie


3658
03:05:11.200 --> 03:05:14.600
every week. I almost talk myself out


3659
03:05:14.600 --> 03:05:17.200
of coming because I feel so insufficient, but I'm always glad


3660
03:05:17.200 --> 03:05:20.500
I came you're so authentic and direct your indirect and


3661
03:05:20.500 --> 03:05:23.400
your knowledge is just amazing, and you didn't break my free.


3662
03:05:25.700 --> 03:05:28.500
It's Angie. It's


3663
03:05:28.500 --> 03:05:29.400
one of those things that like


3664
03:05:30.200 --> 03:05:33.400
you have to you guys have to really realize and remember


3665
03:05:33.400 --> 03:05:35.500
that I am teaching you.


3666
03:05:36.400 --> 03:05:39.400
Like six to seven years of what I have sifted


3667
03:05:39.400 --> 03:05:42.200
through and put together in a matter of


3668
03:05:42.200 --> 03:05:45.400
a few hours and you got that's a lot. It's


3669
03:05:45.400 --> 03:05:48.000
a lot you're learning years worth of stuff.


3670
03:05:49.300 --> 03:05:52.200
In a very short amount of time and I try to give you a lot of stuff like I


3671
03:05:52.200 --> 03:05:55.000
want it to be valuable. I could have just been like, you know


3672
03:05:55.500 --> 03:05:58.200
one or two things and moved on but now I want it to be worth it


3673
03:05:58.200 --> 03:05:58.500
for you.


3674
03:05:59.300 --> 03:06:02.100
And so you're learning a lot which is great that you have


3675
03:06:02.100 --> 03:06:05.100
access to the class afterwards because you can go back and kind of


3676
03:06:05.100 --> 03:06:08.100
like teach yourself slowly and I just want you guys have the


3677
03:06:08.100 --> 03:06:09.900
right information because going through


3678
03:06:11.300 --> 03:06:14.900
The the wrong information in the wrong systems


3679
03:06:14.900 --> 03:06:17.200
in the wrong definitions and the wrong meanings of


3680
03:06:17.200 --> 03:06:20.300
aspects and whatever it's really difficult because you're


3681
03:06:20.300 --> 03:06:22.500
all you want is to know. How does it work?


3682
03:06:23.400 --> 03:06:26.100
How can astrology actually work and if I'm doing it and


3683
03:06:26.100 --> 03:06:29.100
it's Hit or Miss half time? It's okay half the time


3684
03:06:29.100 --> 03:06:31.000
it's not it makes it really difficult.


3685
03:06:32.100 --> 03:06:35.600
So I try to make it so it's like okay, you have a hundred percent and


3686
03:06:35.600 --> 03:06:38.400
then it's gonna come down to your ability to just


3687
03:06:38.400 --> 03:06:42.000
kind of use your intuition which is why Ashley's


3688
03:06:41.600 --> 03:06:44.700
psychic development class is so important using your


3689
03:06:44.700 --> 03:06:46.100
intuition to trust yourself.


3690
03:06:46.900 --> 03:06:49.400
And that's what Ashley did for me when I got into astrology


3691
03:06:49.400 --> 03:06:53.200
when she activated my third eye was when it


3692
03:06:52.200 --> 03:06:55.800
was a game changer for reading charts because


3693
03:06:55.800 --> 03:06:59.900
all of this stuff here is very mathematical


3694
03:06:58.900 --> 03:07:01.000
scientific. Whatever.


3695
03:07:01.800 --> 03:07:02.100
but


3696
03:07:03.600 --> 03:07:06.800
knowing which which version of Taurus


3697
03:07:06.800 --> 03:07:09.100
were talking about her which version of you know,


3698
03:07:09.100 --> 03:07:11.800
Chiron we're talking about or I mean kyron's pretty


3699
03:07:12.500 --> 03:07:15.500
pretty simple or the moon or knowing which aspect to


3700
03:07:15.500 --> 03:07:18.600
look at first when someone's asking a question, that's all intuition.


3701
03:07:19.400 --> 03:07:22.800
I can pick anything. There's a lot going on in this chart but using


3702
03:07:22.800 --> 03:07:25.300
your intuition to do it. That's why her class


3703
03:07:25.300 --> 03:07:26.500
I recommend so much.


3704
03:07:28.300 --> 03:07:31.500
It's an awesome balance to have your classes alternating. Yeah, and she's she's about


3705
03:07:31.500 --> 03:07:34.300
to do and we're doing not all of our classes are live. I


3706
03:07:34.300 --> 03:07:37.200
know that she's gonna be doing the minor Arcana next Sunday.


3707
03:07:38.700 --> 03:07:40.500
and it's more of an overview and like


3708
03:07:41.900 --> 03:07:44.200
understanding how it works. But she's also


3709
03:07:44.200 --> 03:07:47.700
going to do a cup swans swords and Pentacles class


3710
03:07:47.700 --> 03:07:50.200
separate because she's gonna dive so deep and


3711
03:07:50.200 --> 03:07:53.500
she actually explained a card what card was seven


3712
03:07:53.500 --> 03:07:57.000
of Swords. She explained the seven of Swords to me yesterday actually


3713
03:07:56.900 --> 03:07:59.800
in such an amazing way


3714
03:07:59.800 --> 03:08:02.500
in a unique perspective that I had never


3715
03:08:02.500 --> 03:08:05.700
because I learned tarot from Ashley. I watched other


3716
03:08:05.700 --> 03:08:08.800
Terror readers, but I actually learned from Ashley and


3717
03:08:08.800 --> 03:08:11.700
I read my own way. I don't read the way


3718
03:08:11.700 --> 03:08:14.200
that Ashley reads. I read like in a sentence because that's


3719
03:08:14.200 --> 03:08:17.200
the way that my mind works. She does a very different thing.


3720
03:08:18.200 --> 03:08:20.900
And when you know learning from her.


3721
03:08:25.200 --> 03:08:26.000
learning from her


3722
03:08:27.700 --> 03:08:30.800
like I said brought me my intuition. So my


3723
03:08:30.800 --> 03:08:33.600
intuition is what I use and I


3724
03:08:33.600 --> 03:08:36.100
don't have speaking of moon and fears. I


3725
03:08:36.100 --> 03:08:39.600
don't have any fears when I'm reading people's charts anymore because of my intuition


3726
03:08:39.600 --> 03:08:42.600
when I first started reading astrology. I had a lot of fear this


3727
03:08:42.600 --> 03:08:45.100
Moon card means makes a lot of sense here. I had


3728
03:08:45.100 --> 03:08:48.400
a lot of fear because I was afraid I there's so


3729
03:08:48.400 --> 03:08:49.700
much information. What do I say?


3730
03:08:50.400 --> 03:08:52.700
But now I don't have to worry about it. I just go.


3731
03:08:53.700 --> 03:08:56.600
I just say what I need to say and then


3732
03:08:56.600 --> 03:08:59.400
it all just works out. I'm telling you like every


3733
03:08:59.400 --> 03:09:02.600
reading just works out because I don't have to worry about stressing


3734
03:09:02.600 --> 03:09:05.100
myself. I don't have to worry about any of that. I use


3735
03:09:05.100 --> 03:09:06.400
my intuition and


3736
03:09:08.100 --> 03:09:12.100
it's one thing that you don't hear from a lot of astrologers is the integration of


3737
03:09:11.100 --> 03:09:14.300
using your intuition when you're doing chart readings, but


3738
03:09:14.300 --> 03:09:14.900
it's very important.


3739
03:09:16.300 --> 03:09:19.300
I definitely go back over the class several times and that's


3740
03:09:19.300 --> 03:09:23.100
that's the whole point. It's a lot of information. It would


3741
03:09:22.100 --> 03:09:25.800
be I'd be very surprised if you guys remembered


3742
03:09:26.500 --> 03:09:29.300
all this info like just from


3743
03:09:30.200 --> 03:09:32.100
showing up and being online here. So


3744
03:09:33.300 --> 03:09:36.400
it's damn. I answered 105 questions.


3745
03:09:36.400 --> 03:09:39.500
That's crazy. So I appreciate


3746
03:09:39.500 --> 03:09:43.100
all you thank you guys so much for taking


3747
03:09:42.100 --> 03:09:46.000
this class. I'm hoping that this illuminated aspects


3748
03:09:45.000 --> 03:09:46.300
because


3749
03:09:47.500 --> 03:09:50.200
The information I felt was a little bit difficult to find and


3750
03:09:50.200 --> 03:09:53.500
I hope this brings clarity as we start getting into the classes where


3751
03:09:53.500 --> 03:09:56.100
we pull it all together. It's gonna make a lot


3752
03:09:56.100 --> 03:10:00.200
more sense and then we'll start using examples and we'll start you know


3753
03:10:00.200 --> 03:10:03.200
doing that and then eventually getting to the manifestation which is


3754
03:10:03.200 --> 03:10:06.100
really what all this is about getting you to the point


3755
03:10:06.100 --> 03:10:09.400
where you understand the astrology and then you can say


3756
03:10:09.400 --> 03:10:12.500
Okay, I want this now. Okay. So


3757
03:10:12.500 --> 03:10:15.800
what do we want? We want this how do we make that happen? Can


3758
03:10:15.800 --> 03:10:18.800
we make it happen and then obviously separately we'll


3759
03:10:18.800 --> 03:10:22.000
have Astro cartography relocation classes. I'm


3760
03:10:21.100 --> 03:10:24.400
gonna dive deeper into certain components. Like like


3761
03:10:24.400 --> 03:10:27.700
I said the nodes and everything in the moon. I might


3762
03:10:27.700 --> 03:10:30.300
even do the luminaries. I'll probably dive deeper into the


3763
03:10:30.300 --> 03:10:34.000
angles because there's still more to talk about there and then


3764
03:10:33.100 --> 03:10:36.200
that transits class so there's just so much going on.


3765
03:10:37.400 --> 03:10:40.500
You flipping killed it Logan. Have a great night. See you


3766
03:10:40.500 --> 03:10:43.100
next class and probably live soon. Yeah be live soon.


3767
03:10:43.100 --> 03:10:46.700
Probably not tonight, or I know not tonight but soon


3768
03:10:46.700 --> 03:10:49.500
actually thank you so much Logan you're so


3769
03:10:49.500 --> 03:10:53.000
appreciate enjoying your night bacon. Yes night bacon great


3770
03:10:52.300 --> 03:10:56.100
for saturated fats, which are good for you Ashley teaches


3771
03:10:55.100 --> 03:10:58.500
that holistic healing and


3772
03:10:58.500 --> 03:11:00.800
obviously you'd have to be okay with bacon.


3773
03:11:01.600 --> 03:11:06.000
You know morality, but anyway, Danny,


3774
03:11:04.100 --> 03:11:07.300
thank you. See you next time excited. Have
