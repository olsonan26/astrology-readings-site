00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:07.300
Hey everybody. Welcome to the second course.


2
00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:11.500
We did the intro to Basics last


3
00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:14.800
time and now we're doing the interpretations. I'm sorry the foundations


4
00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:17.600
of interpretations. So this


5
00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:21.100
is just basically the the steps after


6
00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.700
learning the basics. We went through the 12 houses.


7
00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:26.500
We went through the rulership went through the planets


8
00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.200
and signs. We talked a lot about the energy we went


9
00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:32.500
through the the house systems and all that that is like the


10
00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:36.000
grounding like that's just information in my


11
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:38.600
mind. It has nothing to do with actually interpreting you


12
00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.100
need that to interpret but now we're


13
00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.500
gonna go get into some of the the fundamentals


14
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.300
the things that are going to lead us


15
00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.500
to being able to actually interpret. Now, this


16
00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:53.700
class isn't you're not gonna walk away from this class by itself


17
00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:56.200
being like Oh, I can read charts. There's still a


18
00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:56.900
few other steps and


19
00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.100
I think this entire like mini course is just gonna be


20
00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:01.800
five classes.


21
00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.300
And you will be able to read a chart


22
00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:08.500
and interpret by studying these five classes and


23
00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.800
moving forward. So this is class two of five. The next


24
00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.400
class is going to be aspects and transits.


25
00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:19.100
And it's only those two topics because those


26
00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:22.000
are the main things those are the glue to


27
00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:24.500
be able to read and once we get past this class


28
00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.500
and then aspects and transits then we're going to start going into


29
00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.500
application of actually reading a chart and


30
00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:34.100
the fifth class is going to be about manifestation


31
00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.400
with those energies meaning taking what


32
00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:39.600
you see and finding different ways different routes


33
00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.300
to actually use that energy and then move that


34
00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:42.600
forward.


35
00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.300
Because we we can read charts because


36
00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:49.500
we see how things manifest over and over things are


37
00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.500
very cyclical. Most of the energies have


38
00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.300
a default pattern a default type of energy that they


39
00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:58.800
they tend to manifest as so


40
00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.700
what we want to do is learn how that is


41
00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.300
happening and how we can break those Cycles, especially when


42
00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:07.700
it comes to certain very powerful.


43
00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.300
placements or aspects in our charts many of


44
00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.900
you have already taken the psychic development class that my wife teaches I


45
00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.400
use her knowledge her gifts


46
00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.100
that she she opened my


47
00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:25.200
third eye and while it doesn't matter as much


48
00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:25.300
for


49
00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:30.300
Learning the basics like the the fact stuff. Once


50
00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:32.800
you get into actually interpreting charts having your


51
00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.600
intuition there to guide you is very important. So


52
00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.200
if you guys haven't already done that obviously look into her


53
00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.800
her psychic development class, even if you're not learning looking


54
00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:44.800
to learn tarot, it's very good for reading astrology.


55
00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.900
And that's what I do when you guys see me recharts you


56
00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.300
see me actually bounce around and I kind of hone in


57
00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:53.600
what my intuition is telling me to hone


58
00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:54.200
into so


59
00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.100
I really don't want to waste any more time. I want to Dive Right into


60
00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:01.200
this. I do have the Q&amp;A open during it. So if


61
00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.400
anybody needs me to clarify go ahead and do that, I'm going


62
00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:07.700
to run through this just like a manuscript and


63
00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:11.000
we'll get to the end where I'll be


64
00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:13.600
talking about ruler ships. And that's that's really like


65
00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:16.100
the in my opinion. That's what


66
00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:19.000
separates my methods from others, but also kind of


67
00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:22.700
sets us up so that we can really be amped to


68
00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:25.700
start actually interpreting energy. So let's get


69
00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:28.200
through the next couple of topics so that


70
00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:32.000
we can get those finish out those Basics and get into the interpretation


71
00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.200
foundations here.


72
00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:34.500
so


73
00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:38.400
We're just going to jump in with the Angles and


74
00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.000
this is something that I wanted to get to into the basics. It's just like


75
00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:44.900
there's just so much information. So we're starting here with this


76
00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:47.300
and you'll notice here. This chart


77
00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:50.600
would be somebody who is a cancer Rising. This is the ascendant sign


78
00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:53.900
here. The four angles are the ascendant The


79
00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:57.200
Descendant the midheaven and


80
00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:58.000
the nadir.


81
00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:01.400
And they have different names, but these are the main ones


82
00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:04.700
just to make it easy for you to remember the ascendant always


83
00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:07.400
sits in the first house. Remember we


84
00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:10.400
use in our method of reading. We


85
00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:13.200
always use whole Science House system if you've


86
00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.000
looked at placidus house system.


87
00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:18.000
For example what you'll end up


88
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:18.300
seeing.


89
00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:22.400
Is that the ascendant instead


90
00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:25.200
of being in the first house floating around that it ends up


91
00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:28.200
being the first house cusp. So what I'm going to show you


92
00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:30.400
here is I'm going to switch over.


93
00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:32.400
to the chart


94
00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:36.100
and then I'm going to open up plastidis so that I can just show you


95
00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:39.400
how the angles sit differently before I tell you what the


96
00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:40.200
angles actually mean.


97
00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:41.700
So I'm going to


98
00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:46.300
this is whole signs and you'll notice I'm a Leo Rising.


99
00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:50.900
And we're gonna get into deckons in today's class and


100
00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:54.100
my ascendant sits at 13 degrees 6


101
00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:56.100
minutes, right? So this is


102
00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:57.400
where my ascendance sits.


103
00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:00.900
This is in the first house meaning this this point


104
00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:03.300
can arbitrarily and I guess not arbitrarily but


105
00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:06.500
this point can float around anywhere within


106
00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:09.700
the first house. As soon as this ascended point would reach


107
00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:12.400
Virgo then the whole chart would shift


108
00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:15.400
and then Virgo would be my ascendant. It would move up


109
00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:17.200
and then Leo would be in my 12th house.


110
00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:21.200
And you notice here that the mid Heavens at three degrees, but the


111
00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:24.700
cuspline is at zero same thing with the descendant


112
00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:27.900
now when you're using astro.com and some other software it


113
00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:30.100
only shows you the ascendant and the


114
00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:34.200
midheaven The Descendant and the IC


115
00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:35.700
are actually not shown.


116
00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:39.300
They are shown with little blue lines, but they don't


117
00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:42.400
have the text there so it can be difficult as a


118
00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:45.300
beginner. If you're not sure. The easiest way is to


119
00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:48.200
understand that these are axes. Right so you have


120
00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:51.400
your ascended descendant axis. You have your mid Heaven


121
00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:54.800
knee deer axis, whatever degree. The ascendant is


122
00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:58.000
sitting at the descent is sitting at that exact place


123
00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:00.600
because it's 180 degrees away in the


124
00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:03.300
seventh house. The Descent is always in the seventh house


125
00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:05.600
the mid Heaven can float. We'll talk about that.


126
00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:09.200
It's at three degrees which means the IC or


127
00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:12.300
the nadir is sitting down here at three degrees. And if


128
00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:15.600
you look here when I zoom in on my fourth house,


129
00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:18.100
you'll see Jupiter sitting right here. You'll see


130
00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:21.600
Zero Degrees 47 minutes for Jupiter. That's


131
00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:24.400
this blue line right here. This blue line


132
00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:28.100
has nothing written on the map. This is the IC and


133
00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:30.400
you'll look at the same thing. Here's the ascendant at


134
00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:30.800
13 degrees.


135
00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:34.300
In my seventh house. I have Vesta which is


136
00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:37.000
an asteroid. This will be we'll talk about Vesta in a


137
00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:40.500
different class. And then we have the moon. This is 25 degrees


138
00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:43.400
third twenty-three degrees. And then you see this blue dot or


139
00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:46.000
Dash or hyphen or whatever down here in the


140
00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:49.200
seventh house and this is my descendant. All right.


141
00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:52.800
So when we're looking at these four


142
00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:55.200
points, this is where they sit and the


143
00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:58.500
reason why we're talking about these four points is these are like hot wires


144
00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:02.700
Meaning that when planets access these


145
00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:05.200
points, they're felt much


146
00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:08.300
stronger than just sitting in the first house or fourth or


147
00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:11.500
seventh or tenth house and you'll notice that the mid Heaven


148
00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:14.500
does float the IC does float which means that not every


149
00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:17.600
Leo Rising is going to have the same childhood.


150
00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:20.100
It's not just the placement of the planets, but it's the


151
00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:23.200
IC meaning the childhood itself and let's just go ahead


152
00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:24.400
and jump into all that.


153
00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:28.200
Because I have it written down for you.


154
00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:33.000
Again, this PDF will be available for you after the class. I'll


155
00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:35.200
put it all together. So you have these materials as well.


156
00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:38.200
So the ascendant you see here it can


157
00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:41.600
only be in the first house. This is just a reminder for you guys that


158
00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:44.300
no matter what chart you're looking at. It will


159
00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:46.000
always be in the first house and you know what I didn't do.


160
00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:50.200
Let me jump back real quick to this. I wanted to show you


161
00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:51.100
placidus.


162
00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:55.600
This is placidus real quick. So you'll see that the ascendant


163
00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:58.900
is still at 13 degrees. Nothing actually changes except


164
00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:01.400
the houses and that's why they're called House


165
00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:04.400
systems because what changes is where


166
00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:07.400
the cusp of each house sits and we talked


167
00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:10.300
a little bit about how systems in the last class. I'm not going to go over it


168
00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:13.700
anymore. You see that it's mine's not as odd


169
00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:16.200
as some people's right. The houses are not


170
00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:16.600
as


171
00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:20.100
Different in sizes, but if you


172
00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:23.300
go to extreme higher low latitudes and other places on the


173
00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:26.300
earth, you'll see that the first second and third house are


174
00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:29.200
tiny and then the fourth and 10th house take up like half the chart.


175
00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:36.700
All right set my sound came out. Hopefully everything


176
00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:37.200
is good.


177
00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:41.100
Okay, so you'll see here that the first


178
00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:44.600
house when you zoom in on this first house here in


179
00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:47.300
placidus is sitting at 13 degrees which


180
00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:50.000
means half of my Leo actually sits in the


181
00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:53.400
12th house, even though the 12th house cusp is in


182
00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:57.300
cancer. Now, I learned on placidus and


183
00:08:56.300 --> 00:08:59.100
it took me a very long


184
00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:02.500
time to realize that I that the health system was part of the problem for


185
00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:03.800
reading accurately.


186
00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:08.200
But I did learn on this I learned all about intercepted houses,


187
00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:11.400
which I actually don't have any but my wife does when I was doing her chart.


188
00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:12.300
and


189
00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:17.100
seeing that some of these planets sit in different houses.


190
00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:19.700
So for instance my Mercury sits


191
00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:22.100
in the 11th house in whole science it sits in


192
00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:25.100
the 10th house in placidus. My Uranus is in the


193
00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:28.200
fifth house and whole signs. It's in the fourth house in placidus.


194
00:09:28.900 --> 00:09:31.900
And Jupiter is in the fourth house and


195
00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:34.800
it's in the third house in place. Now, some of these don't actually


196
00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:38.200
make that much of a difference because until


197
00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:41.200
we get into rulership and this is the key but


198
00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:43.200
because even at whole


199
00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:46.300
signs my Jupiter sits at zero degrees and we're gonna be talking about


200
00:09:46.300 --> 00:09:49.500
this today why orb of influence is so important this


201
00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:51.300
is coming up later in this


202
00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:55.500
In this class, you know, it's already affecting


203
00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:58.300
my third house. So moving it to the third house and


204
00:09:58.300 --> 00:10:01.600
putting it here right next to the cusp still affects third


205
00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:04.200
and fourth. So this particular planet


206
00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:08.300
Resonating in two different houses doesn't tell me


207
00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:11.000
that whole science or placidus is more accurate than


208
00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:15.200
the other because it kind of plays out. Similarly. There


209
00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:18.700
is a stark difference between Jupiter originating


210
00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:20.400
in the third house versus the fourth house,


211
00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:23.500
but without getting into those details one thing


212
00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:26.200
that really does pull it


213
00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:29.600
all together for me. Is that my childhood


214
00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:32.100
had a lot of video games?


215
00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:36.600
So when you look at whole signs, like video


216
00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:39.200
games were staple. I'm not joking about that. It's not just like


217
00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:42.800
I played video games. No, that was my life art and


218
00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:45.400
video games were like and martial arts though. Those three things,


219
00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:50.100
right? So the fifth House of Fun and Recreation Sagittarius


220
00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:51.900
for exploration and


221
00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:54.400
then Neptune for media and


222
00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:57.700
Uranus here for electronics technology.


223
00:10:57.700 --> 00:11:00.600
This is the video games in


224
00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:03.100
my chart when I move over to placidus,


225
00:11:04.300 --> 00:11:07.100
You'll notice and when we talk about orbs of influence, this will


226
00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:10.300
make more sense, but you'll notice that Uranus is at one degree.


227
00:11:10.300 --> 00:11:13.600
But you see how far it is away from the the cuspline


228
00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:16.700
for the fifth house in the fifth house. We have Capricorn.


229
00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:20.000
We have Sagittarius we have Neptune and


230
00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:24.100
then we have the ruler of of


231
00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:25.600
Sagittarius is Jupiter


232
00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:28.300
and that's over in the third house maybe pushing into the fourth


233
00:11:28.300 --> 00:11:31.300
house, but that's not video games. Like they would


234
00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:34.400
be a long stretch for me to include technology in this


235
00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:37.500
because I'm going to houses to get there. That would


236
00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:40.500
be like a byproduct so we can see just in my


237
00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:43.100
own chart just in video games also if we go up


238
00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:43.400
here,


239
00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:47.500
To Mercury Mercury


240
00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:50.100
in the 11th house in Gemini's thinking about


241
00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:53.700
all kinds of humanitarian things for the sake of being humanitarian.


242
00:11:54.700 --> 00:11:57.900
Here in the tenth house. It would be thinking about humanitarian


243
00:11:57.900 --> 00:12:00.600
things as a career, which I don't


244
00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:03.100
have I'm not doing things for the Public Image. I


245
00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:06.700
actually have things tied to my IC that I want to do humanitarian.


246
00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:09.800
So for me, that's two different ways immediately


247
00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:12.700
that I debunk class at this house system now, we're


248
00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:15.200
not going to talk anymore about that because we need to get


249
00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:18.900
over to this again. So the ascendant can


250
00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:20.100
only be in the first house.


251
00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:24.300
What it is is the point the exact point in


252
00:12:24.300 --> 00:12:27.600
a constellation that was coming up on the Eastern Horizon


253
00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:29.400
the moment you took your first breath.


254
00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:32.600
So when we go back to my chart.


255
00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:36.200
In whole signs 13 degrees was the


256
00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:39.300
horizon line. And that was at 13


257
00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:42.500
degrees. Basically the middle of Leo Leo was


258
00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:46.100
coming up over the Eastern Horizon and therefore creates


259
00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:48.300
my sunrise and then over here is


260
00:12:48.300 --> 00:12:51.800
my sun set but this is at the


261
00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:54.100
time I was born this is what was coming up at the time.


262
00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:59.600
What it has to do with is physical body and appearance.


263
00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:02.400
Now, the first house is the house of self. So when


264
00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:05.300
we're talking about the first house, we're always talking


265
00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:08.200
about your physical appearance. How you dress? How you


266
00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:13.400
how you look towards the world how you do things like your your initial


267
00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:16.200
reactions that we discussed in the first class, but this


268
00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:19.400
is specific to the physical body and how you


269
00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:22.600
dress specifically and when we get into deckons, it's


270
00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:25.300
gonna make a lot more sense, but Minds that 13 degrees,


271
00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:28.500
which is in the second deck in here. So a Jupiter vibe


272
00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:30.100
to my Leo Rising


273
00:13:31.300 --> 00:13:34.700
and this has to do with your physical presence on a


274
00:13:35.900 --> 00:13:38.400
Earthly Soul level which is different


275
00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:39.800
than the moon soul level.


276
00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:43.700
And a lot of people a lot of astrologers a


277
00:13:43.700 --> 00:13:46.600
lot of you know resources books whatnot. They separate out


278
00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:49.200
the Moon is the only indication of the


279
00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:52.400
soul, but I actually see it as the moon the nodes the


280
00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:55.300
ascendant the IC it all kind


281
00:13:55.300 --> 00:13:58.600
of culminates it comes together. I don't think your soul is split into one planet.


282
00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:02.400
But in terms of how you outwardly present yourself who you are


283
00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:05.400
in this world is the ascendant the first house is


284
00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:09.400
the house of self. But what happens to you directly is


285
00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:10.200
the ascendant.


286
00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:14.700
It's also your self-awareness and first impressions again, when


287
00:14:14.700 --> 00:14:17.700
we get to deckons a lot of this is going to make a lot more sense, but


288
00:14:17.700 --> 00:14:20.300
self-awareness and first impressions. It's literally


289
00:14:20.300 --> 00:14:23.400
how you react to things and that couples with


290
00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:26.500
the first house ruler couples with Mars. They


291
00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:29.400
couples with the moon even once you start processing things


292
00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:32.600
emotionally, but the immediate gut knee-jerk reactions


293
00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:35.800
how you approach the world. Your foundation is


294
00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:38.500
the ascendant. So this is extremely important


295
00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:41.200
and a lot of people don't give the ascended a


296
00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:44.800
lot of credit what you hear all the time is that the ascendant is the mask


297
00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:47.300
you wear that could be the that couldn't


298
00:14:47.300 --> 00:14:50.400
be further from the truth. It has


299
00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:54.200
nothing to do with the mask. It literally is you and


300
00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:56.100
the ascendant in The Descendant have to do


301
00:14:56.100 --> 00:14:59.400
with how you are versus how you act with other people how


302
00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:02.300
you relate to other people. So when we get to the descendent again, it's


303
00:15:02.300 --> 00:15:05.600
the exact opposite because it's the same axis. It can


304
00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:08.700
only be stationed in the seventh


305
00:15:08.700 --> 00:15:08.800
house.


306
00:15:10.300 --> 00:15:13.500
And it's how you handle direct one to


307
00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:16.700
one influence. It's your relationship with other


308
00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:19.400
people. How other people impact you when you


309
00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:23.100
are not engaging with people. This


310
00:15:22.100 --> 00:15:25.700
is what people see you as


311
00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:29.200
And what's weird is they always say is the ascendant that


312
00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:32.400
they see you as but that's not true. This is what they


313
00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:35.400
see you as here when you're not engaging so when you're sitting


314
00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:39.000
in a room and you're doing absolutely nothing and


315
00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:41.500
someone sees you it's your descended that


316
00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:44.500
they're seeing and The Descendants ruler and


317
00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:47.400
a few other things, but this is the main thing. So for me


318
00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:50.200
people see me as an aquarius not looking


319
00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:52.400
at my visuals just looking at how I act.


320
00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:56.700
In in conversation from


321
00:15:56.700 --> 00:15:59.800
the outside and it's how I handle those things. The


322
00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:02.300
ascendant is how I react. So


323
00:16:02.300 --> 00:16:05.400
when I'm engaging in something when I'm putting my


324
00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:08.900
effort into something people will see your ascendant


325
00:16:08.900 --> 00:16:12.200
now, obviously there are certain planetary


326
00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:14.500
placements that will kind of mask this


327
00:16:14.500 --> 00:16:17.600
meaning if you're ascendant ruler is in


328
00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:20.600
the 12th house or the Eighth House. It could be that it's


329
00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:23.500
hard for you to be seen or that you intentionally hide your


330
00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:26.900
true self. But without that like deeper level


331
00:16:26.900 --> 00:16:29.800
the basics the foundation the umbrella it


332
00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:32.600
is your engagement and when you're not engaged


333
00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:34.700
and only doing like


334
00:16:35.500 --> 00:16:38.200
Minimal one to one here. It also


335
00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:41.100
has to do with your compatibility basis when you're talking about


336
00:16:41.100 --> 00:16:45.000
the people and the types of individuals the


337
00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:47.300
grounding the foundation for the type of


338
00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:50.300
relationship that you need and the type of people you need


339
00:16:50.300 --> 00:16:53.400
in your life. If you're a Leo Rising for instance that


340
00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:56.900
has an aquarius seventh house. You need friendship. If


341
00:16:56.900 --> 00:16:59.100
you are a libraizing you have Aries, you need


342
00:16:59.100 --> 00:17:02.300
a little bit of competition. If you're Sagittarius you have Gemini


343
00:17:02.300 --> 00:17:04.100
you need somebody who will communicate with you.


344
00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:07.700
That's How The Descendant plays out and then obviously again


345
00:17:07.700 --> 00:17:10.400
if it's Gemini you'll look for mercury you'll see how that plays


346
00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:11.600
out and it also


347
00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:16.600
It will also give you the seventh house ruler will


348
00:17:16.600 --> 00:17:19.800
give you the conditions for


349
00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:22.200
which you get married because the seventh house


350
00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:25.300
is also the house of relationships in marriage. So


351
00:17:25.300 --> 00:17:27.800
where The Descendants sits will also tell you that as well.


352
00:17:28.900 --> 00:17:32.000
And then they're unrealized Shadow qualities.


353
00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:34.300
These are things about yourself that you don't


354
00:17:34.300 --> 00:17:37.300
see you. Don't see for instance. Leo risings


355
00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:39.400
tend not to see how


356
00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:43.300
Good of a friend they can be but also how


357
00:17:43.300 --> 00:17:46.500
detached they can be a Pisces Rising doesn't


358
00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:49.100
notice how much they give in terms


359
00:17:49.100 --> 00:17:52.300
of service to others, but they also sometimes don't realize how


360
00:17:52.300 --> 00:17:53.900
critical they are of other people.


361
00:17:54.700 --> 00:17:57.000
And you can go around the entire zodiac there. You can


362
00:17:57.200 --> 00:18:00.400
find the positives and the negatives the pros and cons you can weigh that out. But


363
00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:03.200
the ascendant and The Descendant are those specific points in


364
00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:03.600
the chart.


365
00:18:04.900 --> 00:18:07.700
That sit here opposite from each other first and


366
00:18:07.700 --> 00:18:10.100
seventh house that will guide you


367
00:18:10.100 --> 00:18:13.200
on understanding exactly how it is


368
00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:16.400
you work with other people and then you bring in the ruler


369
00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:17.600
ships in the aspects to it from there.


370
00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:21.800
All right, so


371
00:18:25.300 --> 00:18:28.400
Now we're moving on to the IC and the mid habit. Now the icing


372
00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:31.400
in the mid Haven in placidus is always the


373
00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:34.600
start the IC is always the start of the fourth


374
00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:37.200
house and the MC is always the start


375
00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:40.600
of the tenth house. So in placidus the mid Haven


376
00:18:40.600 --> 00:18:43.300
always means the same thing as your tenth house


377
00:18:43.300 --> 00:18:47.300
meaning career reputation and so on but in whole


378
00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:49.100
science health system in the way that I interpret it.


379
00:18:49.100 --> 00:18:52.600
It is a Soul's outward projection meaning that


380
00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:55.300
your 10th house rules your career the type


381
00:18:55.300 --> 00:18:58.100
of jobs that you have but the mid Heaven is the essence of who you


382
00:18:58.100 --> 00:19:01.700
have to be in that career. It is everything you want to project to


383
00:19:01.700 --> 00:19:04.600
get away from your childhood to bring in balance from


384
00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:07.100
what you experience as a child to what you need


385
00:19:07.100 --> 00:19:10.400
to experience in in your career in


386
00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:11.500
your life purpose.


387
00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:17.300
So Taylor's asking what does it mean if they


388
00:19:17.300 --> 00:19:21.300
ruler of a house sits in that house? So for


389
00:19:20.300 --> 00:19:23.100
instance, if you have the seventh house


390
00:19:23.100 --> 00:19:26.400
here ruleship, which obviously we're gonna get to rulership


391
00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:29.300
a little bit later, but the ruler of the house


392
00:19:29.300 --> 00:19:31.100
sitting in the same house means that


393
00:19:33.300 --> 00:19:36.900
The focus is put back on on the


394
00:19:36.900 --> 00:19:39.400
theme. So if you are if you're a


395
00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:42.300
Capricorn rising, I'm sorry, if you're cancer rising and you


396
00:19:42.300 --> 00:19:45.500
have a Capricorn descendant and Saturn sits in the seventh


397
00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:48.400
house. That means that you're you're


398
00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:52.000
life goals are attributed back to having a


399
00:19:51.300 --> 00:19:54.600
relationship or working with other people or having authority


400
00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:58.600
over one to one relationships and one to one interactions. It


401
00:19:57.600 --> 00:20:00.300
just means that it's not bringing any other area


402
00:20:00.300 --> 00:20:04.000
of your life into Focus. It's kind of a compartmentalization


403
00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:06.300
until you bring aspects into it. It's a


404
00:20:06.300 --> 00:20:09.000
compartmentalization of that energy same thing with


405
00:20:09.100 --> 00:20:12.400
the 10th house Aries in the tenth


406
00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:15.100
house Mars being in the 10th house in Aries means that


407
00:20:15.100 --> 00:20:18.200
your focus is back on climbing the


408
00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:21.700
corporate ladder and it's all everything has to do with how


409
00:20:21.700 --> 00:20:24.900
you can achieve those goals specifically there.


410
00:20:24.900 --> 00:20:27.300
You're not bringing in children. You're not bringing if it


411
00:20:27.300 --> 00:20:30.200
were the fifth house. You're not bringing creativity from the 12th house.


412
00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:32.800
You're not bringing in communication from the


413
00:20:32.900 --> 00:20:35.400
Third house. It is strictly. I'm here I


414
00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:38.100
have work to do I've got goals and I'm going to climb those


415
00:20:38.100 --> 00:20:41.100
goals in anything that I have to do. I'm going to do I'm going


416
00:20:41.100 --> 00:20:42.300
to push forward to do that.


417
00:20:43.900 --> 00:20:46.200
So the ruler in its own house just


418
00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:49.300
means that the themes of that house are put back into the


419
00:20:49.300 --> 00:20:49.800
same house.


420
00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:54.500
It's I've seen some websites overcome over. Yes over


421
00:20:54.500 --> 00:20:57.400
complicate that it shouldn't be


422
00:20:57.400 --> 00:21:00.200
it shouldn't be that complicated and this is part of why


423
00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:03.200
I'm teaching this right is to make it not complicated.


424
00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:08.800
Yeah, so let's move on to the IC.


425
00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:11.200
So again the IC sits down


426
00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:14.400
here in my example that I created here. I put the mid


427
00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:17.200
heaven in the ninth house and the IC in the third


428
00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:20.300
house to just to illustrate the fact that it does


429
00:21:20.300 --> 00:21:23.400
not have to be the 10th and the fourth house. Although you will see it there often.


430
00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:27.900
So when we go back here the IC is the mm Cole.


431
00:21:27.900 --> 00:21:30.200
I'm sure I'm not saying that right but it's


432
00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:33.400
the Nay deer right? It's the southernmost point it literally


433
00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:37.300
translates to bottom of the sky whereas medium


434
00:21:36.300 --> 00:21:40.100
quality or mid-heaven translates to middle of


435
00:21:39.100 --> 00:21:42.300
the sky, which is not the highest point.


436
00:21:42.300 --> 00:21:43.500
That would be the zenith.


437
00:21:44.900 --> 00:21:47.200
So Melissa is asking if the Mint Heaven can


438
00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:50.100
be in the 11th house absolutely. So when we get


439
00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:53.100
here in a second, I see can be in


440
00:21:53.100 --> 00:21:56.100
the third fourth or fifth house the mid Heaven can be in the


441
00:21:56.100 --> 00:21:59.100
ninth tenth or 11th house in whole science health system.


442
00:21:59.100 --> 00:22:02.700
And the reason why I mean aside from its accuracy, the


443
00:22:02.700 --> 00:22:05.600
reason why I really like whole signs


444
00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:08.800
is because your midheaven is


445
00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:11.900
not relegated to being directly career


446
00:22:11.900 --> 00:22:14.600
oriented. Meaning your outward purpose


447
00:22:14.600 --> 00:22:17.600
might not be to have a nine-to-five job or might


448
00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:20.500
not be to climb a corporate ladder or have fame or


449
00:22:20.500 --> 00:22:23.200
have notoriety or a positive Public Image or


450
00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:26.500
anything like that your outward expression in this lifetime


451
00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:30.200
may have to do with just networking and doing humanitarian


452
00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:32.600
efforts or working with groups. That would


453
00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:35.400
be the 11th house or it might have to do with your opinion


454
00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:38.700
and where you fit in the world and how you see things differently


455
00:22:38.700 --> 00:22:41.400
which would be your ninth house how your philosophy


456
00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:44.300
doesn't match other people so you kind of have to do things your way.


457
00:22:45.500 --> 00:22:46.600
When we go back to the IC.


458
00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:50.400
I'm gonna say this out of order, but the main thing that


459
00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:53.900
I look for in the IC is your childhood environment. It


460
00:22:53.900 --> 00:22:56.400
describes your childhood. Your IC is


461
00:22:56.400 --> 00:22:59.100
the point that anything that's on it


462
00:22:59.100 --> 00:23:02.500
will describe the most influential impactful types


463
00:23:02.500 --> 00:23:05.400
of energies that surrounded how you grew up especially


464
00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:08.000
in your first five to six issues of your life


465
00:23:08.600 --> 00:23:11.500
and it extends beyond that but it's the reason


466
00:23:11.500 --> 00:23:14.100
why I focus on it so much is because it's you know


467
00:23:14.100 --> 00:23:15.200
in the real world you're


468
00:23:17.100 --> 00:23:20.900
What is it synapses or whatever it is? You're this is


469
00:23:20.900 --> 00:23:23.200
where I need my wife just to give me the clinical version of


470
00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:26.400
it. But basically you don't have memories or many


471
00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:29.700
memories prior to five because your brain isn't formulated. It


472
00:23:29.700 --> 00:23:32.800
didn't click on yet. So you're kind of on not


473
00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:35.100
autopilot because you're still controlling it but you're not


474
00:23:35.100 --> 00:23:38.000
to the point where you know, your memory is set in


475
00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:41.600
and everything is ready to go you're cognition is not at full blast.


476
00:23:42.500 --> 00:23:46.000
So I pay attention to the things that you might not know about


477
00:23:45.300 --> 00:23:48.200
your childhood, which are expressed through the


478
00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:51.600
IC your innermost feelings and privacy things


479
00:23:51.600 --> 00:23:54.100
that you do not share with other people and this is a little


480
00:23:54.100 --> 00:23:55.500
bit different than the Eighth House.


481
00:23:56.400 --> 00:23:59.500
It's more about things that are private to you things that


482
00:23:59.500 --> 00:23:59.900
are like


483
00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:04.600
It's it's not that they need to be secret. It's that


484
00:24:04.600 --> 00:24:07.400
you know, there's unless someone really knows


485
00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:10.200
you and maybe even family might know you


486
00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:13.300
if the IC is in the fourth house, but if the eye sees in the third or


487
00:24:13.300 --> 00:24:16.600
fifth house, these are things from your childhood that


488
00:24:16.600 --> 00:24:19.200
either you did you acted you're just things


489
00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:22.400
you don't put out there on display and you can


490
00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:25.100
use these things toward your mid Heaven you


491
00:24:25.100 --> 00:24:27.900
can use these things toward your career whenever you want.


492
00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:31.700
And it's the access to your deep emotional


493
00:24:31.700 --> 00:24:34.700
self. We're talking about some serious cancer type


494
00:24:34.700 --> 00:24:37.500
Vibes Moon type Vibes, but it's really how


495
00:24:37.500 --> 00:24:41.600
you connect to repressed memories lineage your


496
00:24:40.600 --> 00:24:43.900
ancestry familial Roots.


497
00:24:43.900 --> 00:24:46.500
That's all tied into your IC. It's


498
00:24:46.500 --> 00:24:49.200
literally where you came from and if anyone does any sort


499
00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:49.600
of like


500
00:24:51.100 --> 00:24:54.200
akashic records or past life readings or anything


501
00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:57.100
like that. They use the IC along with the moon to kind of


502
00:24:57.100 --> 00:25:00.700
and sometimes the South node to pull all that together so that


503
00:25:00.700 --> 00:25:03.400
they can derive where you came from what type of


504
00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:06.600
energy you had prior to this lifetime. Obviously, you'd


505
00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:09.200
have to subscribe to that. But that that's what it's based off


506
00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:12.000
of is the IC now the IC in the


507
00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:15.800
third house has to do more with Communications in early


508
00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:18.200
childhood and your relationships with your siblings or


509
00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:21.500
cousins. Your fourth house is more about you know, how you


510
00:25:22.500 --> 00:25:25.700
Related to your family your mother and your physical


511
00:25:25.700 --> 00:25:28.500
home. And then the fifth house is more about your


512
00:25:28.500 --> 00:25:32.800
creativity your creative expression. It's a


513
00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:35.300
different element of your childhood and


514
00:25:35.300 --> 00:25:38.200
Recreation, but a lot of it


515
00:25:38.200 --> 00:25:39.500
has to do with creativity.


516
00:25:41.500 --> 00:25:44.400
The fit the midheaven here. We already


517
00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:47.500
went over. This is the outward expression of internalized energy.


518
00:25:47.500 --> 00:25:50.400
So again, this is the opposite of the IC the


519
00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:53.200
ICS everything you keep private the MCS everything


520
00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:56.300
you put out there. So some people say that they can see


521
00:25:56.300 --> 00:25:58.200
you as your mid have in placement.


522
00:25:58.900 --> 00:25:59.100
and


523
00:26:00.500 --> 00:26:03.200
I don't know that I personally subscribe to that but it


524
00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:06.300
is the type of vibe that you give off in the workplace.


525
00:26:10.300 --> 00:26:13.200
Yeah, I was thinking about going back to my chart. I will so for me.


526
00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:16.800
My midheaven is in Taurus chiron's there and Venus


527
00:26:16.800 --> 00:26:19.100
is there so all about public reputation. This is


528
00:26:19.100 --> 00:26:22.200
kind of how this is how people see you in terms of the


529
00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:25.500
public. This is your Public Image. This is how you the seventh


530
00:26:25.500 --> 00:26:28.000
house is how you deal with the public but the 10th house


531
00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:31.500
is your reputation. So this is how they see you as a


532
00:26:31.500 --> 00:26:34.700
person not how they see how you act not how


533
00:26:34.700 --> 00:26:37.500
they see how you deal with other people but like their overall


534
00:26:37.500 --> 00:26:39.400
impression has to do with this.


535
00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:44.100
Your life purpose and career Direction already kind of


536
00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:47.300
explained that career directions specifically because it's


537
00:26:47.300 --> 00:26:50.500
that outward. It's what you want to put out in the world. So sometimes some


538
00:26:50.500 --> 00:26:53.200
people say that they're doing XYZ for


539
00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:56.500
their career and then I look at their midheaven and a few other factors


540
00:26:56.500 --> 00:26:57.900
and I'm like really like


541
00:26:58.700 --> 00:27:01.400
it's not that often that people are that far


542
00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:04.100
off of it, but there's a lot of people who ignore their sun sign and their


543
00:27:04.100 --> 00:27:07.500
midheaven and those are extremely important one is happiness and


544
00:27:07.500 --> 00:27:08.700
one is how it expression.


545
00:27:09.900 --> 00:27:12.300
Um, so I use that to kind


546
00:27:12.300 --> 00:27:15.300
of gauge what you'll be happiest in and the themes of


547
00:27:15.300 --> 00:27:18.500
how you have to make that energy work your tenth


548
00:27:18.500 --> 00:27:21.800
house tells me the field you'll be in but the mid Heaven


549
00:27:21.800 --> 00:27:24.300
tells me the themes of how you're going to do that how you're going


550
00:27:24.300 --> 00:27:26.700
to attain that career and what's important there?


551
00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:32.700
If there are no Angie's asking if there are no other planets in


552
00:27:32.700 --> 00:27:35.000
house with the midheaven, what are you


553
00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:38.200
reference? So that's where you get into rulership's and then you take a


554
00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:41.300
look at where the ruler is placed in any aspects to that so we will


555
00:27:41.300 --> 00:27:45.100
be doing that a little bit later. Hmm


556
00:27:44.100 --> 00:27:48.000
But for instance for that doesn't


557
00:27:47.100 --> 00:27:51.200
work on my chart but let's say my mid


558
00:27:50.200 --> 00:27:53.100
Heavens here and the rulers in the 10th house. So this


559
00:27:53.100 --> 00:27:57.500
is the question that was asked earlier is is it


560
00:27:56.500 --> 00:27:59.600
happens in my chart? But if


561
00:27:59.600 --> 00:28:02.100
the mid Haven like for instance right now where I am?


562
00:28:03.100 --> 00:28:06.400
The mid heaven in my relocated chart all this stays the


563
00:28:06.400 --> 00:28:09.500
same but my mid Heavens actually sitting here like 27 degrees Aries.


564
00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:13.300
At that point there's nothing other part of Fortunes


565
00:28:13.300 --> 00:28:16.100
there but nothing else is in and the part of Fortune will be


566
00:28:16.100 --> 00:28:19.700
another class. By the way, when we do asteroids and Arabic Parts,


567
00:28:19.700 --> 00:28:22.100
but nothing else is in here.


568
00:28:22.100 --> 00:28:25.300
There's no planets. So I would look to Mars because it rules Aries. So


569
00:28:25.300 --> 00:28:28.400
I would come down here and understand that I have


570
00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:31.900
a lot going on because I've got Mars Mars's


571
00:28:31.900 --> 00:28:34.200
connected to Mercury and


572
00:28:34.200 --> 00:28:38.100
Uranus in my chart. It's a try and in opposition Saturn


573
00:28:37.100 --> 00:28:41.600
has an in conjunction to my Venus, which


574
00:28:40.600 --> 00:28:43.100
is also it's ruler and it's also


575
00:28:43.100 --> 00:28:47.100
the ruler of the 10th house, which is interesting and then Pluto is


576
00:28:46.100 --> 00:28:49.000
sitting here and that is part of


577
00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:52.400
my kite, which is the Sun Moon Pluto and


578
00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:55.700
then Neptune which sits over here. So and then


579
00:28:55.700 --> 00:28:58.300
that brings in Jupiter this brings in that and


580
00:28:58.300 --> 00:29:01.000
then this brings in Mercury sitting in


581
00:29:01.100 --> 00:29:04.700
the same house. So for my relocated chart it brings


582
00:29:04.700 --> 00:29:07.300
in a lot of things which is why the most


583
00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:12.500
Successful, I've been on a positive transformative


584
00:29:11.500 --> 00:29:13.900
level is where I live now.


585
00:29:14.600 --> 00:29:17.500
And I used Astro cartography to get here. And again


586
00:29:17.500 --> 00:29:21.300
that'll be another class. This astrology goes ridiculously


587
00:29:20.300 --> 00:29:23.400
deep and there's so many tools when it's


588
00:29:23.400 --> 00:29:24.400
used right.


589
00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:28.500
But anyway, that's how you would do it. So everything, you know


590
00:29:28.500 --> 00:29:32.100
involved in my ninth house midheaven brings in


591
00:29:31.100 --> 00:29:34.000
the third house and then everything else through linking.


592
00:29:34.900 --> 00:29:37.800
And also like I talked about this but your


593
00:29:37.800 --> 00:29:40.500
social standing in reputation. That is the point the mid


594
00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:43.200
Heaven is the point of how people see you and


595
00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:44.400
how your reputation goes.


596
00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:45.800
so


597
00:29:46.600 --> 00:29:49.000
very interesting energy there. So I'm going to


598
00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:52.300
go into retrograde planets now and I


599
00:29:52.300 --> 00:29:55.500
I threw this in here because I just feel like nobody ever talks


600
00:29:55.500 --> 00:29:55.800
about it.


601
00:29:56.500 --> 00:29:56.700
and


602
00:29:57.900 --> 00:30:01.000
people constantly talk about I don't


603
00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:04.600
want you reading that yet people constantly talk about how bad retrogrades are


604
00:30:04.600 --> 00:30:07.600
and if you've seen my videos then you


605
00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:11.500
know that I'm a big fan of retrogrades because it presents


606
00:30:11.500 --> 00:30:14.200
opportunities to not be going full steam in the


607
00:30:14.200 --> 00:30:17.500
energy of whatever Planet we're talking about and to


608
00:30:17.500 --> 00:30:20.600
actually stop and pause and redirect your


609
00:30:20.600 --> 00:30:23.200
energy and it makes sure the a your life


610
00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:26.200
is not monotonous but be that you're not going down a path


611
00:30:26.200 --> 00:30:29.600
that's gonna lead to nothingness, especially when Saturn's retrograde


612
00:30:29.600 --> 00:30:32.500
because Saturn's like hey, you know, take a deep dive


613
00:30:32.500 --> 00:30:34.600
and look inside. What are you doing?


614
00:30:35.400 --> 00:30:38.100
To make sure that you are doing the things you need


615
00:30:38.100 --> 00:30:40.200
to do and you always hear about.


616
00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:44.100
Retrogrades in terms of aspects right? And that's what I'm talking about


617
00:30:44.100 --> 00:30:48.200
right now is Saturn's going retrograde Mercury


618
00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:50.400
is going retrograde which literally just says anything


619
00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:53.300
that has to do with Mercury type stuff service to others


620
00:30:53.300 --> 00:30:56.700
can't Communications contracts anything that's


621
00:30:56.700 --> 00:31:00.000
involving that to like take a second and because


622
00:30:59.200 --> 00:31:03.200
it rules Virgo go look at at the


623
00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:05.400
details and go make sure that everything is the


624
00:31:05.400 --> 00:31:08.500
way you want it to be and if there's anything wrong fix it


625
00:31:08.500 --> 00:31:11.400
because it's not that mercury is


626
00:31:11.400 --> 00:31:14.400
making those things happen. Although it does


627
00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:17.300
it does make those things happen, but it presents opportunities I


628
00:31:17.300 --> 00:31:18.000
buy things.


629
00:31:19.100 --> 00:31:21.200
Mercury retrograde actually the television


630
00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:25.100
That you see in some of my videos 85 inch TV that's out there


631
00:31:25.100 --> 00:31:28.200
a lot of money and it wasn't on sale when I


632
00:31:28.200 --> 00:31:31.400
bought it, but I wanted the TV and then I realized there's a


633
00:31:31.400 --> 00:31:34.400
Mercury retrograde coming up. So I walked right back into Best


634
00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:37.600
Buy. I drove my butt over there parked walked right


635
00:31:37.600 --> 00:31:40.400
back in there walked over and said I knew it the thing


636
00:31:40.400 --> 00:31:43.300
was like $700 off. So I went right over to customer


637
00:31:43.300 --> 00:31:46.500
service. I said, hey this TV, I just bought like two


638
00:31:46.500 --> 00:31:49.000
weeks ago is now seven or eight hundred dollars


639
00:31:49.300 --> 00:31:52.500
off and they just said, okay and they gave me my money back. But if


640
00:31:52.500 --> 00:31:55.000
I didn't pay attention to Mercury retrograde and I just thought they were


641
00:31:55.500 --> 00:31:58.100
bad things then I wouldn't have done that because I


642
00:31:58.100 --> 00:32:01.900
wouldn't have known that mercury retrogrades can be positive the last


643
00:32:01.900 --> 00:32:05.100
car we bought we negotiated like I


644
00:32:04.100 --> 00:32:08.500
don't remember how much thousands of dollars off and


645
00:32:07.500 --> 00:32:09.500
it was a lease.


646
00:32:10.400 --> 00:32:14.200
You know, you can do so many things with a


647
00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:15.500
Mercury retrograde now again.


648
00:32:16.600 --> 00:32:19.300
That has to do with the transits people talk about


649
00:32:19.300 --> 00:32:22.300
transits all the time. What they don't talk about is what happens


650
00:32:22.300 --> 00:32:26.500
when you're born with a retrograde and it's so


651
00:32:26.500 --> 00:32:28.400
hard to find a lot of information on this.


652
00:32:29.700 --> 00:32:32.400
Hold on Taylor's asking so monthly forecasts are


653
00:32:32.400 --> 00:32:35.700
for specific rising signs are not accurate because it


654
00:32:35.700 --> 00:32:38.200
doesn't take into account your own chart and ruler shifts and aspects no


655
00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:42.000
shade to those videos. I'm generally genuinely wondering laugh out


656
00:32:41.100 --> 00:32:44.200
loud, correct. So what you want


657
00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:47.500
to do what sometimes I'll do forecast videos, right


658
00:32:47.500 --> 00:32:50.500
and I'll talk about I haven't broken them


659
00:32:50.500 --> 00:32:53.200
down into science, but I could because I could talk about the area of life


660
00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:56.400
that it would be impacted, but you have to realize that it's a generalization.


661
00:32:57.300 --> 00:33:00.300
and it may or may not impact you it'll always


662
00:33:01.500 --> 00:33:04.200
kind of come up because we're talking about certain areas of


663
00:33:04.200 --> 00:33:08.000
life. So if we're talking about the transit energies here and we're


664
00:33:07.100 --> 00:33:10.000
talking about, you know, Mercury's here. The sun's here


665
00:33:10.800 --> 00:33:13.500
Pluto's here Saturn and Jupiter are doing this with each


666
00:33:13.500 --> 00:33:15.300
other, you know creating this type of aspect.


667
00:33:16.300 --> 00:33:19.300
And then we talk about what area of life based off. If


668
00:33:19.300 --> 00:33:22.200
you're a Virgo Rising. It'll be in your sixth house.


669
00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:25.100
If you're a you know cancer Rising it'll be over in another


670
00:33:25.100 --> 00:33:25.300
house.


671
00:33:26.500 --> 00:33:29.400
Those are thematic. They're not specific to you.


672
00:33:29.400 --> 00:33:32.400
So while if they're done properly, they're not wrong. They're


673
00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:35.600
not bad. They're just not personalized and that's the trouble


674
00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:38.600
I always have with horoscopes is that people think that because of


675
00:33:38.600 --> 00:33:41.200
horoscope says something and sometimes they'll make


676
00:33:41.200 --> 00:33:43.200
that horoscope sound extremely specific.


677
00:33:44.200 --> 00:33:47.600
And I don't know why they do that because it's not it has


678
00:33:47.600 --> 00:33:50.400
to be generalized because if you don't have a planet sitting there


679
00:33:50.400 --> 00:33:53.400
or what if you have a stellium sitting there it's going to be completely different


680
00:33:53.400 --> 00:33:54.700
on how it plays out. So


681
00:33:55.500 --> 00:33:58.600
Yeah, no shade to people who do those who do those accurately


682
00:33:58.600 --> 00:34:01.200
but they're not personalized and this is why you want


683
00:34:01.200 --> 00:34:04.400
to learn astrology for yourself because if I switch back over


684
00:34:04.400 --> 00:34:04.600
here.


685
00:34:05.800 --> 00:34:08.700
And I go to the Chart selection. I


686
00:34:08.700 --> 00:34:10.500
just make sure we're talking so tomorrow.


687
00:34:11.800 --> 00:34:13.700
Might actually be now.


688
00:34:14.800 --> 00:34:17.400
If I hit transits, by the way, you can always go


689
00:34:17.400 --> 00:34:20.400
to horoscopes on astro.com and go


690
00:34:20.400 --> 00:34:23.800
to current planets and it will pull up everything accurately. So


691
00:34:23.800 --> 00:34:26.300
you don't have to worry about if these like, especially the


692
00:34:26.300 --> 00:34:29.100
moon because the moon moves so quickly if you're not sure if this


693
00:34:29.100 --> 00:34:32.400
is sitting like right now or if it's tomorrow's energy


694
00:34:32.400 --> 00:34:34.700
or whatever you can look at current planets.


695
00:34:35.500 --> 00:34:38.900
And you can see that the Moon is sitting at 25 degrees and


696
00:34:38.900 --> 00:34:41.900
you want to know the funny thing is 25 degrees


697
00:34:41.900 --> 00:34:44.300
is right here


698
00:34:44.300 --> 00:34:47.600
on my Chiron, right? And I


699
00:34:47.600 --> 00:34:50.600
knew that this would be you know a thing


700
00:34:50.600 --> 00:34:53.600
for this class, but it doesn't really


701
00:34:53.600 --> 00:34:56.400
bother me because I'm using it as healing and I'm using


702
00:34:56.400 --> 00:34:59.700
this healing aspect because I know that I


703
00:34:59.700 --> 00:35:02.400
can give you guys a lot of information that you


704
00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:05.000
can use to make really, you know,


705
00:35:05.600 --> 00:35:09.300
amazing lives for yourself. Obviously, you need to put in real world energy


706
00:35:08.300 --> 00:35:10.700
and discipline and whatnot. But


707
00:35:11.400 --> 00:35:14.300
Knowing these energies is extremely important. You'll notice I have


708
00:35:14.300 --> 00:35:17.700
Uranus over my Venus, you know, as I have the moon


709
00:35:17.700 --> 00:35:20.700
directly right this instant over my Chiron.


710
00:35:21.300 --> 00:35:25.000
And just understanding those energies are important. But if


711
00:35:24.100 --> 00:35:27.400
we just talked about the moon in in Taurus or


712
00:35:27.400 --> 00:35:28.500
the moon in the 10th house.


713
00:35:29.500 --> 00:35:29.800
then


714
00:35:30.900 --> 00:35:33.600
Chiron wouldn't even be a thought because


715
00:35:33.600 --> 00:35:36.000
if I didn't know that I had Chiron right where the Moon


716
00:35:36.300 --> 00:35:40.200
is. I wouldn't know that this was this would be activating a


717
00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:42.700
semi-sex style. Actually, I


718
00:35:42.700 --> 00:35:46.000
wouldn't count as semi-sex top, but I would count a queen kunk's


719
00:35:45.300 --> 00:35:49.600
over here to both Pluto and Neptune this


720
00:35:49.600 --> 00:35:51.600
actually activating my yard right now.


721
00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:54.000
Which is extremely interesting, I think.


722
00:35:54.900 --> 00:35:56.900
Do aspects to your Chiron effect.


723
00:35:58.100 --> 00:35:59.500
The moon trans over it. Yes.


724
00:36:00.400 --> 00:36:04.100
And that's what we're going to talk about in another class. But yes, you


725
00:36:03.100 --> 00:36:06.300
know and that's my biggest issue with the apps.


726
00:36:07.400 --> 00:36:07.900
by the way


727
00:36:08.700 --> 00:36:12.300
The apps will tell you they are personalized


728
00:36:11.300 --> 00:36:14.900
right and they'll say oh moon half of


729
00:36:14.900 --> 00:36:17.500
them don't even talk about Chiron but let's say they did Moon over


730
00:36:17.500 --> 00:36:20.400
your Chiron means this and then you move on


731
00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:24.600
but the problem is again the moon going over


732
00:36:24.600 --> 00:36:27.400
my Chiron means Chiron is creating a square to


733
00:36:27.400 --> 00:36:30.600
my moon is creating a Queen kunks to my Neptune creating


734
00:36:30.600 --> 00:36:32.300
another Queen kunks to my Pluto.


735
00:36:33.400 --> 00:36:34.900
What about all that?


736
00:36:35.600 --> 00:36:38.200
It doesn't take into account any of that. So it doesn't


737
00:36:38.200 --> 00:36:41.600
talk about it only talks about the 10th house or Taurus energy. But


738
00:36:41.600 --> 00:36:44.200
what about my seventh house? What about my fifth house? What about


739
00:36:44.200 --> 00:36:47.200
my third house? What about all these energies in here? And this


740
00:36:47.200 --> 00:36:50.200
is where we're gonna get into ruler shifts and why it is so important


741
00:36:50.200 --> 00:36:53.800
for me to teach you this stuff and why it's personal it


742
00:36:53.800 --> 00:36:54.400
is my


743
00:36:55.500 --> 00:36:58.200
My system and when I do these


744
00:36:58.200 --> 00:37:01.700
readings for you guys either live private readings whatnot. The


745
00:37:01.700 --> 00:37:04.700
reason I can get so accurate and go so many levels in


746
00:37:04.700 --> 00:37:07.700
is because of this system that I created. So


747
00:37:07.700 --> 00:37:10.100
let's keep going so I can get you get to that part here.


748
00:37:11.100 --> 00:37:14.200
So what I want to tell you here, I'm just gonna


749
00:37:14.200 --> 00:37:17.100
I'm not gonna spend too much time on this. I just want to get this out there.


750
00:37:17.100 --> 00:37:20.000
So you'll have the PDF so that you can kind of dive deeper, but I just


751
00:37:20.200 --> 00:37:23.100
want you to understand that retrogrades in


752
00:37:23.100 --> 00:37:27.000
your own birth chart, and I know because I mean


753
00:37:27.300 --> 00:37:27.900
you can just go down here.


754
00:37:28.800 --> 00:37:31.500
And look if you look at my planets here


755
00:37:31.500 --> 00:37:34.600
retrograde retrograde retrograde retrograde retrograde


756
00:37:34.600 --> 00:37:37.800
retrograde two directs retrograde retrograde.


757
00:37:37.800 --> 00:37:40.700
So I have so much here which are


758
00:37:40.700 --> 00:37:43.000
lessons. They're karmic lessons that you're supposed to


759
00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:43.200
learn.


760
00:37:44.500 --> 00:37:47.100
And it's important to understand what they mean. So


761
00:37:47.100 --> 00:37:48.200
I'm just going to go through the main.


762
00:37:49.100 --> 00:37:51.500
The sun cannot be retrograde.


763
00:37:52.100 --> 00:37:55.200
I don't know if anybody's gonna ask me that but just to put it out there the sun


764
00:37:55.200 --> 00:37:58.500
in the moon cannot go retrograde. The moon always goes in


765
00:37:58.500 --> 00:38:01.200
the same same path same orbit because


766
00:38:01.200 --> 00:38:02.700
retrograde has to do with


767
00:38:03.600 --> 00:38:06.300
the point of view the perspective from Earth


768
00:38:06.300 --> 00:38:09.400
planets don't actually travel ever backwards. They're


769
00:38:09.400 --> 00:38:12.900
always moving in perpetual motion, but our perspective


770
00:38:12.900 --> 00:38:15.400
as our orbits go around is that


771
00:38:15.400 --> 00:38:18.200
when it crosses like this that it


772
00:38:18.200 --> 00:38:21.400
appears to be going the other direction that's what a retrograde


773
00:38:21.400 --> 00:38:24.900
is and because of that appearance of energy because


774
00:38:24.900 --> 00:38:26.400
astrology is all about perspective.


775
00:38:27.500 --> 00:38:30.900
It it creates an internalization of


776
00:38:30.900 --> 00:38:33.600
energy. So when we talk about Mercury retrograde, it's


777
00:38:33.600 --> 00:38:36.400
not that mercury is doing things backwards. It's


778
00:38:36.400 --> 00:38:39.300
that it's effects are Inward and that is


779
00:38:39.300 --> 00:38:42.300
what's causing all of the issues. It's not working the way it


780
00:38:42.300 --> 00:38:43.500
normally works. It works inward.


781
00:38:44.400 --> 00:38:47.100
I guess you could say in Reverse, but it's


782
00:38:47.100 --> 00:38:48.200
not really a reversal thing.


783
00:38:49.100 --> 00:38:52.300
So we're when you have Mercury retrograde in


784
00:38:52.300 --> 00:38:55.000
your natal chart, I'm just going to read this off because I just


785
00:38:55.100 --> 00:38:58.700
want to get through it. But you absorb thoughts and ideas through repetition and


786
00:38:58.700 --> 00:39:01.900
osmosis rather than deliberate study as


787
00:39:01.900 --> 00:39:04.000
somebody who's born with a Mercury retrograde. I know


788
00:39:04.400 --> 00:39:07.400
exactly what this feels I have to do it once I


789
00:39:07.400 --> 00:39:10.200
do it and once I've done it a couple times I've got it, but


790
00:39:10.200 --> 00:39:13.400
if I read it in a textbook that was terrible in school.


791
00:39:14.300 --> 00:39:17.900
you know, I was sitting in the advanced placement courses classes and the thing


792
00:39:17.900 --> 00:39:20.500
about advanced placement classes at least in my


793
00:39:20.500 --> 00:39:23.200
school is that they just gave you a bunch


794
00:39:23.200 --> 00:39:25.100
more books to read and they just kind of


795
00:39:26.100 --> 00:39:30.100
oh, look at that a typo. I got to fix that. See that's


796
00:39:29.100 --> 00:39:32.500
also my mercury in my


797
00:39:32.500 --> 00:39:33.200
Mercury Gemini there.


798
00:39:35.100 --> 00:39:38.200
I can't learn like that. I have to learn through applications. So even


799
00:39:38.200 --> 00:39:41.200
when I taught myself astrology I had to learn by


800
00:39:41.200 --> 00:39:44.200
doing charts do a chart do a chart do a chart every time I see


801
00:39:44.200 --> 00:39:47.400
something. Okay, that doesn't make sense. That makes sense. Okay discard this


802
00:39:47.400 --> 00:39:50.600
move this that's how a Mercury retrograde Works you're constantly


803
00:39:50.600 --> 00:39:53.000
editing reviewing and rethinking replaying it


804
00:39:53.200 --> 00:39:56.200
over in your mind. It just keeps cycling until it makes


805
00:39:56.200 --> 00:39:59.100
sense in your mind and it clicks you think out of the


806
00:39:59.100 --> 00:40:02.900
box you think in non-linear patterns and sometimes numbers


807
00:40:02.900 --> 00:40:05.600
so people who have Mercury retrograde


808
00:40:05.600 --> 00:40:08.500
in their chart will think abstractly you don't


809
00:40:08.500 --> 00:40:11.300
get from you know question to answer in


810
00:40:11.300 --> 00:40:15.200
a straight linear pattern you kind of do this until


811
00:40:14.200 --> 00:40:17.400
you get to it or sometimes you'll go into like


812
00:40:17.400 --> 00:40:17.900
this like,


813
00:40:19.700 --> 00:40:22.500
The quantum realm to get there and people


814
00:40:22.500 --> 00:40:26.000
like I don't know how you got that answer is like it doesn't matter and this


815
00:40:25.100 --> 00:40:28.300
can make it really difficult. If you have a child with a Mercury


816
00:40:28.300 --> 00:40:31.300
retrograde it can make it really difficult for them to show their


817
00:40:31.300 --> 00:40:34.400
work in school, especially


818
00:40:34.400 --> 00:40:37.200
in math class because they're not doing it the way


819
00:40:37.200 --> 00:40:40.300
they learned it that way but then in their mind, they're like there's an


820
00:40:40.300 --> 00:40:42.700
easier way. I found a better way and then you know,


821
00:40:43.800 --> 00:40:46.200
They can't they can always get the right answer but


822
00:40:46.200 --> 00:40:49.100
they can't get the answer the way that you did it because


823
00:40:49.100 --> 00:40:51.000
your that your way doesn't make sense to them.


824
00:40:52.200 --> 00:40:55.200
And then they the people with Mercury retrograde are the


825
00:40:55.200 --> 00:40:59.600
ones who constantly they're critical thinkers. They constantly question


826
00:40:58.600 --> 00:41:01.600
what other people say and


827
00:41:01.600 --> 00:41:04.300
sometimes that could be annoying but it's a it's a defense


828
00:41:04.300 --> 00:41:06.900
mechanism. It's because Mercury works inwardly


829
00:41:07.800 --> 00:41:09.800
retrograde Venus with my little typo here.


830
00:41:10.900 --> 00:41:14.100
Is the way that you you


831
00:41:13.100 --> 00:41:16.400
view pleasure and love is different.


832
00:41:16.400 --> 00:41:18.200
It's more of an inward process.


833
00:41:19.400 --> 00:41:23.000
Beauty as well. You might have different beauty standards different way


834
00:41:22.100 --> 00:41:26.000
that you apply Beauty and Love


835
00:41:25.300 --> 00:41:28.200
In general the type of Partnerships you have and what


836
00:41:28.200 --> 00:41:31.400
you need from a partnership isn't as obvious on


837
00:41:31.400 --> 00:41:34.700
the outside. It's a very internalized thing and if you have Venus


838
00:41:34.700 --> 00:41:37.400
retrograde you have to make sure you're communicating these things because people


839
00:41:37.400 --> 00:41:39.100
don't do not understand that.


840
00:41:40.600 --> 00:41:43.700
They're less concerned for things


841
00:41:43.700 --> 00:41:47.200
that are the social norm. And sometimes they'll seek


842
00:41:46.200 --> 00:41:51.000
unconventional. It's kind of a uranium aspect here.


843
00:41:50.900 --> 00:41:53.600
Their Styles their friends their Partners people


844
00:41:53.600 --> 00:41:56.200
that they they associate with they look for people


845
00:41:56.200 --> 00:41:58.800
who are different. They look for people who are not just


846
00:41:59.600 --> 00:42:02.600
Surface pretty on the surface or like relatable


847
00:42:02.600 --> 00:42:06.300
in the surface. They're looking for something more that something inward


848
00:42:05.300 --> 00:42:09.000
that connects outward for them retrograde Mars.


849
00:42:08.600 --> 00:42:12.000
They end up not being as competitive outwardly


850
00:42:11.400 --> 00:42:15.000
because they end up often in competition


851
00:42:14.300 --> 00:42:17.200
with themselves. This is a tough


852
00:42:17.200 --> 00:42:20.600
thing for Retrograde Mars as they're always competing with themselves. Now


853
00:42:20.600 --> 00:42:23.600
if you use it appropriately or use it positively then


854
00:42:23.600 --> 00:42:26.600
you're constantly one upping yourself and you're sending personal records


855
00:42:26.600 --> 00:42:27.800
and you're you know, you're not


856
00:42:29.100 --> 00:42:32.500
judging yourself for not being outwardly competitive you


857
00:42:32.500 --> 00:42:35.400
are competitive. It's just that instead of competing with other people


858
00:42:35.400 --> 00:42:37.000
you're competing with yourself.


859
00:42:37.800 --> 00:42:40.800
The one of the things to look out for is that you've tend


860
00:42:40.800 --> 00:42:43.600
with this retrograde you tend to internalize your


861
00:42:43.600 --> 00:42:47.000
anger and it leaks out instead of expressing


862
00:42:46.200 --> 00:42:49.300
what's wrong you'll hold it in you'll


863
00:42:49.300 --> 00:42:52.900
bottle it up and it comes out in when you


864
00:42:52.900 --> 00:42:55.500
least expect it and you have to look where Mars


865
00:42:55.500 --> 00:42:58.200
is and what house like if it's in the seventh house you're taking


866
00:42:58.200 --> 00:43:01.400
it out on your partner or if it's in Libra you're taking out on your partner. If it's


867
00:43:01.400 --> 00:43:04.200
in the first house you could be taking out anyone or just


868
00:43:04.200 --> 00:43:07.400
in the actions that you do like if you start hammering something and you're


869
00:43:07.400 --> 00:43:10.700
you got this repressed anger you start hammering harder like


870
00:43:10.700 --> 00:43:11.900
just building a chair or something.


871
00:43:13.300 --> 00:43:16.200
We move forward here. Those are the


872
00:43:16.200 --> 00:43:20.000
personal planets. By the way. These are the giant planets Jupiter


873
00:43:19.400 --> 00:43:20.800
and Saturn here.


874
00:43:21.700 --> 00:43:24.700
Sometimes they're referred to as the outer planets as


875
00:43:24.700 --> 00:43:29.000
part of the outer planets, but I see them as semi-generational Jupiter


876
00:43:28.300 --> 00:43:31.100
moves a sign, you know, depending on


877
00:43:31.100 --> 00:43:34.100
retrogrades and whatnot. But usually, you know, seven months to


878
00:43:35.300 --> 00:43:38.300
a little over a year Saturn is usually two


879
00:43:38.300 --> 00:43:41.700
to two and a half years. So I don't see these as generational planets


880
00:43:41.700 --> 00:43:44.200
or outer planets, even though technically the Milky Way,


881
00:43:44.200 --> 00:43:47.500
they are the outer planets. I just refer to him as giant planets.


882
00:43:49.500 --> 00:43:52.200
If you have Jupiter in retrograde, you're capable of taking


883
00:43:52.200 --> 00:43:55.200
advantage of opportunities others ignore a pass by meaning. You


884
00:43:55.200 --> 00:43:58.600
see luck where others don't see luck or


885
00:43:58.600 --> 00:44:01.200
opportunity. You say I don't why aren't you doing that? I


886
00:44:01.200 --> 00:44:04.400
see like if you did that I feel like you could do this this and


887
00:44:04.400 --> 00:44:06.000
this that's kind of a Jupiter retrograde.


888
00:44:06.600 --> 00:44:09.000
They prefer to take another crack at things


889
00:44:09.100 --> 00:44:11.100
that others have tried and failed. So.


890
00:44:13.200 --> 00:44:17.100
You have to realize that these people are this can


891
00:44:16.100 --> 00:44:20.100
go both ways. It can go something. That's


892
00:44:19.100 --> 00:44:22.700
obviously didn't work. It obviously


893
00:44:22.700 --> 00:44:25.100
is a failure these people can try


894
00:44:25.100 --> 00:44:28.200
and try it again thinking that there is some way to make


895
00:44:28.200 --> 00:44:31.200
it work and then other times it works out in a very


896
00:44:31.200 --> 00:44:34.100
positive way where it's like that would have worked but the person


897
00:44:34.100 --> 00:44:37.500
who did it didn't do it right or didn't try something different or


898
00:44:37.500 --> 00:44:40.400
whatever. So these are these are people who want


899
00:44:40.400 --> 00:44:40.800
to do that.


900
00:44:42.600 --> 00:44:44.100
They don't they don't want to give up.


901
00:44:45.200 --> 00:44:48.800
Moral and ethical code religion philosophy of their own they don't conform outward.


902
00:44:48.800 --> 00:44:51.600
They seek answers from within they're always asking


903
00:44:51.600 --> 00:44:54.600
themselves questions philosophically to


904
00:44:54.600 --> 00:44:57.100
find an answer experience has to be


905
00:44:57.100 --> 00:44:58.700
their own experience as well.


906
00:44:59.500 --> 00:45:03.100
They're not they don't care as much as other people's for


907
00:45:02.100 --> 00:45:05.100
other people's experiences as much as their own.


908
00:45:06.300 --> 00:45:09.700
And they seek abundance in new untied and unproven areas.


909
00:45:09.700 --> 00:45:12.700
So they're not these type of people Jupiter


910
00:45:12.700 --> 00:45:15.600
with retro or people with Jupiter retrograde aren't


911
00:45:15.600 --> 00:45:18.200
looking to do the same thing as


912
00:45:18.200 --> 00:45:21.400
everybody else. They forged their own path and usually in


913
00:45:21.400 --> 00:45:22.300
areas that are untested.


914
00:45:25.500 --> 00:45:28.000
Melissa says well, I've never related as much as I do


915
00:45:28.200 --> 00:45:31.100
to Jupiter retrograde which I have. Yeah, a lot


916
00:45:31.100 --> 00:45:34.800
of people there's no information all they talk about here is like I


917
00:45:34.800 --> 00:45:37.100
said, they talk about retrograde as the transit and it's


918
00:45:37.100 --> 00:45:40.800
important to know that but transits and your natal chart are very different. They


919
00:45:40.800 --> 00:45:43.100
have nothing to do with each other one impacts the other


920
00:45:43.100 --> 00:45:46.300
the only way it's the same is the moment you took your


921
00:45:46.300 --> 00:45:49.500
first breath because that outward energy those trance.


922
00:45:49.500 --> 00:45:52.200
It's become your natal chart, but outside of that.


923
00:45:53.300 --> 00:45:56.700
It's not unless you're starting a new business because those transits then


924
00:45:56.700 --> 00:45:59.100
become your business your election will chart


925
00:45:59.100 --> 00:46:02.400
again, electional charts and businesses will be a different class


926
00:46:02.400 --> 00:46:05.900
retrograde Saturn. These people may doubt


927
00:46:05.900 --> 00:46:08.400
their worthiness as human beings. This is a really really


928
00:46:08.400 --> 00:46:11.600
tough one. I have this I also have Chiron in


929
00:46:11.600 --> 00:46:15.200
Taurus which does not make it easy, but this retrograde


930
00:46:14.200 --> 00:46:15.400
here


931
00:46:18.400 --> 00:46:19.800
retrograde in Saturn


932
00:46:20.700 --> 00:46:23.100
It's really tough because you feel like you don't


933
00:46:23.100 --> 00:46:26.300
have authority over anything. All your Authority


934
00:46:26.300 --> 00:46:29.500
is Inward and you're seeking Authority constantly from


935
00:46:29.500 --> 00:46:32.400
yourself. And if you don't have worth and you're


936
00:46:32.400 --> 00:46:35.900
especially if your Venus your Taurus is ill aspected. This is


937
00:46:35.900 --> 00:46:38.700
where a lot of people are like constantly


938
00:46:38.700 --> 00:46:41.400
depressed or constantly, like some


939
00:46:41.400 --> 00:46:44.200
people will view these people as lazy because they just feel


940
00:46:44.200 --> 00:46:47.400
like what's the point? I can't do anything. This is


941
00:46:47.400 --> 00:46:48.600
a really tough retrograde to have


942
00:46:49.600 --> 00:46:50.300
trust me. I know.


943
00:46:51.200 --> 00:46:54.400
They may avoid taking responsibility for their mistakes and be fearful


944
00:46:54.400 --> 00:46:57.400
of taking chances. They could it can


945
00:46:57.400 --> 00:47:00.400
be really tough. And a lot of people have this retrograde Saturn here.


946
00:47:00.400 --> 00:47:03.100
This is where you blame other people now if you've worked on


947
00:47:03.100 --> 00:47:06.700
it, like I have like 20 years ago, I


948
00:47:06.700 --> 00:47:09.600
wasn't okay with this anymore and I started just accepting


949
00:47:09.600 --> 00:47:12.400
blame for everything not everything because you


950
00:47:12.400 --> 00:47:15.300
don't want to go the other side of the spectrum but things I new were my fault


951
00:47:15.300 --> 00:47:17.200
just accept them just own up to it.


952
00:47:18.600 --> 00:47:21.200
But when I was younger, I never wanted to


953
00:47:21.200 --> 00:47:24.300
be blamed for something because I always thought that it may


954
00:47:24.300 --> 00:47:27.900
it always diminish myself worth and that's the thing is they're so


955
00:47:27.900 --> 00:47:30.500
afraid of losing any sort of reputation respect


956
00:47:30.500 --> 00:47:33.300
or authority that they they blame


957
00:47:33.300 --> 00:47:36.100
somebody else so that that's taken off of their chest so they


958
00:47:36.100 --> 00:47:39.100
don't get stuck down or wrong because that's how Saturn and


959
00:47:39.100 --> 00:47:42.300
Capricorn energy is they think in wrongs and Milestones and


960
00:47:42.300 --> 00:47:43.300
they don't want to go backward.


961
00:47:45.200 --> 00:47:48.400
There's a sub often a subconscious fear of rejection and


962
00:47:48.400 --> 00:47:51.100
loss limitation and then you have to see what house we're talking about


963
00:47:51.100 --> 00:47:54.700
limitations and burdens are self-imposed late bloomers.


964
00:47:54.700 --> 00:47:57.700
Now late bloomers, wherever Saturn sits


965
00:47:57.700 --> 00:48:00.400
in your chart, you're already a late bloomer. But Saturn retrograde


966
00:48:00.400 --> 00:48:03.300
kind of makes you even more so a late bloomer


967
00:48:03.300 --> 00:48:07.000
you have more lessons to learn on your inward Authority and


968
00:48:06.200 --> 00:48:09.700
how you can be the authority over yourself to


969
00:48:09.700 --> 00:48:12.400
be even able to exert authority over


970
00:48:12.400 --> 00:48:15.300
anybody else or in any area of


971
00:48:15.300 --> 00:48:18.900
your life. So it takes a lot longer to learn these lessons. If


972
00:48:18.900 --> 00:48:21.100
you have a child with retrograde Saturn you want


973
00:48:21.100 --> 00:48:24.100
to work on this you want to make sure that they have self-worth that


974
00:48:24.100 --> 00:48:27.400
they feel like the things that they can do are supported especially


975
00:48:27.400 --> 00:48:30.300
if there are Leo placements involved with Saturn here


976
00:48:30.300 --> 00:48:31.200
because they will feel


977
00:48:32.400 --> 00:48:35.300
Less than and obviously you don't want that as a


978
00:48:35.300 --> 00:48:35.400
parent.


979
00:48:39.300 --> 00:48:41.000
Yeah, Saturn retrograde is very common.


980
00:48:41.900 --> 00:48:44.200
Angie says I need to learn


981
00:48:44.200 --> 00:48:45.000
this 20 years ago.


982
00:48:46.300 --> 00:48:49.500
Like I said, I don't understand why no one talks about this. It is


983
00:48:49.500 --> 00:48:52.600
so important and there's so much misinformation and there's


984
00:48:52.600 --> 00:48:55.700
so much just like passivity over this topic and


985
00:48:55.700 --> 00:48:58.500
it's so important to understand especially like if you


986
00:48:58.500 --> 00:49:01.100
have half of your planets are in retrograde, you


987
00:49:01.100 --> 00:49:02.000
need to understand what they mean.


988
00:49:04.900 --> 00:49:07.400
Danielle, can you walk through how you got your chart in?


989
00:49:07.400 --> 00:49:10.600
Whatever site you're using. I want to follow along using my


990
00:49:10.600 --> 00:49:13.300
chart. I'll do this real quick. I teach this


991
00:49:13.300 --> 00:49:16.800
in the first class, but real quick. It's astro.com


992
00:49:16.800 --> 00:49:20.000
astro.com, and


993
00:49:19.200 --> 00:49:22.700
then you'll go in the menu to Extended chart


994
00:49:22.700 --> 00:49:25.100
selection, which will pull up this.


995
00:49:26.600 --> 00:49:30.200
Here and for just quick make


996
00:49:29.200 --> 00:49:32.400
sure your birth info is loaded in


997
00:49:32.400 --> 00:49:35.600
here the date doesn't matter because we're not doing as we're


998
00:49:35.600 --> 00:49:38.700
not doing transits right now and under zodiac


999
00:49:38.700 --> 00:49:41.500
and houses if it's not expanded make sure you expand it.


1000
00:49:41.500 --> 00:49:44.500
And then it may be on default or placidus


1001
00:49:44.500 --> 00:49:47.700
go down a whole signs and make sure whole science is activated. The


1002
00:49:47.700 --> 00:49:50.200
rest doesn't really matter and you can use


1003
00:49:50.200 --> 00:49:53.500
either the green button at the top or the green button at the bottom which isn't


1004
00:49:53.500 --> 00:49:56.700
showing on your screen, but there's one at the top and bottom click


1005
00:49:56.700 --> 00:49:59.200
that it'll show your chart and then this is


1006
00:49:59.200 --> 00:49:59.600
what you'll have.


1007
00:50:03.200 --> 00:50:06.800
All right, and let's talk about the true outer planets


1008
00:50:06.800 --> 00:50:09.200
or the generational planets here, which are


1009
00:50:09.200 --> 00:50:12.800
Uranus Neptune in Pluto. I do want to stress again that


1010
00:50:12.800 --> 00:50:15.100
people who do Hellenistic Vedic or


1011
00:50:16.500 --> 00:50:19.900
Traditional astrology do not use these three


1012
00:50:19.900 --> 00:50:22.800
planets, which I think is ridiculous. These


1013
00:50:22.800 --> 00:50:26.200
planets have like obvious specific


1014
00:50:25.200 --> 00:50:29.300
meanings and impacts on our lives, but


1015
00:50:28.300 --> 00:50:31.400
you know, they stick to what was known and here's


1016
00:50:31.400 --> 00:50:34.300
the thing and why I teach astrology, I don't know everything.


1017
00:50:35.300 --> 00:50:38.500
You don't know everything the textbooks don't know everything and


1018
00:50:38.500 --> 00:50:41.300
certainly the people from 2000 years ago didn't know everything.


1019
00:50:41.300 --> 00:50:44.300
So as we learn new planets exist or


1020
00:50:44.300 --> 00:50:46.500
comets or asteroids or fixed Stars.


1021
00:50:47.300 --> 00:50:50.400
Mathematical points degree Theory any


1022
00:50:50.400 --> 00:50:53.900
of this as we come across the accuracy of learning


1023
00:50:53.900 --> 00:50:56.700
this we need to implement it. Now this


1024
00:50:56.700 --> 00:50:59.300
can go to far and one way


1025
00:50:59.300 --> 00:51:02.400
it's going too far is modern astrologers are trying to make


1026
00:51:02.400 --> 00:51:05.600
Chiron the ruler of Virgo.


1027
00:51:06.600 --> 00:51:06.900
and


1028
00:51:08.100 --> 00:51:09.500
there is a healing and


1029
00:51:10.800 --> 00:51:13.600
health-esque aspect to Chiron


1030
00:51:14.400 --> 00:51:17.900
but it has nothing to do with organization or employees or


1031
00:51:17.900 --> 00:51:20.000
day-to-day life or work or any of that


1032
00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:20.300
so


1033
00:51:21.500 --> 00:51:24.000
This is why you know just have to be careful what you're


1034
00:51:24.500 --> 00:51:27.600
learning out there. And when you're coming up with your own theories, make sure you're rounding


1035
00:51:27.600 --> 00:51:30.500
it out meaning everything that you're talking about everything that


1036
00:51:30.500 --> 00:51:33.300
you're theoreticizing. It all makes sense


1037
00:51:33.300 --> 00:51:36.600
that your hypothesis cannot be proven untrue. That's


1038
00:51:36.600 --> 00:51:39.500
the whole science of it astrology is a


1039
00:51:39.500 --> 00:51:42.700
science and anyone who says otherwise has never


1040
00:51:42.700 --> 00:51:45.600
actually pulled up a chart looked at numbers looked


1041
00:51:45.600 --> 00:51:48.200
at degrees looked at aspects and more


1042
00:51:48.200 --> 00:51:51.200
importantly you've never looked in an ephemeris and more importantly


1043
00:51:51.200 --> 00:51:54.700
than that. You've never done this long form now admittedly. I


1044
00:51:54.700 --> 00:51:57.200
haven't done this long form because why would I


1045
00:51:57.200 --> 00:52:00.400
when you can take an ephemeris and you can chart out the mapping


1046
00:52:00.400 --> 00:52:03.400
of all the planets and all the aspects if you really wanted to


1047
00:52:03.400 --> 00:52:06.300
or you can use the software the software's all based on


1048
00:52:06.300 --> 00:52:06.900
an ephemeris.


1049
00:52:07.700 --> 00:52:10.700
Which is the mapping out of planetary positions, but


1050
00:52:10.700 --> 00:52:13.700
let's get back into generational Planet meanings for retrogrades


1051
00:52:13.700 --> 00:52:17.300
Uranus if your Uranus is in retrograde,


1052
00:52:16.300 --> 00:52:19.700
then you are just a natural born Rebel not


1053
00:52:19.700 --> 00:52:23.600
only is Uranus rebellious, but you internally and


1054
00:52:22.600 --> 00:52:25.100
like the Deep part of you


1055
00:52:25.100 --> 00:52:28.400
a rebellious now, this can be good, but it can also get yourself


1056
00:52:28.400 --> 00:52:32.400
into trouble because you rebel against everything especially


1057
00:52:31.400 --> 00:52:33.100
Authority.


1058
00:52:34.100 --> 00:52:37.300
Strong reformer instincts for everybody else. You're always trying


1059
00:52:37.300 --> 00:52:40.300
to help other people fix themselves or live a better


1060
00:52:40.300 --> 00:52:43.300
life, which can come across humanitarian. But obviously you want


1061
00:52:43.300 --> 00:52:45.300
to be careful that you're not just telling people how to be


1062
00:52:46.200 --> 00:52:49.200
these folks have a strong inner need and desire to


1063
00:52:49.200 --> 00:52:52.400
persistently test their personal abilities against those of


1064
00:52:52.400 --> 00:52:55.200
others because they're always looking for change always trying to break the


1065
00:52:55.200 --> 00:52:58.400
system. That's what urine is always is but they're always trying


1066
00:52:58.400 --> 00:53:02.200
to do it for themselves. They must constantly prove themselves to


1067
00:53:01.200 --> 00:53:04.400
themselves. This is kind of like Mars.


1068
00:53:05.400 --> 00:53:08.500
Retrograde where you're it's like goes Inward and your


1069
00:53:08.500 --> 00:53:11.500
competition is you but this is Uranus. It's always your proving


1070
00:53:11.500 --> 00:53:14.100
yourself to yourself. You're trying to make it seem as though


1071
00:53:14.100 --> 00:53:18.000
your structure your foundations and everything you're doing makes sense


1072
00:53:17.200 --> 00:53:20.300
to yourself and then you'll test yourself by like


1073
00:53:20.300 --> 00:53:23.400
throwing something out of work out of whack or just


1074
00:53:23.400 --> 00:53:26.500
trying to divert and do something differently just to prove


1075
00:53:26.500 --> 00:53:28.500
that you can sustain it.


1076
00:53:29.400 --> 00:53:32.500
Retrograde Neptune this one really tough too. You


1077
00:53:32.500 --> 00:53:35.700
can be confused inwardly as to whether they're virtuous or


1078
00:53:35.700 --> 00:53:38.200
not. You might not know if you're a good person or not with


1079
00:53:38.200 --> 00:53:41.200
a Neptune retrograde. You can


1080
00:53:41.200 --> 00:53:44.700
make it very difficult to tell are you a good person or are you


1081
00:53:44.700 --> 00:53:46.000
doing something you're supposed to be doing?


1082
00:53:46.900 --> 00:53:49.400
Persistently seeking to help others whether


1083
00:53:49.400 --> 00:53:52.800
the help is wanted or not. Obviously, you have to be careful there super


1084
00:53:52.800 --> 00:53:55.000
generous super helpful always looking out for the


1085
00:53:55.600 --> 00:53:58.700
underdog because you feel like the underdog


1086
00:53:58.700 --> 00:54:01.400
but sometimes you're looking for that quality in other


1087
00:54:01.400 --> 00:54:04.600
people and trying to offer help that is not that is unsolicited.


1088
00:54:05.500 --> 00:54:08.600
more susceptible more easily taken advantage of by others


1089
00:54:08.600 --> 00:54:11.500
and that is simply because there's an illusional quality


1090
00:54:11.500 --> 00:54:14.800
of how you see yourself and how you view yourself and


1091
00:54:14.800 --> 00:54:17.800
you always want to help everybody else because you have a


1092
00:54:17.800 --> 00:54:18.700
utopian View


1093
00:54:19.500 --> 00:54:22.900
On your it's like a savior complex and you


1094
00:54:22.900 --> 00:54:25.500
have to be careful. Like you could be a savior type


1095
00:54:25.500 --> 00:54:28.200
person, but you have to be you know, you don't want to push that out on


1096
00:54:28.200 --> 00:54:31.400
other people and then retrograde Pluto half the


1097
00:54:31.400 --> 00:54:34.700
population has this because Pluto stays in retrograde for so long. It's very


1098
00:54:34.700 --> 00:54:37.400
difficult time accepting transformation or fully accepting


1099
00:54:37.400 --> 00:54:40.300
death. These are people who have issues with mortality on


1100
00:54:40.300 --> 00:54:42.500
one, you know, one run or another


1101
00:54:43.300 --> 00:54:46.600
and they have a really hard time with with change and


1102
00:54:46.600 --> 00:54:47.100
I don't mean


1103
00:54:48.100 --> 00:54:51.900
Like changing their mind or changing direction. It's more like the things


1104
00:54:51.900 --> 00:54:55.000
that they've done and the things that they want to


1105
00:54:55.600 --> 00:54:58.300
accomplish and realizing that sometimes things come in and really


1106
00:54:58.300 --> 00:55:01.200
disrupt your world. And even if it's pushing you towards


1107
00:55:01.200 --> 00:55:05.600
a positive path that could be really difficult to accept that because


1108
00:55:04.600 --> 00:55:07.400
you don't understand transformation and


1109
00:55:07.400 --> 00:55:10.100
that transformation also because it's retrograde comes from


1110
00:55:10.100 --> 00:55:13.600
a very deep Place very up, you know very much


1111
00:55:13.600 --> 00:55:15.200
a sense of upheaval.


1112
00:55:17.400 --> 00:55:20.300
That comes from such a deep. It's not


1113
00:55:20.300 --> 00:55:22.900
a wound or anything like that. It is karmic.


1114
00:55:23.600 --> 00:55:26.200
But it can really disrupt your world here.


1115
00:55:26.900 --> 00:55:29.600
And then the question their own personal power and unaware


1116
00:55:29.600 --> 00:55:32.600
of their effect on others and I see this all the time I have


1117
00:55:32.600 --> 00:55:35.600
this again is you don't realize that


1118
00:55:35.600 --> 00:55:38.100
it mines in the third house. I don't realize that when I


1119
00:55:38.100 --> 00:55:41.600
say things to people that it actually like it doesn't


1120
00:55:41.600 --> 00:55:44.500
just go here but it goes here and then Coach like deep down and


1121
00:55:44.500 --> 00:55:47.500
it either cuts to the core of them if I'm you


1122
00:55:47.500 --> 00:55:50.200
like when I was younger when I used to say things off the cuff that


1123
00:55:50.200 --> 00:55:54.600
were just like slash attacks or when


1124
00:55:53.600 --> 00:55:56.000
I meet somebody and I'm just


1125
00:55:56.300 --> 00:55:59.300
in the middle of conversation and I'll say something and it'll just resonate at


1126
00:55:59.300 --> 00:56:02.200
such a deep level. I'm unaware that I have


1127
00:56:02.200 --> 00:56:02.800
that ability.


1128
00:56:03.700 --> 00:56:07.000
I just I don't I don't see it. And that's


1129
00:56:06.500 --> 00:56:09.100
that's just part of this retrograde is that


1130
00:56:09.100 --> 00:56:12.500
you had such an internalized power that you you're more


1131
00:56:12.500 --> 00:56:15.500
powerful in some ways. Once you accept that you're powerful and


1132
00:56:15.500 --> 00:56:17.300
then can put that power outwardly.


1133
00:56:18.300 --> 00:56:21.100
But personal power not realizing that you


1134
00:56:21.100 --> 00:56:24.700
can do the things that you can do, especially within the area that Pluto


1135
00:56:24.700 --> 00:56:27.500
sits in your chart. So those are the retrogrades again. I just


1136
00:56:27.500 --> 00:56:30.500
feel that they're extremely important and when you're reading a


1137
00:56:30.500 --> 00:56:33.300
chart it just kind of adds additional information


1138
00:56:33.300 --> 00:56:36.600
so that you can just


1139
00:56:36.600 --> 00:56:39.100
understand somebody on a


1140
00:56:39.100 --> 00:56:42.300
deeper level that their Mercury might not play out the same as somebody else's


1141
00:56:42.300 --> 00:56:45.300
Mercury so I would I would kind of Commit This to Memory a


1142
00:56:45.300 --> 00:56:49.600
little bit just so you understand that retrogrades are internalized and natal


1143
00:56:48.600 --> 00:56:53.200
retrogrades are different than Transit retrogrades.


1144
00:56:54.500 --> 00:56:57.600
I'm gonna Dive Right into deccan's it's super easy again. I'm


1145
00:56:57.600 --> 00:56:58.500
just gonna read through this because


1146
00:56:59.600 --> 00:57:03.300
there's not much to it deckons not deacons


1147
00:57:02.300 --> 00:57:05.400
deccans. I don't


1148
00:57:05.400 --> 00:57:08.700
know why people are pronouncing it deacons. It's not a


1149
00:57:08.700 --> 00:57:12.700
member of the church. It's based off of deca meaning


1150
00:57:11.700 --> 00:57:14.600
10. So it's Deca and


1151
00:57:14.600 --> 00:57:17.800
deca and Deccan but every


1152
00:57:17.800 --> 00:57:20.500
zodiac sign is comprised of 30 degrees.


1153
00:57:20.500 --> 00:57:23.800
I don't remember if we went through that on the first class, but I'm


1154
00:57:23.800 --> 00:57:25.000
just gonna take an empty house here.


1155
00:57:26.200 --> 00:57:30.200
5 10 15 20 25 30 degrees here


1156
00:57:29.200 --> 00:57:32.400
and you'll notice that when you


1157
00:57:32.400 --> 00:57:35.800
have traditional deck in selected that the


1158
00:57:35.800 --> 00:57:38.300
first 10 degrees has a glyph then the next


1159
00:57:38.300 --> 00:57:39.400
10 then the next 10.


1160
00:57:40.100 --> 00:57:43.600
So each deck in is a 10 degree subdivision


1161
00:57:43.600 --> 00:57:47.000
within a sign. So here's one sign, you


1162
00:57:46.300 --> 00:57:49.200
know, 10 degrees 10 degrees 10 degrees 30 total. You


1163
00:57:49.200 --> 00:57:50.700
see it the next sign same thing.


1164
00:57:53.500 --> 00:57:56.800
When we go back here each deck in matches, the


1165
00:57:56.800 --> 00:57:59.600
current sign that is highlighted or in


1166
00:57:59.600 --> 00:58:03.200
question or off topic the next two decades in


1167
00:58:02.200 --> 00:58:05.200
that same sign are the next of


1168
00:58:05.200 --> 00:58:07.600
the same element in order.


1169
00:58:08.800 --> 00:58:11.200
Now I'm going to show you what that means because I want you to


1170
00:58:11.200 --> 00:58:14.900
fully understand it because it's very easy concept, but if you have


1171
00:58:14.900 --> 00:58:17.500
an issue learning in this method, I'm going


1172
00:58:17.500 --> 00:58:18.200
to show you visually.


1173
00:58:19.200 --> 00:58:20.000
Pisces here


1174
00:58:20.900 --> 00:58:23.500
And remember these are traditional deckons. So the


1175
00:58:23.500 --> 00:58:26.700
first Tekken is the same as the sign meaning. This


1176
00:58:26.700 --> 00:58:29.100
is Pisces Pisces. And you see this is


1177
00:58:29.100 --> 00:58:32.600
the sign for Neptune not Pisces because it's the planet


1178
00:58:32.600 --> 00:58:35.500
it could be the sign but it's


1179
00:58:35.500 --> 00:58:38.100
showing the planet that is the ruler here. So it is


1180
00:58:38.100 --> 00:58:41.500
Pisces Pisces when you go around the Zodiac wheel.


1181
00:58:42.300 --> 00:58:43.900
Pisces at the 12th house.


1182
00:58:48.400 --> 00:58:51.200
But sorry Pisces usually sits at the 12th house. Remember


1183
00:58:51.200 --> 00:58:54.700
everything goes counterclockwise. So the next one here would be


1184
00:58:54.700 --> 00:58:57.100
cancer. So when we look here we see


1185
00:58:57.100 --> 00:59:00.500
that the moon or cancer is the second deck in and then


1186
00:59:00.500 --> 00:59:03.400
as we continue on the next one will be Scorpio before it


1187
00:59:03.400 --> 00:59:06.500
gets back up to Pisces and there we have it Scorpio, which


1188
00:59:06.500 --> 00:59:09.700
is ruled by Pluto so you can read it. However you


1189
00:59:09.700 --> 00:59:12.800
want you could say that it is the Neptune deck


1190
00:59:12.800 --> 00:59:15.500
in of Pisces the moon deck in a Pisces the Pluto


1191
00:59:15.500 --> 00:59:19.400
deck in a Pisces or you can say net Neptune Neptune.


1192
00:59:18.400 --> 00:59:21.400
I'm sorry Pisces Pisces


1193
00:59:21.400 --> 00:59:23.700
Pisces cancer Pisces Scorpio


1194
00:59:24.500 --> 00:59:27.400
It doesn't really matter how you say it. I'm telling


1195
00:59:27.400 --> 00:59:30.200
you both ways of saying it because if you're reading up on


1196
00:59:30.200 --> 00:59:34.000
deccans, you may see it in either way often,


1197
00:59:33.100 --> 00:59:37.400
you'll see Pisces Pisces Pisces cancer Pisces


1198
00:59:36.400 --> 00:59:37.700
Scorpio.


1199
00:59:38.400 --> 00:59:41.200
We go into Aries same thing, right? So if


1200
00:59:41.200 --> 00:59:44.200
I go back over here to Aries the next one.


1201
00:59:44.200 --> 00:59:47.800
The first one is Aries ruled by Mars the


1202
00:59:47.800 --> 00:59:50.100
second one if I keep going around is Leo.


1203
00:59:50.700 --> 00:59:53.200
So you see Leo the Sun and then the next


1204
00:59:53.200 --> 00:59:56.800
one would be Sagittarius or Jupiter. We


1205
00:59:56.800 --> 00:59:59.700
see Jupiter right here as the ruler of Sagittarius. So


1206
00:59:59.700 --> 01:00:02.400
these are the three decades. Remember the first Decon is always


1207
01:00:02.400 --> 01:00:05.400
the purest form the first 10 degrees of the purest


1208
01:00:05.400 --> 01:00:08.200
form meaning it's always the same as we go


1209
01:00:08.200 --> 01:00:09.800
to Taurus. It's Taurus Venus.


1210
01:00:10.500 --> 01:00:12.900
Or the Venus deck of Taurus or Taurus Taurus.


1211
01:00:13.500 --> 01:00:14.400
Gemini Gemini


1212
01:00:15.200 --> 01:00:16.900
cancer cancer you get the point.


1213
01:00:18.100 --> 01:00:22.400
If we go back over here to Pisces, it's actually you


1214
01:00:22.400 --> 01:00:25.900
know, what? I'm gonna do. I'm just gonna go over here. So my ascendant


1215
01:00:25.900 --> 01:00:28.500
is at 13 degrees. So it


1216
01:00:28.500 --> 01:00:32.000
is Leo Sagittarius. If


1217
01:00:31.100 --> 01:00:34.300
I was up here, it'd be a Leo Leo if I


1218
01:00:34.300 --> 01:00:37.600
was down here be a Leo Aries, ironically my


1219
01:00:37.600 --> 01:00:40.100
daughter my almost two year


1220
01:00:40.100 --> 01:00:43.000
old. She's here. I'm here and my wife


1221
01:00:43.100 --> 01:00:46.600
is down here. So we actually Encompass three Leo


1222
01:00:46.600 --> 01:00:49.300
risings with all three decades within our house and you


1223
01:00:49.300 --> 01:00:50.300
can see how they play off.


1224
01:00:51.300 --> 01:00:54.000
I'll tell you what that actually means in just a moment.


1225
01:00:54.900 --> 01:00:57.600
Hmm, so it's always the same element


1226
01:00:57.600 --> 01:01:00.300
meaning water water. If you're in


1227
01:01:00.300 --> 01:01:03.400
Pisces, if you're talking about Leo, then it's it's fire


1228
01:01:03.400 --> 01:01:06.200
fire again in order. So I hope that was clear


1229
01:01:06.200 --> 01:01:09.600
and the example. I already showed you here. So what


1230
01:01:09.600 --> 01:01:12.600
a deckon does is it adds further detail to the


1231
01:01:12.600 --> 01:01:15.700
position of each planet within the Zodiac wheel. It's


1232
01:01:15.700 --> 01:01:18.700
very important that in our system of learning that


1233
01:01:18.700 --> 01:01:21.900
we use traditional / modern deckons. They're


1234
01:01:21.900 --> 01:01:24.100
actually modern deckons, but when you go to


1235
01:01:28.800 --> 01:01:32.200
And let's go in here. When you go to cast a chart


1236
01:01:31.200 --> 01:01:35.700
on Astro it says traditional deckons


1237
01:01:34.700 --> 01:01:37.700
right there, right? So that's


1238
01:01:37.700 --> 01:01:38.600
clicked for me.


1239
01:01:40.400 --> 01:01:44.000
Chaldean deckons that you see here are something


1240
01:01:43.200 --> 01:01:46.300
very different. I'm going to tell you what that is in a second.


1241
01:01:46.300 --> 01:01:50.200
I don't even bother with this one manelius. I


1242
01:01:49.200 --> 01:01:52.100
don't deal at that one traditional deck is


1243
01:01:52.100 --> 01:01:54.600
what I use and that's how we get the chart that I have.


1244
01:01:55.700 --> 01:01:57.100
Close that out. Boom.


1245
01:01:58.500 --> 01:02:01.400
Uh, Chaldean deckons are


1246
01:02:01.400 --> 01:02:04.900
a ranking of planets by speed up till


1247
01:02:04.900 --> 01:02:07.200
Saturn. So Saturn being the


1248
01:02:07.200 --> 01:02:11.300
slowest one is in order and then the


1249
01:02:10.300 --> 01:02:13.700
Moon being the fastest one will


1250
01:02:13.700 --> 01:02:16.200
be at the other end. They are not in any order other than


1251
01:02:16.200 --> 01:02:19.600
my speed now, I have tested cowday and


1252
01:02:19.600 --> 01:02:22.300
deccans and they I don't why would you


1253
01:02:22.300 --> 01:02:25.200
do that? It has it just doesn't play out. You guys


1254
01:02:25.200 --> 01:02:28.300
can always test it right. You don't have to take my word you can sit


1255
01:02:28.300 --> 01:02:29.900
there and you can switch everything over.


1256
01:02:31.400 --> 01:02:34.600
Here you could go to to whoops to


1257
01:02:34.600 --> 01:02:37.200
Astro we could go back here and you'll notice


1258
01:02:37.200 --> 01:02:39.600
that if I switch over to Chaldean.


1259
01:02:42.600 --> 01:02:43.700
that's


1260
01:02:44.900 --> 01:02:45.900
you'll see Venus.


1261
01:02:46.700 --> 01:02:49.200
Here, so, it's Mars the Sun.


1262
01:02:50.100 --> 01:02:53.400
Which is normal, but then you'll see Venus here instead of Jupiter.


1263
01:02:54.400 --> 01:02:57.600
And then if you go to Pisces it start instead


1264
01:02:57.600 --> 01:03:00.500
of starting with well, it doesn't use Neptune. Right it only use a Saturn.


1265
01:03:00.500 --> 01:03:02.700
So use the Saturn here even though Jupiter.


1266
01:03:03.500 --> 01:03:06.600
Is the traditional ruler of Pisces it starts


1267
01:03:06.600 --> 01:03:09.300
with Saturn. Anyway, it really doesn't make any


1268
01:03:09.300 --> 01:03:13.200
sense. And this is why I don't use it. It's confusing


1269
01:03:12.200 --> 01:03:15.200
and more importantly than it being


1270
01:03:15.200 --> 01:03:18.600
confusing is that it just doesn't work if you actually use it and


1271
01:03:18.600 --> 01:03:21.200
and play around with it. It doesn't


1272
01:03:21.200 --> 01:03:23.700
play that way. So the whole purpose here is to say that


1273
01:03:28.400 --> 01:03:29.900
And what's the easy one to use?


1274
01:03:32.400 --> 01:03:35.500
So my Saturn I guess my Saturn


1275
01:03:35.500 --> 01:03:38.200
placement here, which is in retrograde. So I would need to know how


1276
01:03:38.200 --> 01:03:42.400
that plays out at 15 degrees is sitting in the Uranus deck


1277
01:03:41.400 --> 01:03:44.400
in of Libra. That's how


1278
01:03:44.400 --> 01:03:47.500
I would naturally say at the Uranus deck of Libra because


1279
01:03:47.500 --> 01:03:50.400
I apply uranium themes because I think in


1280
01:03:50.400 --> 01:03:52.600
terms of planets more than I think in terms of signs.


1281
01:03:53.300 --> 01:03:56.700
Just because it's always planet sign


1282
01:03:56.700 --> 01:03:59.800
house to me. Even though houses are extremely


1283
01:03:59.800 --> 01:04:02.700
important. I need to know what we're dealing with. So it's


1284
01:04:02.700 --> 01:04:05.600
uranium. So basically my Saturn is


1285
01:04:05.600 --> 01:04:07.800
a Libra Aquarian Saturn.


1286
01:04:08.700 --> 01:04:11.200
But to me, that's more confusing because my mind doesn't work.


1287
01:04:11.200 --> 01:04:14.400
That way. I work again in planets. So if


1288
01:04:14.400 --> 01:04:17.200
it's easier for you to do the other way, that's fine. But it's


1289
01:04:17.200 --> 01:04:20.200
all the same thing. I just do Uranus deck of Libra if somebody


1290
01:04:20.200 --> 01:04:23.500
asks me if I'm looking it up. Yes. My Saturn is a Libra


1291
01:04:23.500 --> 01:04:26.200
Aquarian Saturn but it just means that instead of


1292
01:04:26.200 --> 01:04:29.000
it just being pure Libra energy that it is


1293
01:04:29.500 --> 01:04:32.100
has a flavor of uranium and traits to it.


1294
01:04:32.100 --> 01:04:35.900
Whereas my Mars at five degrees is a pure Libra


1295
01:04:35.900 --> 01:04:40.600
energy and my Pluto is a Gemini energy.


1296
01:04:39.600 --> 01:04:42.700
So my Pluto has to do with communication.


1297
01:04:42.700 --> 01:04:47.200
My Pluto energy has to do with potentially siblings.


1298
01:04:46.200 --> 01:04:49.300
And actually it it did.


1299
01:04:51.700 --> 01:04:54.500
with this Saturn sitting


1300
01:04:54.500 --> 01:04:54.800
here in


1301
01:04:55.700 --> 01:04:58.300
Uranus means that my work would have


1302
01:04:58.300 --> 01:05:01.800
Uranian traits meaning I work in teams.


1303
01:05:01.800 --> 01:05:04.400
I work one-on-one in teams. I work one-on-one online.


1304
01:05:04.400 --> 01:05:07.600
What am I doing? Right now? I work one-on-one or


1305
01:05:07.600 --> 01:05:11.100
with the public or in my own business with networking,


1306
01:05:10.100 --> 01:05:13.100
which is what I do. If you guys hear me


1307
01:05:13.100 --> 01:05:16.400
talk about the types of businesses we have and how we run them. It's all


1308
01:05:16.400 --> 01:05:17.100
through networking.


1309
01:05:17.800 --> 01:05:20.700
And then that all aspects other things bring in,


1310
01:05:20.700 --> 01:05:23.100
you know other people's research and whatever we'll talk about


1311
01:05:23.100 --> 01:05:26.500
all of how that works. But that is that is


1312
01:05:26.500 --> 01:05:29.100
deckons. They're pretty simple if I have to do


1313
01:05:29.100 --> 01:05:32.500
another class or a refresher course or anything like that. I'll do


1314
01:05:32.500 --> 01:05:35.600
it but decades are pretty it's just a flavor. So you're still


1315
01:05:35.600 --> 01:05:38.500
reading like if you have a planet in Aries, you're


1316
01:05:38.500 --> 01:05:41.800
still reading Aries energy. But if you want more detail,


1317
01:05:41.800 --> 01:05:44.100
then you go into the deck and just


1318
01:05:44.100 --> 01:05:47.400
to highlight what flavor of Aries are we talking


1319
01:05:47.400 --> 01:05:50.300
about? So if you're talking about just Mars Mars Aries or


1320
01:05:50.300 --> 01:05:53.200
Aries Aries, then it's just pure areas energy. If


1321
01:05:53.200 --> 01:05:56.600
you're talking about the sun. Then you have to add a little bit of drama a


1322
01:05:56.600 --> 01:05:59.500
little bit of entertainment a little bit of ego or personality into


1323
01:05:59.500 --> 01:06:02.200
the Aries energy. And then Jupiter would be


1324
01:06:02.200 --> 01:06:05.500
the third one you be offering like teaching travel


1325
01:06:05.500 --> 01:06:08.400
culture things like that higher education


1326
01:06:08.400 --> 01:06:08.900
learning.


1327
01:06:10.300 --> 01:06:13.300
So let me switch back to here. So that's


1328
01:06:13.300 --> 01:06:16.900
pretty simple. All right, this is the meat meat and potatoes. We're


1329
01:06:16.900 --> 01:06:18.600
getting in here. So making good time.


1330
01:06:19.500 --> 01:06:22.200
That would be so confusing in.


1331
01:06:24.900 --> 01:06:28.100
I don't have the rest of that statement Angela.


1332
01:06:27.100 --> 01:06:31.000
That would be so confusing in.


1333
01:06:38.400 --> 01:06:41.000
I'm gonna wait a second to see if there's the rest of a sentence.


1334
01:06:42.100 --> 01:06:45.800
In plow. Oh and placidus. Oh God,


1335
01:06:45.800 --> 01:06:48.300
I'm gonna show it to you because I think


1336
01:06:48.300 --> 01:06:51.300
you're bringing up a valid point. We've debunked Plaza


1337
01:06:51.300 --> 01:06:54.600
this a hundred times, but I'm gonna show you what ends up happening.


1338
01:06:55.900 --> 01:06:59.400
So you do have the what's


1339
01:06:58.400 --> 01:07:01.900
the easiest one? You're you're saying?


1340
01:07:01.900 --> 01:07:05.500
That's not even these one six house


1341
01:07:05.500 --> 01:07:05.800
roller.


1342
01:07:06.200 --> 01:07:09.400
Sixth house ruler. Sorry, you couldn't see that sixth house


1343
01:07:09.400 --> 01:07:13.100
ruler here in Placid is sitting in Capricorn. That's


1344
01:07:12.100 --> 01:07:16.800
actually no different. My six house is Capricorn and


1345
01:07:15.800 --> 01:07:17.600
it is sitting at


1346
01:07:19.300 --> 01:07:19.700
I have to


1347
01:07:20.700 --> 01:07:23.000
Look at it. That's right. This doesn't show me.


1348
01:07:23.300 --> 01:07:24.500
So it's sitting roughly at


1349
01:07:25.500 --> 01:07:29.200
13 and a half degrees. So right


1350
01:07:28.200 --> 01:07:31.400
on myself node in placidus,


1351
01:07:31.400 --> 01:07:33.500
which that could be extremely confusing because you're like


1352
01:07:34.200 --> 01:07:37.400
You have to go find the exact minutes for that. And I


1353
01:07:37.400 --> 01:07:40.100
mean you have to do that. Anyway, even in


1354
01:07:40.100 --> 01:07:43.200
whole signs of it sitting at zero or 29 degrees, but it's a


1355
01:07:43.200 --> 01:07:46.700
lot more obvious than it is here. But anyway, that means my sixth house


1356
01:07:46.700 --> 01:07:48.900
is actually sitting here in.


1357
01:07:50.200 --> 01:07:53.500
The Taurus Deccan and that would actually mean that


1358
01:07:53.500 --> 01:07:54.200
my work.


1359
01:07:54.900 --> 01:07:57.200
Has really not fair because my tenth house


1360
01:07:57.200 --> 01:08:01.000
is Taurus, but my work will be specific to like


1361
01:08:00.700 --> 01:08:03.400
Taurus types themes. What's what's one, that's


1362
01:08:03.400 --> 01:08:04.400
not so obvious.


1363
01:08:10.800 --> 01:08:13.400
This seventh house. So my seventh house would be


1364
01:08:13.400 --> 01:08:16.000
Gemini. That means my main.


1365
01:08:17.100 --> 01:08:21.100
Aspects to communication or to to relationships


1366
01:08:20.100 --> 01:08:23.500
would always be communication wouldn't


1367
01:08:23.500 --> 01:08:26.500
be in within friendship communication within friendship


1368
01:08:26.500 --> 01:08:29.600
thing is I don't actually talk to my friends that often. I


1369
01:08:29.600 --> 01:08:32.300
have very few friends and even with my partner. Yes, I


1370
01:08:32.300 --> 01:08:34.000
do communicate with my partner a lot.


1371
01:08:35.500 --> 01:08:38.200
Um, but it doesn't that's because


1372
01:08:38.200 --> 01:08:40.900
my descendant is sitting there so actually doesn't help either.


1373
01:08:41.700 --> 01:08:44.600
But you get the point. It does become very difficult. Especially when


1374
01:08:44.600 --> 01:08:47.200
you're talking about half of this deck in is sitting in


1375
01:08:47.200 --> 01:08:50.200
here, which I think is more what you're talking about in half of this deck and sitting over


1376
01:08:50.200 --> 01:08:53.200
here again, the last


1377
01:08:53.200 --> 01:08:56.800
like two minutes of me rambling about my chart proves why


1378
01:08:56.800 --> 01:09:00.300
it can be difficult for some people who resonate


1379
01:08:59.300 --> 01:09:02.700
with their placitas over their whole


1380
01:09:02.700 --> 01:09:04.400
science because some of the things I just said,


1381
01:09:06.600 --> 01:09:09.300
Um, you know, like I said my descendants to the seventh house is really I shouldn't have


1382
01:09:09.300 --> 01:09:12.400
used that but you know, I could use the 12th house twelve houses,


1383
01:09:12.400 --> 01:09:15.600
you know, my the themes of creativity and


1384
01:09:15.600 --> 01:09:17.600
spirituality is Pluto is transformation.


1385
01:09:19.300 --> 01:09:22.600
Again, I can't do much my freaking North Node.


1386
01:09:23.400 --> 01:09:26.100
Second house of making money. Sorry is sitting here


1387
01:09:26.100 --> 01:09:29.300
in the Mercury Deccan. So


1388
01:09:29.300 --> 01:09:32.400
this is all Pure Energy here for making money.


1389
01:09:33.500 --> 01:09:36.200
And you know it it just it


1390
01:09:36.200 --> 01:09:39.600
doesn't sit there as like I'm not organized with money at


1391
01:09:39.600 --> 01:09:42.300
all actually and that's that a lot


1392
01:09:42.300 --> 01:09:45.300
has to do with this here. I haven't I have


1393
01:09:45.300 --> 01:09:48.600
an in conjunct here with my Venus and my Saturn


1394
01:09:48.600 --> 01:09:51.900
that is far more important than this


1395
01:09:51.900 --> 01:09:54.500
sitting right here because this is actually a lie.


1396
01:09:54.500 --> 01:09:57.700
I am not organized with money. This aspect takes


1397
01:09:57.700 --> 01:10:00.400
over but my second house of how I make money


1398
01:10:00.400 --> 01:10:03.600
is not always through service to others although again


1399
01:10:03.600 --> 01:10:06.300
up here my phoenixes and


1400
01:10:06.300 --> 01:10:09.100
the the Virgo decking so


1401
01:10:09.100 --> 01:10:13.000
the way I debunked it earlier is the best way because


1402
01:10:12.200 --> 01:10:15.300
now every time I pick something it's


1403
01:10:15.300 --> 01:10:18.300
not it's shown somewhere else, right? But like


1404
01:10:18.300 --> 01:10:21.200
I said, where's my video games? Where are my


1405
01:10:21.200 --> 01:10:24.900
video games? Where are they at? They're gone video games


1406
01:10:24.900 --> 01:10:27.100
are such a staple still is a staple. We


1407
01:10:27.100 --> 01:10:30.300
have two video game stations in our house because


1408
01:10:30.300 --> 01:10:33.100
video games are super important and we're starting a gaming company.


1409
01:10:33.900 --> 01:10:36.800
So it this this is gone anyway


1410
01:10:36.800 --> 01:10:39.300
moving on but yes, you are absolutely right


1411
01:10:39.300 --> 01:10:43.000
is extremely confusing for no freaking reason in placidus.


1412
01:10:44.200 --> 01:10:47.600
Exactly was talking about coming Midway at the start of house. Yeah, I mean classes


1413
01:10:47.600 --> 01:10:47.800
just


1414
01:10:49.200 --> 01:10:52.300
I always like the idea that we all had different cusps for our


1415
01:10:52.300 --> 01:10:55.200
houses. But then once you put it


1416
01:10:55.200 --> 01:10:58.100
into practice, it really doesn't matter because all the aspects all the


1417
01:10:58.100 --> 01:11:01.600
placements all the ruler ships, you know that matters more.


1418
01:11:01.600 --> 01:11:04.200
So let me get into this. This is like I said


1419
01:11:04.200 --> 01:11:07.700
the meat and potatoes. This is the bulk of it. This is how you start interpreting.


1420
01:11:07.700 --> 01:11:10.500
And this is we're not interpreting much in this


1421
01:11:10.500 --> 01:11:13.700
class. That's gonna be the next the next


1422
01:11:13.700 --> 01:11:16.600
one the one after but these are the foundations so


1423
01:11:16.600 --> 01:11:19.700
that you're gonna get a step closer to being able to actually interpret something


1424
01:11:19.700 --> 01:11:22.200
so it's not just memory here, but we have


1425
01:11:22.200 --> 01:11:26.400
the sun. I just wanted to show you the relationship astronomically of


1426
01:11:25.400 --> 01:11:28.200
the planets because it's extremely important


1427
01:11:28.200 --> 01:11:29.900
and people who talk about


1428
01:11:31.500 --> 01:11:34.400
Orbs of influence which is what we're about to get into do not


1429
01:11:34.400 --> 01:11:37.500
talk about this in orbs of influences. One of the most important things


1430
01:11:37.500 --> 01:11:39.900
in my opinion when it comes to


1431
01:11:42.300 --> 01:11:45.600
To actually reading a chart. I have


1432
01:11:45.600 --> 01:11:48.300
a lot of things rulerships being one, but orbs of influence being


1433
01:11:48.300 --> 01:11:51.400
another the sun is huge. But it's


1434
01:11:51.400 --> 01:11:54.500
also not a dense. It's a


1435
01:11:54.500 --> 01:11:57.400
fireball it's not that so it acts a little bit differently. It


1436
01:11:57.400 --> 01:12:00.300
pulsates a bit more. So the sun kind of


1437
01:12:00.300 --> 01:12:04.300
does this a bit more than the other planets, but the


1438
01:12:03.300 --> 01:12:06.000
sun is huge. It's the biggest planet.


1439
01:12:06.900 --> 01:12:09.600
Obviously it's a star but in astrology it


1440
01:12:09.600 --> 01:12:12.400
is a planet. The Moon is also a planet and


1441
01:12:12.400 --> 01:12:15.300
astrology. We know that it's not it's a satellite.


1442
01:12:16.300 --> 01:12:19.300
But the sun's huge it is the biggest one has the biggest orb of


1443
01:12:19.300 --> 01:12:22.200
influence, but I wanted to show you the relationship of the sizes. Here's


1444
01:12:22.200 --> 01:12:25.500
the Earth and I put the moon because the moon's in


1445
01:12:25.500 --> 01:12:28.300
here the moon in Pluto are roughly


1446
01:12:28.300 --> 01:12:31.300
the same size. I can't remember which one's bigger. I almost want


1447
01:12:31.300 --> 01:12:34.200
to say. The Moon is bigger, but moon in Pluto are roughly the


1448
01:12:34.200 --> 01:12:34.500
same size.


1449
01:12:36.600 --> 01:12:39.500
You see Pluto back here. You see the difference between Pluto and


1450
01:12:39.500 --> 01:12:42.500
Neptune and Uranus and then you see the size difference


1451
01:12:42.500 --> 01:12:44.900
between Saturn and Jupiter here.


1452
01:12:45.700 --> 01:12:48.500
And how they play out, right so Mercury Venus


1453
01:12:48.500 --> 01:12:50.100
Mars. Here's your little


1454
01:12:50.700 --> 01:12:51.000
You know.


1455
01:12:52.200 --> 01:12:55.000
Pictogram or whatever this is right and I just wanted to show you


1456
01:12:55.200 --> 01:12:58.100
this because when we talk about orbs of influence think to the size of


1457
01:12:58.100 --> 01:13:01.800
the planet think to how close the planet is to us because


1458
01:13:01.800 --> 01:13:04.300
that is basically why the orbs of


1459
01:13:04.300 --> 01:13:05.500
influence work the way they do.


1460
01:13:06.500 --> 01:13:09.900
Let's just get right into it here. They are. I just


1461
01:13:09.900 --> 01:13:12.200
these are arbitrary. These are


1462
01:13:12.200 --> 01:13:15.400
what I currently use and as I study more


1463
01:13:15.400 --> 01:13:16.100
and more and more.


1464
01:13:16.800 --> 01:13:19.800
They're fairly accurate, but I know that they're


1465
01:13:19.800 --> 01:13:23.000
not perfectly accurate and I'm still determining what


1466
01:13:22.200 --> 01:13:25.900
the exact is. But from this point,


1467
01:13:25.900 --> 01:13:28.400
I think they're important to know but just


1468
01:13:28.400 --> 01:13:32.000
to understand that I might be a little off with some of these but


1469
01:13:31.400 --> 01:13:34.200
basically these are what I use when I'm talking


1470
01:13:34.200 --> 01:13:37.300
about it. So Mercury this I'm


1471
01:13:37.300 --> 01:13:40.700
sorry the sun 8 to 10 degrees. It's a huge orb


1472
01:13:40.700 --> 01:13:44.200
of influence and we're talking about orbs influence. We're talking about both directions.


1473
01:13:43.200 --> 01:13:46.500
So it's it's technically 16 to


1474
01:13:46.500 --> 01:13:47.900
20 degrees from


1475
01:13:49.300 --> 01:13:52.300
like for the entire span, but when we're talking about orbs of


1476
01:13:52.300 --> 01:13:57.100
influence, we're talking about from the degree in IH each


1477
01:13:55.100 --> 01:13:59.200
either direction here.


1478
01:14:01.300 --> 01:14:04.300
So the Mercury is two to three Venus five


1479
01:14:04.300 --> 01:14:08.000
to six. The Moon is two to three degrees and these are for


1480
01:14:07.400 --> 01:14:10.400
natal and Transit as


1481
01:14:10.400 --> 01:14:10.400
well.


1482
01:14:11.300 --> 01:14:14.000
Three to four for Mars seven and eight for Saturn and


1483
01:14:14.800 --> 01:14:18.400
Jupiter Uranus and Neptune three to five four


1484
01:14:17.400 --> 01:14:20.400
ish for Neptune and then


1485
01:14:20.400 --> 01:14:23.200
two to three degrees and it might even be less


1486
01:14:23.200 --> 01:14:23.900
for Pluto.


1487
01:14:24.800 --> 01:14:27.800
I've noticed that Pluto kind of dips in it's interesting


1488
01:14:27.800 --> 01:14:30.600
Pluto how Pluto plays out but these


1489
01:14:30.600 --> 01:14:32.400
are the orbs influence. Like I said, you'll have this.


1490
01:14:33.500 --> 01:14:36.200
I find it so fascinating when I look


1491
01:14:36.200 --> 01:14:40.100
up orbs of influence that the some.


1492
01:14:41.300 --> 01:14:44.200
Some websites have the Sun at like five degrees.


1493
01:14:45.100 --> 01:14:48.200
And or Saturn at five degrees and I know for a fact


1494
01:14:48.200 --> 01:14:51.700
that it's about seven and a half degrees, but the five


1495
01:14:51.700 --> 01:14:54.900
degrees and like I looked at my Saturn return right before


1496
01:14:54.900 --> 01:14:59.200
this class actually and looked at what time


1497
01:14:58.200 --> 01:15:01.100
in my Saturn return


1498
01:15:01.100 --> 01:15:04.900
would have five degrees been and nothing was


1499
01:15:04.900 --> 01:15:06.500
happening at that point. That would have been


1500
01:15:07.500 --> 01:15:10.200
a start of a sat at return like not


1501
01:15:10.200 --> 01:15:13.300
there wasn't I was already in it. It was clear that I was already in


1502
01:15:13.300 --> 01:15:14.600
a survive degrees is clearly wrong.


1503
01:15:15.500 --> 01:15:18.400
I've seen them all the way up to like the Sun at 15 to


1504
01:15:18.400 --> 01:15:21.600
20 degrees. I'm just like that means it's always spanning


1505
01:15:21.600 --> 01:15:24.900
between multiple houses if that were the truth. So this is


1506
01:15:24.900 --> 01:15:27.600
what I use when I do my readings it's been pretty accurate


1507
01:15:27.600 --> 01:15:30.500
up to this point, but I know that I can get this even better even


1508
01:15:30.500 --> 01:15:30.900
closer.


1509
01:15:32.600 --> 01:15:35.500
Taylor what if for example Mercury is in Saturn's or


1510
01:15:35.500 --> 01:15:38.300
of influence, but Saturn is not you think like


1511
01:15:38.300 --> 01:15:42.700
me is not in Mercury's does it work like that? So Saturn


1512
01:15:41.700 --> 01:15:44.900
will be influencing Mercury Mercury


1513
01:15:44.900 --> 01:15:47.200
will not be influencing Saturns the way I've seen


1514
01:15:47.200 --> 01:15:50.200
it now, I'm still testing that's a theory of mind that I've


1515
01:15:50.200 --> 01:15:53.800
been working on of if Saturn's energy


1516
01:15:53.800 --> 01:15:56.800
is reaching into Mercury's does mercury


1517
01:15:56.800 --> 01:15:57.800
somehow reach in


1518
01:15:59.400 --> 01:16:02.700
and it only reaches in the way that I've seen it as


1519
01:16:02.700 --> 01:16:04.200
far as Okay, so


1520
01:16:06.100 --> 01:16:09.500
How do I best explain this visually, I don't have a visual for this question because it's


1521
01:16:09.500 --> 01:16:10.000
popped up now.


1522
01:16:12.100 --> 01:16:15.700
So if Saturn's orb of influences here and it's reaching Mercury


1523
01:16:15.700 --> 01:16:18.800
and Mercury is here, then this is Saturn without


1524
01:16:18.800 --> 01:16:21.600
Mercury. And then this is Saturn with Mercury. Both


1525
01:16:21.600 --> 01:16:24.700
of them are influenced in this area. I hope


1526
01:16:24.700 --> 01:16:25.600
that makes sense to you.


1527
01:16:28.200 --> 01:16:32.300
But it Mercury would not be fully aspecting or


1528
01:16:31.300 --> 01:16:34.700
influencing rather all of Saturn.


1529
01:16:35.700 --> 01:16:38.400
Saturn would be influencing which is extremely important


1530
01:16:38.400 --> 01:16:39.800
to understand too because as


1531
01:16:40.600 --> 01:16:43.200
the planets do have different speeds. So as one comes up


1532
01:16:43.200 --> 01:16:46.300
on the other one Saturn's actually reaching out to


1533
01:16:46.300 --> 01:16:50.100
Mercury as mercury is coming along in a Transit before


1534
01:16:49.100 --> 01:16:52.600
Mercury can impact anything that Saturns doing


1535
01:16:52.600 --> 01:16:55.300
so Sanders actually putting restrictions on Mercury before


1536
01:16:55.300 --> 01:16:58.200
Mercury can get there and tell Saturn. What's the what?


1537
01:16:59.100 --> 01:17:00.700
So that's how that kind of plays out.


1538
01:17:03.200 --> 01:17:06.500
Not this this. Okay. So that's this and then


1539
01:17:06.500 --> 01:17:10.200
this is kind of I just wanted to do a quick visual of


1540
01:17:09.200 --> 01:17:12.000
what these would look like.


1541
01:17:12.200 --> 01:17:14.000
Right? So like I said, it's not


1542
01:17:15.100 --> 01:17:18.200
It's not the total. So when we're talking about the moon two to three


1543
01:17:18.200 --> 01:17:21.700
degrees is not all of it. It's from the center point. So moon is


1544
01:17:21.700 --> 01:17:23.800
sitting here. What was its 10 degrees ish?


1545
01:17:24.200 --> 01:17:27.900
10 degrees here two to three degrees this way two to


1546
01:17:27.900 --> 01:17:28.700
three degrees this way.


1547
01:17:29.500 --> 01:17:32.200
Jupiter same thing seven and a half to eight degrees


1548
01:17:32.200 --> 01:17:35.100
seven and a half day degrees this way seven and a half to eight


1549
01:17:35.100 --> 01:17:36.800
degrees this way. So you're talking about


1550
01:17:38.300 --> 01:17:39.600
15 to


1551
01:17:41.400 --> 01:17:43.300
15 to 16 degrees total


1552
01:17:44.600 --> 01:17:47.400
But all we care about is the orb of influence this side


1553
01:17:47.400 --> 01:17:50.000
and then this side so as this will be


1554
01:17:50.100 --> 01:17:52.400
in the next class, but as transits are coming up.


1555
01:17:53.200 --> 01:17:56.600
As it's coming up here. It's called applying.


1556
01:17:57.800 --> 01:18:00.700
Meaning this planet is is applying its


1557
01:18:00.700 --> 01:18:03.200
energy onto Saturn or I'm


1558
01:18:03.200 --> 01:18:06.100
sorry. I don't want to Jupiter and as it hits here, it's a direct


1559
01:18:06.100 --> 01:18:09.500
conjunction. And then as it passes forward, it's it is separating


1560
01:18:09.500 --> 01:18:12.200
meaning it's losing its influence Mercury is taking


1561
01:18:12.200 --> 01:18:16.000
the lead and when I discuss aspects, that's


1562
01:18:15.300 --> 01:18:18.300
another thing that nobody talks about which is


1563
01:18:18.300 --> 01:18:22.000
a is a applying and separating and why


1564
01:18:21.200 --> 01:18:25.300
that matters and the biggest. I


1565
01:18:24.300 --> 01:18:27.200
hope I remember to do this now that I'm announcing it,


1566
01:18:27.200 --> 01:18:30.300
but the biggest example that I can bring to


1567
01:18:30.300 --> 01:18:33.600
you is the great conjunction between Saturn and


1568
01:18:33.600 --> 01:18:36.000
Jupiter a couple years ago.


1569
01:18:37.300 --> 01:18:40.700
And why once that conjunction actually happened it


1570
01:18:40.700 --> 01:18:43.300
got easier even though they were within each other's orb of


1571
01:18:43.300 --> 01:18:46.700
influence. It's because Jupiter began to take the lead. So


1572
01:18:46.700 --> 01:18:49.300
Jupiter actually had the say


1573
01:18:49.300 --> 01:18:52.200
over what happened and then its energy spilled back


1574
01:18:52.200 --> 01:18:55.200
into Saturn even the Saturn was reaching reaching out


1575
01:18:55.200 --> 01:18:56.100
for Jupiter.


1576
01:18:56.900 --> 01:18:57.400
timing


1577
01:18:58.300 --> 01:18:59.100
Direction


1578
01:19:00.200 --> 01:19:01.800
and placement matter


1579
01:19:02.600 --> 01:19:05.700
and nobody talks about it again. Another reason


1580
01:19:05.700 --> 01:19:08.500
why I developed this system because it


1581
01:19:08.500 --> 01:19:11.300
matters when we come over here and we


1582
01:19:11.300 --> 01:19:12.300
look at my third house.


1583
01:19:13.700 --> 01:19:15.800
For instance not in plastis. Ew.


1584
01:19:16.700 --> 01:19:19.200
Get that out of here. We look at my third house


1585
01:19:19.200 --> 01:19:23.200
here again. I'll be talking about this more later. You'll


1586
01:19:22.200 --> 01:19:25.200
notice none of these planets are


1587
01:19:25.200 --> 01:19:26.400
within an orb of influence.


1588
01:19:27.300 --> 01:19:30.400
All right. This means that these planets are


1589
01:19:30.400 --> 01:19:33.100
not a stellium. I forgot to do it a slide on that


1590
01:19:33.100 --> 01:19:36.400
but these are not a stellium three planets in the same side


1591
01:19:36.400 --> 01:19:39.100
in the same sign rather are not a


1592
01:19:39.100 --> 01:19:39.800
stallion.


1593
01:19:40.700 --> 01:19:42.800
These are called a satellitium because


1594
01:19:44.100 --> 01:19:47.300
Mars's four degrees would put it at nine.


1595
01:19:48.200 --> 01:19:51.900
Saturn's 15 plus 7 or minus


1596
01:19:51.900 --> 01:19:54.700
seven. I guess we'll put it at eight so it could


1597
01:19:54.700 --> 01:19:57.800
be argued that there's a tiny overlap


1598
01:19:57.800 --> 01:19:58.600
over there.


1599
01:19:59.500 --> 01:20:01.400
But very nominal.


1600
01:20:02.300 --> 01:20:05.600
And then but it it reaching out by itself. It


1601
01:20:05.600 --> 01:20:08.200
doesn't reach any and then Pluto being two to


1602
01:20:08.200 --> 01:20:11.800
three degrees definitely doesn't reach any of them. So these are


1603
01:20:11.800 --> 01:20:14.700
not a stellium. They are a satellitium and


1604
01:20:14.700 --> 01:20:17.700
a satellitium is a cluster of of planets


1605
01:20:17.700 --> 01:20:20.800
within the same sign that do not impact each other and that's


1606
01:20:20.800 --> 01:20:23.300
extremely important to know with orb of influence. That's how


1607
01:20:23.300 --> 01:20:26.600
we know the difference between a stellium and a satellitium


1608
01:20:26.600 --> 01:20:29.100
a stellium is there much closer


1609
01:20:30.200 --> 01:20:33.100
this we wouldn't normally count vertex a Lilith and


1610
01:20:35.300 --> 01:20:39.000
And Neptune here, but 29 almost 26 degrees.


1611
01:20:38.400 --> 01:20:42.200
This would be a stellium if it were planets because


1612
01:20:41.200 --> 01:20:44.400
they're within each other's orb of influence there


1613
01:20:44.400 --> 01:20:47.500
are cluster and they work with each other and they change each


1614
01:20:47.500 --> 01:20:50.500
other's energy over here. They don't


1615
01:20:50.500 --> 01:20:53.200
change each other's energy in a satellitium. They work


1616
01:20:53.200 --> 01:20:56.900
independently within the same energy or same area of life. And


1617
01:20:56.900 --> 01:21:00.200
for me, I can tell you that when it comes to communication identity


1618
01:20:59.200 --> 01:21:01.600
and trying things out.


1619
01:21:02.600 --> 01:21:05.500
Taking action on something especially within


1620
01:21:05.500 --> 01:21:08.400
my own business. It is always try it test it.


1621
01:21:09.800 --> 01:21:12.400
It doesn't work start over to try


1622
01:21:12.400 --> 01:21:15.700
it test it change it. Try it test it change it buy something


1623
01:21:15.700 --> 01:21:18.500
because third house of sales buy something.


1624
01:21:18.500 --> 01:21:21.800
Try it out go get the return policy. It


1625
01:21:21.800 --> 01:21:24.200
always plays out like this in my life always.


1626
01:21:25.100 --> 01:21:26.100
So that's important to know.


1627
01:21:28.500 --> 01:21:32.300
So definitely look at the number for how close they are. It's the first number.


1628
01:21:31.300 --> 01:21:34.400
Yes. So when you're looking at the


1629
01:21:34.400 --> 01:21:37.100
let me throw it back here when you're looking


1630
01:21:37.100 --> 01:21:40.100
at the degrees. This is the degree. This is


1631
01:21:40.100 --> 01:21:43.500
the minutes and it goes to 60 minutes, right? So


1632
01:21:44.800 --> 01:21:47.400
You can't do 5.56. But you


1633
01:21:47.400 --> 01:21:50.500
have to know that this is this is basically six degrees.


1634
01:21:51.300 --> 01:21:56.000
So you don't just look at the five you look at the whole thing 5.56 which


1635
01:21:55.300 --> 01:21:58.700
isn't how you'd read it but five five whatever five


1636
01:21:58.700 --> 01:22:01.400
six is four minutes from


1637
01:22:01.400 --> 01:22:04.700
six degrees. So it is basically six


1638
01:22:04.700 --> 01:22:07.700
degrees 1532 is basically 15 and


1639
01:22:07.700 --> 01:22:10.900
a half degrees 24 and a


1640
01:22:10.900 --> 01:22:12.500
quarter is how you would read these


1641
01:22:13.700 --> 01:22:16.200
And that's important because this is basically six degrees


1642
01:22:16.200 --> 01:22:19.600
not five. If you read it as five you could be a little off in


1643
01:22:19.600 --> 01:22:21.100
some of your calculations, but it's six degrees.


1644
01:22:23.500 --> 01:22:26.200
Cool, so that I don't have anything else over here


1645
01:22:26.200 --> 01:22:30.400
for you. So here's what we're going to do. We're gonna talk about rulership's


1646
01:22:29.400 --> 01:22:32.300
and instead of using my chart.


1647
01:22:33.300 --> 01:22:36.400
I am going to go create a random person's chart


1648
01:22:36.400 --> 01:22:39.500
here random person. Let's make it female.


1649
01:22:40.700 --> 01:22:43.100
Let's say they were born. When do I


1650
01:22:43.100 --> 01:22:43.400
never use?


1651
01:22:47.600 --> 01:22:51.100
Mmm, March 22nd is popping in my head 1977. I


1652
01:22:50.100 --> 01:22:53.200
like twos and sevens that works and let's


1653
01:22:53.200 --> 01:22:54.600
just say they were born at


1654
01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:56.300
four


1655
01:22:59.500 --> 01:23:01.000
14 sure


1656
01:23:02.200 --> 01:23:04.700
and let's say they were born most you guys are in the states.


1657
01:23:11.400 --> 01:23:14.500
No, it's it's you see


1658
01:23:14.500 --> 01:23:17.200
Melissa you say I think I think I might


1659
01:23:17.200 --> 01:23:20.400
not be a leader. Oh in your chart. Okay. Yeah, you'd


1660
01:23:20.400 --> 01:23:23.400
have to look at the degrees to see


1661
01:23:23.400 --> 01:23:26.300
if it's a stallion or satellitium. Let's use some


1662
01:23:27.100 --> 01:23:29.700
Someplace, what's popping in my head?


1663
01:23:30.800 --> 01:23:34.500
Pittsburgh place


1664
01:23:33.500 --> 01:23:36.000
I would never want to live.


1665
01:23:36.700 --> 01:23:37.900
Sorry, if anybody lives there.


1666
01:23:39.600 --> 01:23:42.300
Let's just use this random here. We're still at whole


1667
01:23:42.300 --> 01:23:44.600
signs random person and let's show the chart.


1668
01:23:45.700 --> 01:23:46.600
Let's see what we got here.


1669
01:23:47.900 --> 01:23:50.400
Cool. All right. So we're looking at this person's chart


1670
01:23:50.400 --> 01:23:53.400
never seen it before because I literally just picked random numbers


1671
01:23:53.400 --> 01:23:56.100
and whatnot. We can see this person is an aquarius Rising.


1672
01:23:56.800 --> 01:23:59.700
This is what I want to talk about is while we're


1673
01:23:59.700 --> 01:24:02.200
not going to interpret this person's chart here. I do


1674
01:24:02.200 --> 01:24:06.400
want to talk about the fact that people look astrologers


1675
01:24:05.400 --> 01:24:08.200
textbooks whatnot. We'll look at


1676
01:24:08.200 --> 01:24:09.400
rulerships one way.


1677
01:24:10.400 --> 01:24:13.100
And I do two things one is I do


1678
01:24:13.100 --> 01:24:15.900
what's called bidirectional rulership.


1679
01:24:16.600 --> 01:24:19.700
And the other thing is I do layered rulership and I


1680
01:24:19.700 --> 01:24:22.600
think both of those are extremely important. So the


1681
01:24:22.600 --> 01:24:23.600
first one is this


1682
01:24:24.600 --> 01:24:27.600
let's say we want to understand the energy


1683
01:24:27.600 --> 01:24:29.900
surrounding how this person makes money.


1684
01:24:30.600 --> 01:24:33.700
Now this person here makes money


1685
01:24:33.700 --> 01:24:34.000
doing.


1686
01:24:35.900 --> 01:24:38.400
Pisces and things now without any


1687
01:24:38.400 --> 01:24:39.500
further context


1688
01:24:40.300 --> 01:24:43.500
Pisces and things from the first class could be musical could


1689
01:24:43.500 --> 01:24:46.300
be spiritual could be things that they do behind the scenes could


1690
01:24:46.300 --> 01:24:49.600
be media related as in pictures video film


1691
01:24:49.600 --> 01:24:50.300
things like that.


1692
01:24:51.200 --> 01:24:54.700
And I can't remember what I just said. So if I didn't say musical or medical


1693
01:24:55.500 --> 01:24:57.900
Right. So those are the main things and


1694
01:24:59.200 --> 01:25:02.400
the condition of the second house being Pisces means that


1695
01:25:02.400 --> 01:25:06.000
money naturally flows. It comes


1696
01:25:05.300 --> 01:25:08.700
and goes in this person may not have a


1697
01:25:08.700 --> 01:25:11.500
very either a very good relationship with


1698
01:25:11.500 --> 01:25:14.100
money or they may have found that in their


1699
01:25:14.100 --> 01:25:17.100
life money kind of escapes them.


1700
01:25:17.100 --> 01:25:20.300
It slips. There's not a lot of money in this person's life.


1701
01:25:20.300 --> 01:25:23.300
That's the that's what's going on in my head when


1702
01:25:23.300 --> 01:25:26.400
I first read it, but that is not all of


1703
01:25:26.400 --> 01:25:26.900
the information.


1704
01:25:28.200 --> 01:25:31.500
So when you're reading charts you have to realize that there are rulerships.


1705
01:25:32.600 --> 01:25:35.200
And there are reverse rulership's I'm going


1706
01:25:35.200 --> 01:25:38.400
to go through rulerships first. So Pisces here


1707
01:25:38.400 --> 01:25:41.000
we talked about the first things that popped in my head.


1708
01:25:41.700 --> 01:25:42.700
Were what I just said.


1709
01:25:43.600 --> 01:25:46.500
but I need to know more I need to know even if


1710
01:25:46.500 --> 01:25:49.100
this were especially if this were an empty house, but I


1711
01:25:49.100 --> 01:25:52.600
know that Mars being in here means that this person actively


1712
01:25:53.800 --> 01:25:56.200
Pursues money, right? They do things


1713
01:25:56.200 --> 01:25:58.500
for money and they do it in this manner.


1714
01:25:59.100 --> 01:26:03.000
But I need to know more about their money. So I need to look at the rulership of


1715
01:26:02.900 --> 01:26:05.600
Pisces Pisces ruler is


1716
01:26:05.600 --> 01:26:08.400
Neptune. So I have to zoom out


1717
01:26:08.400 --> 01:26:12.500
and I have to go where is Neptune? Oh Neptune


1718
01:26:11.500 --> 01:26:14.600
up here on the 11th house. So the


1719
01:26:14.600 --> 01:26:15.500
first thing in my head


1720
01:26:16.600 --> 01:26:20.400
is that their money comes through 11th


1721
01:26:19.400 --> 01:26:22.500
house matters without diving


1722
01:26:22.500 --> 01:26:25.400
any deeper. This is the next stage next thought


1723
01:26:25.400 --> 01:26:29.700
11th house matters have to do with teams organizations groups


1724
01:26:29.700 --> 01:26:32.900
hopes and dreams humanitarianism friends


1725
01:26:32.900 --> 01:26:34.500
networking.


1726
01:26:38.700 --> 01:26:40.200
Think those are the main and Technology.


1727
01:26:41.200 --> 01:26:43.900
So I know that those are the areas of life that we're talking about.


1728
01:26:45.400 --> 01:26:48.100
Now I'm going to ignore the planets in the midheaven right now. I'm just going


1729
01:26:48.100 --> 01:26:51.300
to go to Sagittarius. So now I know


1730
01:26:51.300 --> 01:26:54.500
that those themes that we talked about 11th house


1731
01:26:54.500 --> 01:26:57.100
themes play out in this way. If it is


1732
01:26:57.100 --> 01:27:00.200
teams, it is International Teams, if it


1733
01:27:00.200 --> 01:27:03.400
is groups, it is cultural groups. If it


1734
01:27:03.400 --> 01:27:06.700
is technology it has to do with learning or education.


1735
01:27:07.700 --> 01:27:10.400
And you can play around with this in your head because you're dealing


1736
01:27:10.400 --> 01:27:13.700
with energy and remember that energy is not concrete. This


1737
01:27:13.700 --> 01:27:16.900
is what makes reading charts a little bit more intricate


1738
01:27:16.900 --> 01:27:19.300
a little bit more involved you need finesse and it's not


1739
01:27:19.300 --> 01:27:22.200
always straightforward because we have to know this is


1740
01:27:22.200 --> 01:27:24.900
why you want to commit what can these all mean?


1741
01:27:26.100 --> 01:27:28.500
Right, so I know that the way that they make money.


1742
01:27:29.300 --> 01:27:32.500
They do it through again. We're just going to retrace our


1743
01:27:32.500 --> 01:27:34.000
steps they do it through.


1744
01:27:35.100 --> 01:27:39.500
either hospitals film or


1745
01:27:38.500 --> 01:27:40.300
media


1746
01:27:41.700 --> 01:27:43.800
music behind the scenes


1747
01:27:44.800 --> 01:27:46.000
or something creative


1748
01:27:47.100 --> 01:27:48.200
or something spiritual


1749
01:27:49.500 --> 01:27:52.800
And those things have to do with culture now.


1750
01:27:52.800 --> 01:27:56.000
This is where and groups and in organizations


1751
01:27:55.600 --> 01:27:57.400
now they could


1752
01:27:58.300 --> 01:28:03.000
Make money through what is a spiritual group that


1753
01:28:02.400 --> 01:28:05.400
deals with culture politics or


1754
01:28:05.400 --> 01:28:06.000
religion?


1755
01:28:08.400 --> 01:28:08.800
Church


1756
01:28:10.200 --> 01:28:13.600
they could make money by doing something.


1757
01:28:13.600 --> 01:28:16.300
We haven't gotten to all the details doing something


1758
01:28:16.300 --> 01:28:17.800
spiritual.


1759
01:28:18.900 --> 01:28:19.600
religion


1760
01:28:20.300 --> 01:28:24.300
And belief groups or small organizations. And


1761
01:28:23.300 --> 01:28:26.100
again, we have it and then when I


1762
01:28:26.100 --> 01:28:29.300
bring this planet, so this person could be a pastor.


1763
01:28:29.300 --> 01:28:32.500
I haven't figured that out yet, but this person


1764
01:28:32.500 --> 01:28:33.800
could work for a church.


1765
01:28:34.800 --> 01:28:36.500
They could also be and it could be.


1766
01:28:37.300 --> 01:28:40.300
Like a Sunday school, it could be that they're teaching or


1767
01:28:40.300 --> 01:28:41.500
it could be that they're preaching.


1768
01:28:42.300 --> 01:28:43.200
So they could be either.


1769
01:28:44.100 --> 01:28:47.600
Now Neptune in here actually, I'm


1770
01:28:47.600 --> 01:28:51.000
not going to go to the planet yet. So that is that is


1771
01:28:50.900 --> 01:28:53.300
rulership's right. So we


1772
01:28:53.300 --> 01:28:56.400
looked at the second house. We saw the ruler. The ruler


1773
01:28:56.400 --> 01:28:59.500
is Neptune. Neptune is sitting up here and that


1774
01:28:59.500 --> 01:29:00.600
is in Sagittarius.


1775
01:29:02.100 --> 01:29:02.300
now


1776
01:29:03.800 --> 01:29:05.300
when I do a second layer.


1777
01:29:06.700 --> 01:29:08.400
I will then say I want to know.


1778
01:29:09.200 --> 01:29:12.800
The condition of the 11th house so we


1779
01:29:12.800 --> 01:29:15.200
know that the second house is is sitting up here in


1780
01:29:15.200 --> 01:29:19.000
the 11th house how they make money is through this. But


1781
01:29:18.100 --> 01:29:22.200
what is this? So then I go say Sagittarius ruler


1782
01:29:21.200 --> 01:29:24.400
is Jupiter and this is the second


1783
01:29:24.400 --> 01:29:24.900
layer.


1784
01:29:26.300 --> 01:29:29.100
So that is sitting down here. I found it in the


1785
01:29:29.100 --> 01:29:32.800
fourth house that fourth house has to do with home has


1786
01:29:32.800 --> 01:29:35.800
to do with nurturing has to do with agriculture has


1787
01:29:35.800 --> 01:29:37.300
to do with the mother family.


1788
01:29:38.300 --> 01:29:39.300
Could be real estate.


1789
01:29:43.700 --> 01:29:46.700
Those are the main things and then for home has


1790
01:29:46.700 --> 01:29:49.500
to do with Taurus Taurus themes


1791
01:29:49.500 --> 01:29:51.900
our money value self-worth.


1792
01:29:52.700 --> 01:29:53.700
Mother Nature


1793
01:29:54.800 --> 01:29:55.000
food


1794
01:29:58.400 --> 01:30:01.600
and money also equates to finance right? So I


1795
01:30:01.600 --> 01:30:04.500
know that the organization that we're


1796
01:30:04.500 --> 01:30:05.000
talking about.


1797
01:30:06.300 --> 01:30:08.000
Has to do with these themes.


1798
01:30:09.400 --> 01:30:12.300
So it could be a spiritual humanitarian could be


1799
01:30:12.300 --> 01:30:13.200
a church run.


1800
01:30:14.300 --> 01:30:15.300
like food shelter


1801
01:30:16.100 --> 01:30:19.100
Could be we haven't gotten all the details, but this is


1802
01:30:19.100 --> 01:30:21.400
how you work with layers. That is a double layer.


1803
01:30:22.300 --> 01:30:24.900
one to two two to three


1804
01:30:26.200 --> 01:30:29.100
to add more information. This is why I'm going to


1805
01:30:29.100 --> 01:30:32.200
keep going and I know you guys are going to be able to rewind this and watch again


1806
01:30:32.200 --> 01:30:33.500
to add more information.


1807
01:30:35.200 --> 01:30:38.100
Mars is sitting in the second house of money.


1808
01:30:40.200 --> 01:30:43.200
So when I'm looking here, we already know that Mars is


1809
01:30:43.200 --> 01:30:46.800
the planet of action. We know that this person has drive and passion towards


1810
01:30:47.600 --> 01:30:50.300
Second house matters and that it plays


1811
01:30:50.300 --> 01:30:53.200
out in piscian ways. Now it can


1812
01:30:53.200 --> 01:30:56.600
play out in an often does play out in a negative way or


1813
01:30:56.600 --> 01:30:59.200
in a very basic way because in order


1814
01:30:59.200 --> 01:31:03.100
to get to a higher vibration, which is the purpose of living we have


1815
01:31:02.100 --> 01:31:05.000
to use the energy harness it


1816
01:31:05.300 --> 01:31:08.900
and turn it into something. So when I read charts I always


1817
01:31:08.900 --> 01:31:10.600
go for the obvious.


1818
01:31:11.800 --> 01:31:12.900
And that's important as well.


1819
01:31:13.900 --> 01:31:14.900
Pisces is


1820
01:31:15.900 --> 01:31:18.500
things that end Illusions things


1821
01:31:18.500 --> 01:31:21.300
that aren't there compassion and compassion is


1822
01:31:21.300 --> 01:31:22.200
a good thing but


1823
01:31:23.400 --> 01:31:26.500
It's a very basic entry level to it


1824
01:31:26.500 --> 01:31:29.500
and compassion usually ends up being you


1825
01:31:29.500 --> 01:31:29.500
know.


1826
01:31:30.500 --> 01:31:33.900
The negative version is you you're too


1827
01:31:33.900 --> 01:31:34.400
compassionate.


1828
01:31:35.400 --> 01:31:38.200
So this person is obviously very compassionate but it


1829
01:31:38.200 --> 01:31:41.600
has to do with value money and they do they use


1830
01:31:41.600 --> 01:31:44.900
it, you know, they use this energy towards that but Mars


1831
01:31:44.900 --> 01:31:48.100
and we already know this information, but Mars rulership.


1832
01:31:48.900 --> 01:31:49.700
Go the other way.


1833
01:31:50.500 --> 01:31:52.600
What is Mars the ruler of?


1834
01:31:53.500 --> 01:31:56.800
Well, it's the ruler of Aries now. I don't have to go too


1835
01:31:56.800 --> 01:31:58.900
far. It's right here. It's in the third house.


1836
01:32:00.200 --> 01:32:03.200
So I know that all of this energy we talked about what they


1837
01:32:03.200 --> 01:32:06.700
did the type of place. They might work out how that


1838
01:32:06.700 --> 01:32:07.200
plays out.


1839
01:32:08.300 --> 01:32:11.200
What is it? That's actually what are they doing?


1840
01:32:11.200 --> 01:32:14.400
Because it's Mars doing action. Well, it


1841
01:32:14.400 --> 01:32:17.900
had it comes from the third house. Their third house always


1842
01:32:17.900 --> 01:32:20.600
feeds into the second house themes


1843
01:32:20.600 --> 01:32:23.500
because of the rulership, but we're talking about money, which is


1844
01:32:23.500 --> 01:32:26.200
a lens and I'll talk about lenses in another class more but


1845
01:32:27.100 --> 01:32:30.000
Just the quick version of it is and pretty much


1846
01:32:30.600 --> 01:32:33.700
really all I need to say is a lens is the topic that


1847
01:32:33.700 --> 01:32:36.800
we're talking about. So when I'm looking at Mars,


1848
01:32:36.800 --> 01:32:39.200
I'm not talking about romance. So I don't need to


1849
01:32:39.200 --> 01:32:41.500
know that Mars has to do with sex.


1850
01:32:42.500 --> 01:32:45.800
I need to know that has to do a passion and drive not romantic passion


1851
01:32:45.800 --> 01:32:48.400
because we're talking about money. Although I can keep that


1852
01:32:48.400 --> 01:32:51.100
in the back of my mind because it could have something to do


1853
01:32:51.100 --> 01:32:53.500
with the way that they do it. They could have a romantic.


1854
01:32:54.200 --> 01:32:57.500
Kind of like almost Sexual Energy towards making


1855
01:32:57.500 --> 01:32:59.300
money, but we'll come back to that.


1856
01:33:00.200 --> 01:33:04.000
Third house is sales communication siblings


1857
01:33:03.300 --> 01:33:06.900
close environments


1858
01:33:06.900 --> 01:33:09.900
neighbors cousins. That's all


1859
01:33:09.900 --> 01:33:12.400
the third house energy here. It's also your


1860
01:33:12.400 --> 01:33:15.300
identity. So this person's identity has to


1861
01:33:15.300 --> 01:33:16.400
do with making money.


1862
01:33:17.400 --> 01:33:19.800
or putting their action towards value


1863
01:33:21.200 --> 01:33:24.100
and then you see all of these planets and if you've


1864
01:33:24.100 --> 01:33:25.200
ever seen me do a live.


1865
01:33:25.900 --> 01:33:26.500
reading


1866
01:33:27.500 --> 01:33:30.400
or you see me do your personal readings? You know that when


1867
01:33:30.400 --> 01:33:31.200
I see all of this.


1868
01:33:32.200 --> 01:33:35.800
I'm like, all right, here we go. And what I'm doing is


1869
01:33:35.800 --> 01:33:38.500
I'm taking every single one of these planets and I'm


1870
01:33:38.500 --> 01:33:40.000
reverse engineering the planet.


1871
01:33:41.200 --> 01:33:44.200
I look at it. First. I say okay. So in the third house, we


1872
01:33:44.200 --> 01:33:47.300
know that children are fun or Recreation has


1873
01:33:47.300 --> 01:33:50.700
to be there needs to be something that makes you happy, you know, there's communication


1874
01:33:50.700 --> 01:33:53.200
involved here potentially structure and


1875
01:33:53.200 --> 01:33:54.700
or not structure but organization.


1876
01:33:55.700 --> 01:33:58.300
Service to others that this sales as


1877
01:33:58.300 --> 01:34:01.400
a service or this communication is a service that the


1878
01:34:01.400 --> 01:34:04.500
Venus here has to do with value and self-worth that


1879
01:34:04.500 --> 01:34:07.400
the South node which we won't talk about South near Chiron too


1880
01:34:07.400 --> 01:34:10.400
much here, but they they have implications as well. And obviously I skipped


1881
01:34:10.400 --> 01:34:13.600
over errors. So for the main things that I look at are


1882
01:34:13.600 --> 01:34:17.200
planets the main things you guys are going to look at our planets Sun


1883
01:34:16.200 --> 01:34:18.600
Mercury Venus.


1884
01:34:19.600 --> 01:34:22.500
We see venuses in retrograde at this time. So we


1885
01:34:22.500 --> 01:34:25.200
know that Venus is not going to operate in its normal


1886
01:34:25.200 --> 01:34:28.500
way. It's going to be internalized a bit but it's still


1887
01:34:28.500 --> 01:34:31.100
is of the same theme, so don't get hung up on


1888
01:34:31.100 --> 01:34:34.200
retrogrades come back to retrogrades when you need to get into


1889
01:34:34.200 --> 01:34:34.900
the details.


1890
01:34:36.500 --> 01:34:39.900
To understand the third house. I have to reverse engineer


1891
01:34:39.900 --> 01:34:43.200
it I have to know where Venus is Venus co-rules,


1892
01:34:42.200 --> 01:34:46.000
right Venus rules Taurus and


1893
01:34:45.600 --> 01:34:47.900
Venus rules Libra.


1894
01:34:48.600 --> 01:34:51.900
So I have to understand this house here where Libra


1895
01:34:51.900 --> 01:34:52.000
is.


1896
01:34:52.800 --> 01:34:55.900
Which I have another planet and then I have to understand the


1897
01:34:55.900 --> 01:34:58.200
fourth house. Now the fourth house we already


1898
01:34:58.200 --> 01:35:01.000
know is connected in so we have a little bit of


1899
01:35:01.200 --> 01:35:02.100
that work already done.


1900
01:35:04.200 --> 01:35:07.700
Then I need to understand Mercury again a co-ruler.


1901
01:35:08.300 --> 01:35:09.300
the fifth house


1902
01:35:10.100 --> 01:35:14.400
and then the eighth house so deep bonds Investments.


1903
01:35:16.900 --> 01:35:20.000
Shared resources and Virgo


1904
01:35:19.200 --> 01:35:22.500
is service to others or being critical. Those


1905
01:35:22.500 --> 01:35:24.800
are the main two ways that usually plays out or health.


1906
01:35:26.100 --> 01:35:28.900
And then we know that the third house here.


1907
01:35:30.800 --> 01:35:32.900
the Sun


1908
01:35:34.200 --> 01:35:36.400
Where to go is here with Saturn?


1909
01:35:36.900 --> 01:35:39.200
This actually makes it easier because I know


1910
01:35:39.200 --> 01:35:42.400
that the way that they make money in their Drive is connected directly


1911
01:35:42.400 --> 01:35:45.200
with their career and it has


1912
01:35:45.200 --> 01:35:48.600
to do with potentially owning their own business or something that


1913
01:35:48.600 --> 01:35:51.400
they deal directly with the public or something. They deal directly


1914
01:35:51.400 --> 01:35:54.500
one-on-one with somebody and it's of


1915
01:35:54.500 --> 01:35:56.900
Leo theme, so it's entertainment it is.


1916
01:36:00.300 --> 01:36:03.800
Entertainment it is drama. It is children. It


1917
01:36:03.800 --> 01:36:06.700
is something that's fun recreational


1918
01:36:06.700 --> 01:36:07.500
could be Sports.


1919
01:36:08.400 --> 01:36:10.100
So when you pull all this together.


1920
01:36:11.300 --> 01:36:14.400
And you're talking about Aries here Aries energy


1921
01:36:14.400 --> 01:36:17.500
in the third, which is again communication. So all of this


1922
01:36:17.500 --> 01:36:20.500
here when you pull it all together and you're


1923
01:36:20.500 --> 01:36:23.400
doing bi-directionality of rulership's meaning


1924
01:36:23.400 --> 01:36:24.600
you've gone forward.


1925
01:36:25.600 --> 01:36:28.100
You looked at the sign you said what's the ruler and we went


1926
01:36:28.100 --> 01:36:30.200
here even without going into the second layer.


1927
01:36:30.900 --> 01:36:33.400
And then you said there's a planet in there. What's it


1928
01:36:33.400 --> 01:36:35.300
the ruler of that's the other way.


1929
01:36:37.400 --> 01:36:40.600
So that's why ruler ships have to be done both


1930
01:36:40.600 --> 01:36:43.200
ways because it's not just Mars sitting in here. It's the


1931
01:36:43.200 --> 01:36:46.500
entire third house that is sitting in the second house. And that's


1932
01:36:46.500 --> 01:36:47.700
why it's so important here.


1933
01:36:48.900 --> 01:36:51.900
So we pull all this together has to do with media or


1934
01:36:51.900 --> 01:36:54.900
things behind the scene. So one of the ways with the midheaven in


1935
01:36:54.900 --> 01:36:57.600
Sagittarius could have


1936
01:36:57.600 --> 01:37:00.100
to do a travel could have to do with culture. There are a


1937
01:37:00.100 --> 01:37:03.500
lot of ways this can play out and we'd have to keep diving deeper to understand


1938
01:37:03.500 --> 01:37:07.100
where it is, but it definitely has to do with communication because Mercury


1939
01:37:06.100 --> 01:37:09.000
is sitting here in Aries. It has to


1940
01:37:09.200 --> 01:37:12.900
be their own way. They're sixth house of work has to do with nurturing and


1941
01:37:12.900 --> 01:37:14.700
it's down here and forth house, so


1942
01:37:15.700 --> 01:37:16.300
We know that.


1943
01:37:18.400 --> 01:37:21.400
And the 11th house is down here as well. We know


1944
01:37:21.400 --> 01:37:25.000
that this person is likely a teacher.


1945
01:37:26.100 --> 01:37:30.000
They're doing something their own way because you always factor in the ascendant. They're


1946
01:37:29.200 --> 01:37:32.800
doing something their own way. They're using technology. Again.


1947
01:37:32.800 --> 01:37:35.900
We have a double on the 11th House of Technology networking


1948
01:37:35.900 --> 01:37:39.100
and all of that. The ascendant


1949
01:37:38.100 --> 01:37:41.700
is at 10 degrees, which actually puts it into the


1950
01:37:41.700 --> 01:37:44.400
Gemini deck in again. This is why deccans are


1951
01:37:44.400 --> 01:37:46.200
so important because this gives us further information.


1952
01:37:47.400 --> 01:37:50.300
That it's not just like working Tech behind the scenes.


1953
01:37:50.300 --> 01:37:53.300
It actually has to do with communication here. And this


1954
01:37:53.300 --> 01:37:56.300
person could be somebody who works internationally.


1955
01:37:57.500 --> 01:37:58.900
Because this is home country as well.


1956
01:38:02.300 --> 01:38:05.900
Taurus Finance they could be somebody who works on the financial


1957
01:38:05.900 --> 01:38:06.700
aspect of


1958
01:38:07.700 --> 01:38:11.700
of working a a public


1959
01:38:10.700 --> 01:38:13.400
facing business or what I


1960
01:38:13.400 --> 01:38:16.500
see more is that they're in sports media of


1961
01:38:16.500 --> 01:38:17.000
some sort.


1962
01:38:18.100 --> 01:38:20.200
Sports media are digital media.


1963
01:38:21.300 --> 01:38:25.000
You put it all together. And obviously we have to look at everything but


1964
01:38:24.200 --> 01:38:27.500
I'm getting also here that there's a financial


1965
01:38:27.500 --> 01:38:31.100
aspect of it or there is a like a


1966
01:38:30.100 --> 01:38:33.200
home food. This is like this is


1967
01:38:33.200 --> 01:38:37.200
like doing the the sales for the Food Network is one


1968
01:38:36.200 --> 01:38:38.200
way that this can play out.


1969
01:38:41.300 --> 01:38:44.000
Now I don't have you guys in front to be like are there any questions?


1970
01:38:45.400 --> 01:38:48.500
but are there any questions I'm gonna jump into the Q&amp;A because


1971
01:38:48.500 --> 01:38:49.000
this is


1972
01:38:50.300 --> 01:38:53.600
I know that I'm gonna have to repeat some of this with the Q&amp;A in this


1973
01:38:53.600 --> 01:38:55.100
case does the rulership?


1974
01:38:56.100 --> 01:39:00.000
Deccan planets sun and Mars have more weight.


1975
01:39:01.200 --> 01:39:04.100
No, the deckons don't add weight. The deckons are


1976
01:39:04.100 --> 01:39:04.900
only a flavor.


1977
01:39:07.500 --> 01:39:10.300
Only flavor here. So when we're talking about the sun being


1978
01:39:10.300 --> 01:39:13.300
in Aries, it is in the Aries deck in


1979
01:39:13.300 --> 01:39:16.800
or the Mars deck in of Aries. So the sun is Aries


1980
01:39:16.800 --> 01:39:19.500
Aries in the third house for communication. So this


1981
01:39:19.500 --> 01:39:22.200
person is happiest when they're communicating the way


1982
01:39:22.200 --> 01:39:25.300
that they want to Mercury is also sitting at seven degrees in that first


1983
01:39:25.300 --> 01:39:28.800
deck in here. They're communicating the way that they want to over


1984
01:39:28.800 --> 01:39:32.100
things that they find valuable retrograde personally


1985
01:39:31.100 --> 01:39:33.100
valuable here.


1986
01:39:34.100 --> 01:39:37.800
Now Chiron obviously throws a wrench in some of this but if


1987
01:39:37.800 --> 01:39:40.100
they find a way to talk about things that are healing or


1988
01:39:40.100 --> 01:39:43.200
help other people with communication Chiron, the


1989
01:39:43.200 --> 01:39:46.500
third house could be an issue with their speech, but we're going


1990
01:39:46.500 --> 01:39:48.800
to ignore Chiron because that's a whole other class.


1991
01:39:50.800 --> 01:39:53.600
But you don't look at rulerships to decons. That's


1992
01:39:53.600 --> 01:39:54.400
not a thing.


1993
01:39:58.500 --> 01:40:01.200
How does all that energy in the third house


1994
01:40:01.200 --> 01:40:03.400
play out in the second house Taylor says.


1995
01:40:04.200 --> 01:40:07.700
So the third house ruler is


1996
01:40:07.700 --> 01:40:10.200
Mars and Mars is sitting in the


1997
01:40:10.200 --> 01:40:13.200
second house. So that literally means you take the


1998
01:40:13.200 --> 01:40:16.700
package the whole package of the third house and it


1999
01:40:16.700 --> 01:40:19.300
literally this all of this energy as you


2000
01:40:19.300 --> 01:40:22.200
as you you're welcome Angela as


2001
01:40:22.200 --> 01:40:22.400
you


2002
01:40:24.300 --> 01:40:27.500
examine it and figure out what all this how this third house


2003
01:40:27.500 --> 01:40:31.200
condition is all that third house energy applies to


2004
01:40:30.200 --> 01:40:33.300
their self-worth applies to


2005
01:40:33.300 --> 01:40:36.800
how they make money applies to the types


2006
01:40:36.800 --> 01:40:39.700
of foods that they like you just have to interpret energies


2007
01:40:39.700 --> 01:40:42.500
to make it make sense. Right? So all this


2008
01:40:42.500 --> 01:40:43.600
here is they they like


2009
01:40:44.400 --> 01:40:47.100
they like they probably like seafood spicy Seafood.


2010
01:40:48.300 --> 01:40:48.900
Is how I would get this.


2011
01:40:53.600 --> 01:40:54.100
cultural


2012
01:40:56.700 --> 01:40:58.700
spicy cultural Seafood, but it may not like them.


2013
01:40:59.700 --> 01:41:00.500
How did I get that?


2014
01:41:03.900 --> 01:41:04.400
so we have


2015
01:41:07.100 --> 01:41:10.800
I can't really get into aspects right now. But the seventh


2016
01:41:10.800 --> 01:41:13.400
house ruler of culture is sitting down here.


2017
01:41:13.400 --> 01:41:16.500
It's ruler as Venus and that's sitting


2018
01:41:16.500 --> 01:41:19.500
down here in the third house. So that's


2019
01:41:19.500 --> 01:41:22.200
the cultural food things that they like. This is


2020
01:41:22.200 --> 01:41:24.700
hot. So it spicy.


2021
01:41:25.500 --> 01:41:28.000
You know Aries will represent spicy in this


2022
01:41:28.200 --> 01:41:29.700
case hot fire Aries.


2023
01:41:30.300 --> 01:41:34.200
They like to talk about it. They like to eat it


2024
01:41:34.200 --> 01:41:37.100
specifically like to especially on a date


2025
01:41:37.100 --> 01:41:40.700
they have to communicate with their partner their romantic


2026
01:41:40.700 --> 01:41:43.700
partner what they can and can't eat and that


2027
01:41:43.700 --> 01:41:44.500
feeds into food.


2028
01:41:45.500 --> 01:41:48.900
Pisces represents the water so seafood and


2029
01:41:48.900 --> 01:41:49.500
then because


2030
01:41:50.700 --> 01:41:53.600
Jupiter and we're not here yet. But Jupiter is


2031
01:41:53.600 --> 01:41:56.900
making a semi-sex style to Chiron and


2032
01:41:56.900 --> 01:41:59.600
Chiron is there as well? It's like they really like


2033
01:41:59.600 --> 01:42:02.300
cultural Cuisine, but they


2034
01:42:02.300 --> 01:42:04.000
they can eat it.


2035
01:42:14.400 --> 01:42:17.500
Once I started interpreted interpreting the


2036
01:42:17.500 --> 01:42:21.300
third house. I forgot what I was originally money


2037
01:42:20.300 --> 01:42:23.300
income what your interpreting


2038
01:42:23.300 --> 01:42:23.800
originally


2039
01:42:24.600 --> 01:42:25.300
yeah, so


2040
01:42:27.200 --> 01:42:30.000
this this will come with practice is.


2041
01:42:32.400 --> 01:42:35.400
You can also take it. You can also take it one


2042
01:42:35.400 --> 01:42:38.000
at a time right I do it collectively but you could


2043
01:42:38.200 --> 01:42:40.400
take it one of the time problem with doing it one at a time. Is that


2044
01:42:41.900 --> 01:42:44.100
It makes it difficult. Now, you got to realize again we didn't


2045
01:42:44.100 --> 01:42:47.400
get to aspects but the thing they're communication


2046
01:42:47.400 --> 01:42:50.600
and things they like to talk about they they tend


2047
01:42:50.600 --> 01:42:53.900
not to be able to to make


2048
01:42:53.900 --> 01:42:56.300
money the way that they want based on what's happy they


2049
01:42:56.300 --> 01:42:59.300
have to resolve this semi-sexstyle you see Sun at


2050
01:42:59.300 --> 01:43:00.900
one degree Mars at one degree.


2051
01:43:01.800 --> 01:43:04.000
This creates an agitation when we


2052
01:43:04.200 --> 01:43:07.900
do aspects in the next class. We're going to be talking about 30 degree because again,


2053
01:43:07.900 --> 01:43:10.600
nobody talks about this and it's so freaking important


2054
01:43:10.600 --> 01:43:13.500
and so we're Queen kunk's which are in conjunctions.


2055
01:43:13.500 --> 01:43:16.300
I'll be talking about those a lot


2056
01:43:16.300 --> 01:43:20.100
because they're important but this is all like they


2057
01:43:19.100 --> 01:43:22.200
they would have to be a sales rep


2058
01:43:22.200 --> 01:43:25.300
without being a sales rep because the Pisces energy is


2059
01:43:25.300 --> 01:43:28.800
like it'll just lead to nothing. If they try to force that Aries


2060
01:43:28.800 --> 01:43:31.200
energy out there. They have to use the Aries energy


2061
01:43:31.200 --> 01:43:34.200
within Pisces and not come across as doing this.


2062
01:43:35.500 --> 01:43:38.600
So they'll have to really connect with groups. They'll


2063
01:43:38.600 --> 01:43:41.500
really have to be teaching and inspiring as


2064
01:43:41.500 --> 01:43:44.000
opposed to you know selling.


2065
01:43:44.800 --> 01:43:47.400
That's how you would read. This this isn't working. So where's


2066
01:43:47.400 --> 01:43:50.200
the ruler you always look within the same energies. This is


2067
01:43:50.200 --> 01:43:54.100
what we have to do. I got to teach teach compassionately


2068
01:43:53.100 --> 01:43:56.600
basically is what they have to do. So as


2069
01:43:56.600 --> 01:43:59.200
a sales rep if they were ever to get into a sales job.


2070
01:44:00.200 --> 01:44:03.300
They would have to be they would have to know this energy to be


2071
01:44:03.300 --> 01:44:06.200
a better sales rep because they're clearly good at sales.


2072
01:44:06.200 --> 01:44:10.000
They they have insecurities here, but their


2073
01:44:09.200 --> 01:44:12.200
work here, there's like home sales or whatever. It's


2074
01:44:12.200 --> 01:44:15.700
like telemarketing actually this type of energy, but there is


2075
01:44:15.700 --> 01:44:18.900
this energy here. It's like also it


2076
01:44:18.900 --> 01:44:21.300
you know works this way. So it works


2077
01:44:21.300 --> 01:44:24.300
through the rulership and then backwards because again, it works in


2078
01:44:24.300 --> 01:44:27.300
order, right? So Mars comes before the Sun not


2079
01:44:27.300 --> 01:44:30.900
the Sun to Mars even though it's the rulership. So


2080
01:44:30.900 --> 01:44:33.400
when you're talking about this, it's like the way that they push


2081
01:44:33.400 --> 01:44:34.400
forward to make money.


2082
01:44:35.500 --> 01:44:38.300
or sell something especially if it's something they don't believe in


2083
01:44:38.300 --> 01:44:40.300
can actually


2084
01:44:41.400 --> 01:44:44.500
like kill their sale they have to be very cautious


2085
01:44:44.500 --> 01:44:45.400
how they


2086
01:44:46.200 --> 01:44:50.000
Interact with money or they can have issues here Bank issues


2087
01:44:49.200 --> 01:44:52.500
too because the second house here is money


2088
01:44:52.500 --> 01:44:54.600
and you don't want to have issues with the bank.


2089
01:44:57.600 --> 01:45:00.100
How do you know they like spicy food but can't have it.


2090
01:45:00.100 --> 01:45:03.300
Yeah, it's in the aspects which this class isn't about


2091
01:45:03.300 --> 01:45:06.600
but Chiron it's so this is spicy areas of


2092
01:45:06.600 --> 01:45:11.100
spicy. Chiron is here meaning they


2093
01:45:10.100 --> 01:45:14.000
can't have it or there's something you know about


2094
01:45:13.200 --> 01:45:16.100
it that's not going to work and it could just be that


2095
01:45:16.100 --> 01:45:19.300
they can't have too much of it but cultural food right here this


2096
01:45:19.300 --> 01:45:23.200
like I said 30 degree angles are agitations.


2097
01:45:24.100 --> 01:45:26.200
so these two angles here are saying that


2098
01:45:27.300 --> 01:45:30.200
there's something about it that they can't have or they can't have too much of it.


2099
01:45:31.500 --> 01:45:34.200
Because Jupiter's expansive getting fat off


2100
01:45:34.200 --> 01:45:34.500
Jupiter.


2101
01:45:35.400 --> 01:45:37.000
By the T-shirt soon.


2102
01:45:39.800 --> 01:45:42.200
Angie I have to go back and write down all


2103
01:45:42.200 --> 01:45:46.000
the house meanings and then all the planet features lost


2104
01:45:45.400 --> 01:45:48.900
in the sauce without being able to look at the house or


2105
01:45:48.900 --> 01:45:51.500
plants and know the things about it understand ruler methods


2106
01:45:51.500 --> 01:45:54.600
though. Yeah. This is about understanding the methods and


2107
01:45:54.600 --> 01:45:57.300
how to do it. You know, nobody's going to be able to take these


2108
01:45:57.300 --> 01:46:00.800
five classes back to back and just recharge immediately. I'm


2109
01:46:00.800 --> 01:46:03.000
teaching you guys seven years, roughly.


2110
01:46:04.200 --> 01:46:07.700
The basics of it but the basics of seven years of me going


2111
01:46:07.700 --> 01:46:10.500
through so much trial and error to read charts


2112
01:46:10.500 --> 01:46:13.500
and you have to realize that remember I'm reading five to


2113
01:46:13.500 --> 01:46:14.900
six hundred charts a month.


2114
01:46:16.400 --> 01:46:17.000
on the low end


2115
01:46:18.100 --> 01:46:21.400
so I'm doing this day in and day out and until you guys are reading


2116
01:46:21.400 --> 01:46:23.900
charts constantly, you know, it's not going to


2117
01:46:25.400 --> 01:46:28.100
It it's like anything it takes time. But once you get


2118
01:46:28.100 --> 01:46:31.500
it, I know that you'll be able to you'll be able to do this. Otherwise, it


2119
01:46:31.500 --> 01:46:34.400
wouldn't be teaching it. I'm teaching it because I genuinely want


2120
01:46:34.400 --> 01:46:37.900
this method out there because I know this method works so, you


2121
01:46:37.900 --> 01:46:40.300
know, don't get hung up on.


2122
01:46:41.300 --> 01:46:45.100
The fact that it was one class than the next class understanding everything


2123
01:46:44.100 --> 01:46:47.400
that the seventh house can mean or Libra


2124
01:46:47.400 --> 01:46:50.100
or everything and it's more than I even listed. It's just too much


2125
01:46:50.100 --> 01:46:52.300
to list and I'll have to


2126
01:46:53.300 --> 01:46:56.200
maybe when I do my Wiki on on our platform when we launch


2127
01:46:56.200 --> 01:46:58.700
it, I'll include more about what each one means.


2128
01:46:59.700 --> 01:47:02.200
When you do your own research just be sure that you're


2129
01:47:02.200 --> 01:47:05.300
not looking at Vedic meanings because Vedic Leo is


2130
01:47:05.300 --> 01:47:08.200
different than Western tropical Leo. So if you're looking what


2131
01:47:08.200 --> 01:47:11.500
Leo means and your own eventic website, you're gonna confuse yourself


2132
01:47:11.500 --> 01:47:14.200
same thing with the houses same thing with the planets.


2133
01:47:18.300 --> 01:47:21.200
Angela this has been


2134
01:47:21.200 --> 01:47:24.600
a phenomenal class Blown Away. Honestly best I've taken I'll watch


2135
01:47:24.600 --> 01:47:27.500
this one again again. Thank you. I wasn't sure


2136
01:47:27.500 --> 01:47:30.200
because this is a tough one. There's all this


2137
01:47:30.200 --> 01:47:31.700
is a lot of the intricate stuff but


2138
01:47:32.700 --> 01:47:35.400
I just felt that there's not there's not a


2139
01:47:35.400 --> 01:47:38.000
lot on this stuff. And when you


2140
01:47:38.200 --> 01:47:41.400
do find it, it's like either very sparse or


2141
01:47:41.400 --> 01:47:44.100
contradicts the next site. So, you know,


2142
01:47:44.100 --> 01:47:46.400
I've like I said a lot of these I've


2143
01:47:47.600 --> 01:47:49.200
I've used them I use them all the time.


2144
01:47:51.100 --> 01:47:54.400
Some things that are on this because I just didn't remove them


2145
01:47:54.400 --> 01:47:57.200
like the part of Fortune Juno. They're so important


2146
01:47:57.200 --> 01:48:00.300
and you know the astrologists don't


2147
01:48:00.300 --> 01:48:03.900
use them. You guys are gonna be so ahead when you get this down and you


2148
01:48:03.900 --> 01:48:07.000
start understanding you start reading charts. You guys are going to be blowing people's


2149
01:48:06.600 --> 01:48:09.400
minds when you do these readings and


2150
01:48:09.400 --> 01:48:13.100
you get good at it because people and be how are you so accurate? It's


2151
01:48:12.100 --> 01:48:15.300
because of the system that you're using and your


2152
01:48:15.300 --> 01:48:18.600
trial and erroring everything and you're not using


2153
01:48:18.600 --> 01:48:21.300
the stuff that doesn't work. So you're not doing the hit or


2154
01:48:21.300 --> 01:48:22.100
miss strategy.


2155
01:48:23.300 --> 01:48:24.800
But I appreciate that I really do.


2156
01:48:25.700 --> 01:48:27.400
Kathy Logan, I just called in.


2157
01:48:29.400 --> 01:48:32.100
The hospital good class though. Oh, you just


2158
01:48:32.100 --> 01:48:35.400
got called into the hospital Kathy. Thank you so much for being here.


2159
01:48:35.400 --> 01:48:37.100
I appreciate you.


2160
01:48:39.100 --> 01:48:42.300
Taylor during the times where you lost


2161
01:48:42.300 --> 01:48:45.300
me, I think it had to do with aspects because I don't under aspect. Yeah,


2162
01:48:45.300 --> 01:48:48.600
it's tough because I have to teach this before aspects, but


2163
01:48:48.600 --> 01:48:51.300
when we're interpreting something I have to use aspects so


2164
01:48:51.300 --> 01:48:51.700
I tried.


2165
01:48:52.600 --> 01:48:55.600
To I shouldn't have given you the spicy thing


2166
01:48:55.600 --> 01:48:59.300
because I used aspects to tell you that but everything


2167
01:48:59.300 --> 01:49:02.300
else is like pulling it. All together aspects are the glue


2168
01:49:02.300 --> 01:49:05.600
so it does make it difficult to read without knowing aspects.


2169
01:49:06.700 --> 01:49:09.300
But I got to do one at a time it'll all


2170
01:49:09.300 --> 01:49:12.500
start pulling together and then we'll I'll end up doing classes where


2171
01:49:12.500 --> 01:49:15.200
we're like, I offer one-on-one too.


2172
01:49:15.200 --> 01:49:18.800
So I'll be doing a lot of one-on-one coaching to really like make


2173
01:49:18.800 --> 01:49:22.400
sure that you are reading things by understanding


2174
01:49:21.400 --> 01:49:24.300
the energies because that's what it comes down to is.


2175
01:49:25.100 --> 01:49:28.400
It's what are the energies that we're working with? And then


2176
01:49:28.400 --> 01:49:31.200
how does that rationally play out? Like I said earlier


2177
01:49:31.200 --> 01:49:32.500
we have a


2178
01:49:33.600 --> 01:49:37.400
A real, you know, this can mean religion Sagittarius. It


2179
01:49:36.400 --> 01:49:39.400
can mean the 11th house can mean


2180
01:49:39.400 --> 01:49:42.600
an organization and then we have the the planet


2181
01:49:42.600 --> 01:49:46.000
of spirituality in there. The second house is action. They


2182
01:49:45.500 --> 01:49:49.600
physically do something which is based off of communication and


2183
01:49:49.600 --> 01:49:52.600
then, you know Pisces energy spiritual as well. They could


2184
01:49:52.600 --> 01:49:55.300
make money being a sermon being a sermon


2185
01:49:55.300 --> 01:49:55.600
being a


2186
01:49:59.600 --> 01:50:02.000
preacher a minister something like that.


2187
01:50:03.600 --> 01:50:04.500
but I


2188
01:50:05.700 --> 01:50:08.200
You know you'd have to dive deeper. But that's what


2189
01:50:08.200 --> 01:50:11.600
I'm talking about. Just interpreting the energies. How could these play out? And


2190
01:50:11.600 --> 01:50:14.500
then you basically either write it down or get a list some


2191
01:50:14.500 --> 01:50:17.400
I look if I couldn't remember everything my mind


2192
01:50:17.400 --> 01:50:20.300
works like like this if you couldn't tell but some people


2193
01:50:20.300 --> 01:50:23.400
don't so if you need a pad a notepad


2194
01:50:23.400 --> 01:50:26.400
next to you and you just write down, you know third house


2195
01:50:26.400 --> 01:50:29.500
to in a little arrow to two house. So, you


2196
01:50:29.500 --> 01:50:32.600
know where the ruler is and then you just say your ideas. Well,


2197
01:50:32.600 --> 01:50:35.600
it could be this could be this could be this and then you just cross it


2198
01:50:35.600 --> 01:50:38.100
off as you get more information you're going to do the same thing. I


2199
01:50:38.100 --> 01:50:41.400
do in my head. You're just doing it on paper. You're narrowing it down.


2200
01:50:41.400 --> 01:50:44.300
And that's the whole thing is you could do this this and


2201
01:50:44.300 --> 01:50:47.400
this which is also why when we talk about life purpose with


2202
01:50:47.400 --> 01:50:48.200
the mid heaven,


2203
01:50:49.200 --> 01:50:52.300
And your outward expression that it's not just one thing a


2204
01:50:52.300 --> 01:50:55.300
lot of people think that the life that your life purpose at. Your


2205
01:50:55.300 --> 01:50:58.400
midheaven is only one thing and that's extremely limiting because


2206
01:50:58.400 --> 01:51:02.000
it can play out as long as you're within the energy it can


2207
01:51:01.200 --> 01:51:04.100
play out anyway, and then you look at progressions of


2208
01:51:04.100 --> 01:51:07.200
whatnot again another class to see what stage of life you're


2209
01:51:07.200 --> 01:51:07.300
in.


2210
01:51:09.400 --> 01:51:12.600
Do you feel like I have ruler ships down pretty well, as long


2211
01:51:12.600 --> 01:51:15.800
as you're doing reverse and standard ruler


2212
01:51:15.800 --> 01:51:18.200
ships. So I'm looking at the second house. It's ruler is


2213
01:51:18.200 --> 01:51:18.900
Neptune.


2214
01:51:19.500 --> 01:51:23.200
Neptune is the ruler of Pisces cool.


2215
01:51:22.200 --> 01:51:25.600
I already knew that because that's how I got there. But


2216
01:51:25.600 --> 01:51:27.900
in this house Mars is sitting there.


2217
01:51:28.800 --> 01:51:31.200
So Mars is the ruler of what Ares so


2218
01:51:31.200 --> 01:51:34.200
I pull in Aries. Everything is happening right here gets pulled into


2219
01:51:34.200 --> 01:51:37.500
my my second house of money value


2220
01:51:37.500 --> 01:51:39.000
self-worth possessions.


2221
01:51:41.100 --> 01:51:41.300
food


2222
01:51:43.500 --> 01:51:46.600
how far can your interpretation go no, only


2223
01:51:46.600 --> 01:51:48.700
knowing ruler ships and aspects you can't.


2224
01:51:50.300 --> 01:51:53.300
You couldn't stop here. Like if you really want to read a


2225
01:51:53.300 --> 01:51:55.500
chart aspects or like I said aspects are the glue.


2226
01:51:56.100 --> 01:51:59.800
So when I'm looking here understanding there's a semi sextile here. There's


2227
01:51:59.800 --> 01:52:02.200
a semi-sex tile here and you get


2228
01:52:02.200 --> 01:52:05.100
good at looking at them, but you can always use this chart down here.


2229
01:52:05.100 --> 01:52:06.100
These are all the aspects.


2230
01:52:07.600 --> 01:52:10.200
But when I'm looking at here understanding the


2231
01:52:10.200 --> 01:52:13.900
part of Fortune the ascendant are forming another semi-sexile which


2232
01:52:13.900 --> 01:52:16.300
is why they're so important Vesta and


2233
01:52:16.300 --> 01:52:18.300
Saturn are forming a semi-sex tile here.


2234
01:52:19.100 --> 01:52:23.600
Pluto is forming a a sex tautipolis


2235
01:52:22.600 --> 01:52:25.800
and to Saturn this all


2236
01:52:25.800 --> 01:52:28.500
has meaning which means this house and this house are connected


2237
01:52:28.500 --> 01:52:28.800
as well.


2238
01:52:30.400 --> 01:52:33.400
And then understanding that Pluto is connected to these two,


2239
01:52:33.400 --> 01:52:36.700
but the North Node sits separate. So the North Node


2240
01:52:36.700 --> 01:52:39.800
is only connected to this through Pluto.


2241
01:52:42.600 --> 01:52:46.000
I hope I didn't lose you on that. So this aspect and


2242
01:52:45.400 --> 01:52:48.600
this other aspect here these have meaning but they


2243
01:52:48.600 --> 01:52:51.500
are not aspecting the North Node. So the North Node and Saturn


2244
01:52:51.500 --> 01:52:52.200
don't have a relationship.


2245
01:52:55.100 --> 01:52:56.500
The layers make so much sense.


2246
01:52:57.300 --> 01:53:00.300
I'm glad it does I was worried that I would lose you guys


2247
01:53:00.300 --> 01:53:03.200
on that but layers are so important because you know,


2248
01:53:03.200 --> 01:53:04.800
it's it's one thing to know.


2249
01:53:05.800 --> 01:53:08.100
What's another one to look at? What's something we didn't look


2250
01:53:08.100 --> 01:53:11.400
at? All right. Let's do this one here to know that.


2251
01:53:12.700 --> 01:53:15.200
You're set this person's if we're looking


2252
01:53:15.200 --> 01:53:18.900
at the lens of marriage. This person wants a long-term marriage.


2253
01:53:18.900 --> 01:53:21.200
It's at 10. So it's in Sagittarius. So this is more of


2254
01:53:21.200 --> 01:53:24.400
a religious marriage one based on philosophy with their partner


2255
01:53:24.400 --> 01:53:28.100
and it is the ruler of Capricorn which


2256
01:53:27.100 --> 01:53:30.500
is in the 12th house. So there has to be a spiritualism


2257
01:53:30.500 --> 01:53:33.000
and the person the right person will be


2258
01:53:33.500 --> 01:53:36.400
their lucky charm here and there's good luck in relationships that


2259
01:53:36.400 --> 01:53:39.200
they have which is great, but it can sit behind the scenes.


2260
01:53:40.300 --> 01:53:43.300
And I don't have another one to layer. So I would have to use


2261
01:53:43.300 --> 01:53:46.400
the aspects to Saturn again 10 to


2262
01:53:46.400 --> 01:53:50.000
13. That's actually really good. But I have Saturn 10


2263
01:53:49.200 --> 01:53:51.700
to 11. This is a square.


2264
01:53:52.500 --> 01:53:55.400
Right again, we'll talk about squares later squares are


2265
01:53:55.400 --> 01:53:58.200
not always bad squares can be very good, but they will


2266
01:53:58.200 --> 01:54:00.300
initially come off as conflict.


2267
01:54:01.100 --> 01:54:04.300
So this part the public image of this person's friends or


2268
01:54:04.300 --> 01:54:08.100
their Partners friends because it's Scorpios energy versus the


2269
01:54:07.100 --> 01:54:09.700
relationship. They have to be careful.


2270
01:54:10.600 --> 01:54:13.300
That their partner's friends are not talking


2271
01:54:13.300 --> 01:54:14.100
crap about them.


2272
01:54:14.900 --> 01:54:15.600
especially online


2273
01:54:17.900 --> 01:54:20.900
and then Juno is in that house too which spills into


2274
01:54:20.900 --> 01:54:23.300
the mid having spills into the 11th house or spills


2275
01:54:23.300 --> 01:54:25.500
into the fourth house so layers you keep going.


2276
01:54:26.400 --> 01:54:30.100
And that's why the readings can get very very deep.


2277
01:54:31.100 --> 01:54:34.300
Random question. Do you ever take into consideration numerology or


2278
01:54:34.300 --> 01:54:37.300
human design whenever you do readings or do you find those to be scams? I


2279
01:54:37.300 --> 01:54:40.600
trust you. So I'd like to know I'm interested in human


2280
01:54:40.600 --> 01:54:41.000
design.


2281
01:54:42.100 --> 01:54:45.800
I just haven't had a minute to look at it. So I don't have an actual


2282
01:54:45.800 --> 01:54:47.200
opinion. I have informed one yet.


2283
01:54:48.300 --> 01:54:51.500
But I really want to get into it just


2284
01:54:51.500 --> 01:54:54.500
to either prove it or disprove it in my own mind. Obviously. It's


2285
01:54:54.500 --> 01:54:56.000
a completely different system and it's


2286
01:54:57.600 --> 01:55:00.200
I don't know how I would marry them. But that's because


2287
01:55:00.200 --> 01:55:03.100
I don't really know that system yet. I've dabbled in


2288
01:55:03.100 --> 01:55:07.000
it into the different types and but not


2289
01:55:06.300 --> 01:55:07.900
enough to make any.


2290
01:55:09.700 --> 01:55:11.200
Any awareness or anything?


2291
01:55:12.200 --> 01:55:13.200
and numerology


2292
01:55:14.700 --> 01:55:18.500
numerology have to be careful with because numerology


2293
01:55:17.500 --> 01:55:19.000
can really


2294
01:55:22.300 --> 01:55:25.300
I believe in numerology I use numerology but I don't use


2295
01:55:25.300 --> 01:55:26.800
it as deep as some people because


2296
01:55:28.100 --> 01:55:31.200
While numbers have resonating frequencies, they're too easy


2297
01:55:31.200 --> 01:55:34.100
to manipulate. I can't manipulate a planet. I can


2298
01:55:34.100 --> 01:55:37.400
manipulate numbers. I can do it on a spreadsheet. I can


2299
01:55:37.400 --> 01:55:40.700
see my bank account and transfer a dollar. You have


2300
01:55:40.700 --> 01:55:42.100
to be very careful with


2301
01:55:43.100 --> 01:55:45.600
how numerology they and


2302
01:55:46.900 --> 01:55:49.700
so I changed my name changed my


2303
01:55:49.700 --> 01:55:52.400
name a couple times in my life, but I changed my name in my


2304
01:55:52.400 --> 01:55:52.800
Saturn return.


2305
01:55:53.900 --> 01:55:53.900
and


2306
01:55:56.600 --> 01:55:59.500
I remember reading up numerology while I was doing it. One


2307
01:55:59.500 --> 01:56:02.300
of the biggest things that said is do not choose a name based on


2308
01:56:02.300 --> 01:56:05.200
numerology because it won't it won't resonate that way


2309
01:56:05.200 --> 01:56:08.800
it'll resonate as as intentional as


2310
01:56:08.800 --> 01:56:11.700
opposed to organic. So you


2311
01:56:11.700 --> 01:56:15.000
do have to be very careful with numerology. I


2312
01:56:14.300 --> 01:56:17.300
watch things as they play out. I watched the


2313
01:56:17.300 --> 01:56:20.800
years. I know that 2023 for instance is a seven seven is


2314
01:56:20.800 --> 01:56:22.700
very spiritual year, but at the same time


2315
01:56:23.800 --> 01:56:26.300
Saturn's moving into Pisces. So of course, it's going


2316
01:56:26.300 --> 01:56:29.700
to be the next two years you're gonna be spiritual so I don't put as


2317
01:56:29.700 --> 01:56:32.500
much stock into those things. I would


2318
01:56:32.500 --> 01:56:33.500
imagine that if you're doing


2319
01:56:34.800 --> 01:56:37.400
use the word stock but if you're doing stocks and


2320
01:56:37.400 --> 01:56:40.300
you're doing things like that the numerology would matter a bit more when


2321
01:56:40.300 --> 01:56:43.400
you're dealing with money and dealing with numbers as opposed to everyday life,


2322
01:56:43.400 --> 01:56:44.100
but I do look at like


2323
01:56:45.200 --> 01:56:50.000
Like won't last time we went to Vegas. We stayed in room 17117 and


2324
01:56:49.100 --> 01:56:52.300
it was a lucky it was a good trip. We did get


2325
01:56:52.300 --> 01:56:55.300
sick. So I don't know how lucky but we also you know,


2326
01:56:55.300 --> 01:56:58.500
my wife is a holistic practitioner. She's an


2327
01:56:58.500 --> 01:57:01.500
herbalist and she took care of I got strep throat. Actually. She took


2328
01:57:01.500 --> 01:57:05.300
care of strep throat in like two hours four hours.


2329
01:57:05.300 --> 01:57:07.900
It was completely gone in 20 minutes little white dots were gone.


2330
01:57:08.900 --> 01:57:11.400
She's just freaking amazing, which is why you know,


2331
01:57:11.400 --> 01:57:14.600
this is what we're doing. And while we have other businesses we've


2332
01:57:14.600 --> 01:57:17.300
decided that this is our focus and this is we need


2333
01:57:17.300 --> 01:57:20.300
to get this out. We need more people to live good lives


2334
01:57:20.300 --> 01:57:23.900
and there's so many good people out there including most of you. I'm sure that


2335
01:57:23.900 --> 01:57:24.200
just


2336
01:57:25.400 --> 01:57:28.400
You just need to understand the energies because then you can do anything


2337
01:57:28.400 --> 01:57:32.400
you want with them. But I like numerology


2338
01:57:31.400 --> 01:57:34.100
I use numerology. I don't


2339
01:57:34.100 --> 01:57:38.000
use as much as I use tarot and in astrology


2340
01:57:37.200 --> 01:57:40.400
I use astrology in Tarot constantly. I'm


2341
01:57:40.400 --> 01:57:44.200
surprised. Oh, that's right. I moved it because of this I


2342
01:57:43.200 --> 01:57:47.200
have my oh it's in here. So, you


2343
01:57:46.200 --> 01:57:49.400
know I have my Terror decks are always Within Reach


2344
01:57:50.600 --> 01:57:54.400
Here's another one sitting right here. And that's


2345
01:57:54.400 --> 01:57:55.800
that's kind of our thing, but


2346
01:57:57.500 --> 01:57:59.300
That's what I have for that Linnea.


2347
01:57:59.900 --> 01:58:03.100
What about for example? I've 18 degrees ascendant.


2348
01:58:02.100 --> 01:58:05.400
Okay, so your second second deck in


2349
01:58:05.400 --> 01:58:10.000
ascendant in cancer. So it is cancer scorpio


2350
01:58:08.300 --> 01:58:11.200
rather with a


2351
01:58:11.200 --> 01:58:14.700
12 degree Mars. What does the degree of the ascendant and


2352
01:58:14.700 --> 01:58:17.200
descendant or I see have to do with the planet.


2353
01:58:17.200 --> 01:58:17.600
It's nothing.


2354
01:58:18.400 --> 01:58:19.900
because the the


2355
01:58:21.800 --> 01:58:24.400
Um, the ascendant The Descent and midheaven and


2356
01:58:24.400 --> 01:58:28.900
IC are points their mathematical points. I mean,


2357
01:58:28.900 --> 01:58:31.300
they're derived the ascendant descent and it derived


2358
01:58:31.300 --> 01:58:33.900
off of the ascendant the constellation at the horizon.


2359
01:58:34.900 --> 01:58:37.600
But they are specific to


2360
01:58:37.600 --> 01:58:40.400
the themes that they represent. So the ascendant


2361
01:58:40.400 --> 01:58:43.700
has to do with you how you react to the world your physical body descendant how


2362
01:58:43.700 --> 01:58:46.700
you work with others? What type of Partners you attract made


2363
01:58:46.700 --> 01:58:49.200
Heaven is your outward expression. I see is your inner


2364
01:58:49.200 --> 01:58:52.600
expression and childhood midheaven also career and life purpose


2365
01:58:52.600 --> 01:58:55.400
because that's what you the opposite of your childhood.


2366
01:58:55.400 --> 01:58:57.200
It's what you kind of balance yourself out with.


2367
01:58:58.600 --> 01:59:02.000
Um with Mars at 12 degrees and


2368
01:59:01.400 --> 01:59:04.300
it and an ascendant at 18 degrees


2369
01:59:04.300 --> 01:59:07.700
remember that Mars were to go here.


2370
01:59:07.700 --> 01:59:10.300
It is Mars is only a three


2371
01:59:10.300 --> 01:59:13.400
to four degree orb of influence. So if we take a 12 degree


2372
01:59:13.400 --> 01:59:16.900
Mars, and we add 4 degrees at 16 you


2373
01:59:16.900 --> 01:59:19.400
have an ascendant at 18. So there


2374
01:59:19.400 --> 01:59:22.300
is no correlation between the two they don't impact each other.


2375
01:59:22.300 --> 01:59:25.300
You would just have Mars in the first house which has


2376
01:59:25.300 --> 01:59:29.200
a definition but it's not completely attached


2377
01:59:28.200 --> 01:59:31.200
to your ascendant.


2378
01:59:34.500 --> 01:59:38.200
And I didn't mention this before but the points don't


2379
01:59:37.200 --> 01:59:40.700
have an orb of influence. They have


2380
01:59:40.700 --> 01:59:41.400
to be exact.


2381
01:59:43.300 --> 01:59:45.800
So it just it is what it is. So for you.


2382
01:59:48.700 --> 01:59:51.200
Your sentence at 18 degrees in cancer. It's actually pretty


2383
01:59:51.200 --> 01:59:54.400
much this is sitting right here. There is no orb of


2384
01:59:54.400 --> 01:59:57.200
influence. It's just 18 degrees. That's it. It was a line.


2385
01:59:57.200 --> 01:59:57.700
It was a point.


2386
01:59:58.600 --> 02:00:01.700
It's not a planet or anything. So there is no energy that


2387
02:00:01.700 --> 02:00:04.800
goes outward and it doesn't emit any energy. That's


2388
02:00:04.800 --> 02:00:07.400
the other thing to realize that there's no energy that's


2389
02:00:07.400 --> 02:00:10.400
emitted. It is a definition is a defined


2390
02:00:10.400 --> 02:00:13.300
point. It just gives you information now if


2391
02:00:13.300 --> 02:00:16.800
Mars were closer and we're on the ascendant then


2392
02:00:17.700 --> 02:00:20.400
The energy of Mars would be embedded in


2393
02:00:20.400 --> 02:00:24.000
baked into your physical body. Now you may have Mars


2394
02:00:23.300 --> 02:00:26.800
traits, but you would be extremely Martian


2395
02:00:26.800 --> 02:00:29.200
if you had it right on


2396
02:00:29.200 --> 02:00:32.500
your send it so you would be extremely athletic like that


2397
02:00:32.500 --> 02:00:35.100
would be your purpose moving forward. Everything would be


2398
02:00:35.100 --> 02:00:35.800
all about Fitness.


2399
02:00:37.200 --> 02:00:38.300
versus Fitness


2400
02:00:39.300 --> 02:00:40.700
And wherever Mars sits.


2401
02:00:41.600 --> 02:00:44.400
Action being a part of


2402
02:00:44.400 --> 02:00:48.400
who you are part of your your house of self, but


2403
02:00:47.400 --> 02:00:50.500
you read it more towards it's just a sign


2404
02:00:50.500 --> 02:00:53.500
in the first house in the sign of Cancer. So you


2405
02:00:53.500 --> 02:00:54.900
do things for family.


2406
02:00:57.500 --> 02:01:00.100
And then wherever Aries is which would be up


2407
02:01:00.100 --> 02:01:01.900
here. So your career.


2408
02:01:03.200 --> 02:01:05.400
You would have a career likely in.


2409
02:01:07.400 --> 02:01:10.100
in some sort of nurturing or real estate or


2410
02:01:13.300 --> 02:01:14.500
sometimes the housewife


2411
02:01:15.500 --> 02:01:18.500
You know tending to the kids is the mom being


2412
02:01:18.500 --> 02:01:19.700
a mom could be your job.


2413
02:01:22.200 --> 02:01:25.200
But it has to be something again because it's the ruler is in your


2414
02:01:25.200 --> 02:01:28.100
tenth house. It has to be something Aries. So it has


2415
02:01:28.100 --> 02:01:32.300
to Be Your Own Boss you do things your own way something physical


2416
02:01:31.300 --> 02:01:34.300
something and because it's in the first house and


2417
02:01:34.300 --> 02:01:37.400
it's Aries. It's something physical something you have to physically


2418
02:01:37.400 --> 02:01:40.300
wake up and do every day is your career and


2419
02:01:40.300 --> 02:01:42.700
then wherever your mid Heaven would add information.


2420
02:01:45.000 --> 02:01:45.300
cool


2421
02:01:48.100 --> 02:01:51.400
Angie you're so good. Oh, thank you and thank


2422
02:01:51.400 --> 02:01:54.500
you for everything always learn something new with every interaction


2423
02:01:54.500 --> 02:01:57.500
had me laughing at the printerest the deccans.


2424
02:01:57.500 --> 02:02:00.200
I don't know. I don't know in the front. The


2425
02:02:00.200 --> 02:02:03.300
reason why I even bring it up is because people are correcting me. They're like,


2426
02:02:03.300 --> 02:02:06.500
it's Deacon like it's not it's not it's


2427
02:02:06.500 --> 02:02:10.000
literally means 10 decathlon decagon


2428
02:02:09.000 --> 02:02:10.700
deca.


2429
02:02:11.200 --> 02:02:14.200
Deca Deccan, it's just


2430
02:02:15.100 --> 02:02:18.400
it used to bother me so much. Like why are you correcting me? You're saying


2431
02:02:18.400 --> 02:02:18.700
it wrong?


2432
02:02:19.500 --> 02:02:22.200
And some of the astrologers I really like they were saying it wrong


2433
02:02:22.200 --> 02:02:23.600
and I'm like, oh God, come on guys.


2434
02:02:24.300 --> 02:02:26.000
It you know, it's derived off of 10.


2435
02:02:26.900 --> 02:02:28.800
10 degrees Taylor


2436
02:02:29.700 --> 02:02:32.200
What I'm seeing is that the second house is connected to the


2437
02:02:32.200 --> 02:02:35.700
oh in this example. See second house


2438
02:02:35.700 --> 02:02:36.200
is connected.


2439
02:02:37.900 --> 02:02:40.300
To the 11th and the 11th pulls additional information


2440
02:02:40.300 --> 02:02:43.600
from the fourth house. Yes, because it's


2441
02:02:43.600 --> 02:02:46.500
ruler isn't home, right? The


2442
02:02:46.500 --> 02:02:49.600
second house ruler isn't in the second house. So money


2443
02:02:49.600 --> 02:02:52.300
is not focusing on money money is


2444
02:02:52.300 --> 02:02:55.100
focusing up here in teams in groups and


2445
02:02:55.100 --> 02:02:56.500
organization. Which means


2446
02:02:57.600 --> 02:03:00.500
Anything that has to do with money, you know go over here


2447
02:03:00.500 --> 02:03:03.400
go three houses up here and go talk to the ruler


2448
02:03:03.400 --> 02:03:06.100
over here because all the money stuff is over here.


2449
02:03:07.300 --> 02:03:07.900
So that's like


2450
02:03:08.800 --> 02:03:11.500
I think that's probably the easiest way right and then


2451
02:03:11.500 --> 02:03:14.100
you know, the ruler of the money house is over here


2452
02:03:14.100 --> 02:03:16.800
in this house, and it's rulers not home either.


2453
02:03:17.800 --> 02:03:20.500
So in order for the money ruler to


2454
02:03:20.500 --> 02:03:23.600
be able to do anything with teams, it has to go visit the


2455
02:03:23.600 --> 02:03:25.600
ruler sitting down here in the fourth house.


2456
02:03:28.100 --> 02:03:31.800
And you know in the second house of money the ruler's


2457
02:03:31.800 --> 02:03:34.000
gone. It's over here. But you know,


2458
02:03:34.200 --> 02:03:37.300
the ruler of the third house is now occupying here like trying to


2459
02:03:37.300 --> 02:03:38.400
get in on this money action.


2460
02:03:39.200 --> 02:03:42.200
So he's like where did they come from where they came from here? They came


2461
02:03:42.200 --> 02:03:45.700
from all of this energy here all of this energy impacts this


2462
02:03:45.700 --> 02:03:47.700
which is which is


2463
02:03:48.700 --> 02:03:51.400
derived over into here and then this


2464
02:03:51.400 --> 02:03:54.200
is over here. So this feeds this this feeds this


2465
02:03:54.200 --> 02:03:55.400
which is fed into this.


2466
02:03:56.300 --> 02:03:56.800
So yes.


2467
02:04:00.900 --> 02:04:03.500
So yes, you are on the right track for


2468
02:04:03.500 --> 02:04:03.600
that.


2469
02:04:05.600 --> 02:04:08.200
If we're looking at home life in the


2470
02:04:08.200 --> 02:04:12.000
fourth house, is it connected to the sixth house because of the


2471
02:04:11.200 --> 02:04:12.600
Moon? Yes.


2472
02:04:14.800 --> 02:04:17.800
And the 11th house because of Jupiter absolutely, right?


2473
02:04:17.800 --> 02:04:18.600
So you're using


2474
02:04:19.700 --> 02:04:22.600
your this what you're using is reverse.


2475
02:04:23.400 --> 02:04:24.300
rulership's


2476
02:04:24.900 --> 02:04:27.000
because the sixth house ruler is here.


2477
02:04:28.100 --> 02:04:31.900
You're using it reverse and the 11th house rulers here. So the 11th


2478
02:04:31.900 --> 02:04:34.800
house feeds in here. So the fourth house all feeds


2479
02:04:34.800 --> 02:04:37.700
into the eleven that feeds into the sixth.


2480
02:04:40.100 --> 02:04:43.300
Your brain is working properly, but then the forward.


2481
02:04:44.200 --> 02:04:47.000
Rulership is Venus and that's sitting here in the


2482
02:04:47.300 --> 02:04:47.600
third house.


2483
02:04:48.400 --> 02:04:52.300
So everything that has to do with home is baked


2484
02:04:51.300 --> 02:04:54.900
into identity communication siblings


2485
02:04:54.900 --> 02:04:57.400
whatnot. It means that every


2486
02:04:57.400 --> 02:05:00.400
Everything has to do with the mother has to do with communication everything that


2487
02:05:00.400 --> 02:05:03.300
has to do with family has to do with siblings or cousins.


2488
02:05:04.200 --> 02:05:08.100
Everything that this person literally identifies with


2489
02:05:07.100 --> 02:05:10.900
their home, which is attached to their friends


2490
02:05:10.900 --> 02:05:11.800
and their work.


2491
02:05:16.300 --> 02:05:19.300
And that's the other thing. I think it's really important. And I know this is at


2492
02:05:19.300 --> 02:05:22.300
the end in the Q&amp;A, but I think it's really important to understand that


2493
02:05:22.300 --> 02:05:25.300
you have that energy doesn't play out one


2494
02:05:25.300 --> 02:05:25.500
way.


2495
02:05:26.200 --> 02:05:29.600
Energy plays out lots of ways because there's not one


2496
02:05:29.600 --> 02:05:33.100
thing in your life. The sixth house for instance is Health.


2497
02:05:32.100 --> 02:05:35.300
It is your chores. It


2498
02:05:35.300 --> 02:05:39.200
is routine. It's day to day stuff. It is your service


2499
02:05:38.200 --> 02:05:41.600
to others. It's your sense


2500
02:05:41.600 --> 02:05:44.900
of Duty. It's pets small pets. Now sometimes


2501
02:05:44.900 --> 02:05:47.200
small pets end up in the fifth house because we treat them like


2502
02:05:47.200 --> 02:05:50.000
children, but for the most part it's in the sixth house.


2503
02:05:50.200 --> 02:05:53.900
So when I'm that's why lenses are so important when


2504
02:05:53.900 --> 02:05:56.900
I'm looking at that through the lens of work. All


2505
02:05:56.900 --> 02:05:59.400
right, six house work, right? It


2506
02:05:59.400 --> 02:06:02.100
also means health health and work pets at


2507
02:06:02.100 --> 02:06:06.000
work, right? We're always talking about work work, you know


2508
02:06:06.400 --> 02:06:07.800
second house fourth house is home.


2509
02:06:08.600 --> 02:06:09.400
But I'm talking about.


2510
02:06:10.400 --> 02:06:11.000
work


2511
02:06:11.800 --> 02:06:14.300
So if I work can I work from home? Yes


2512
02:06:14.300 --> 02:06:17.400
work from home is supported right here doing something


2513
02:06:17.400 --> 02:06:21.100
online with Groups International even spiritual


2514
02:06:20.100 --> 02:06:23.600
supported here from work, but that


2515
02:06:23.600 --> 02:06:26.700
work is either Financial it's value.


2516
02:06:26.700 --> 02:06:29.800
It's Mother Nature oriented like herbalism or


2517
02:06:29.800 --> 02:06:32.300
something like that because it pulls in the sixth house


2518
02:06:32.300 --> 02:06:35.600
energy, which is also health and it's food so


2519
02:06:35.600 --> 02:06:36.300
health food.


2520
02:06:37.800 --> 02:06:40.500
This is also culture cultural health food.


2521
02:06:41.600 --> 02:06:43.300
Right. We were kind of on that train earlier.


2522
02:06:44.600 --> 02:06:47.400
But that's you know, that's how it pulls and and then how does that


2523
02:06:47.400 --> 02:06:50.700
work? Well it has to do with identity it has to do with maybe I


2524
02:06:50.700 --> 02:06:53.400
do it because I'm Italian and that's in an I


2525
02:06:53.400 --> 02:06:56.200
sell it because of that or more importantly because my


2526
02:06:56.200 --> 02:06:57.500
partners I tell Italian.


2527
02:06:58.600 --> 02:06:59.900
And then I do the sales of it.


2528
02:07:02.600 --> 02:07:05.200
Literally selling food and that's how I make my


2529
02:07:05.200 --> 02:07:08.600
money and I do it overseas or I do it. You know Pisces could


2530
02:07:08.600 --> 02:07:11.200
be like I do the behind the scenes. I don't actually make the food


2531
02:07:11.200 --> 02:07:14.200
because my partner this seventh house ruler is


2532
02:07:14.200 --> 02:07:17.100
sitting here. Maybe my partner makes the food and I sell it.


2533
02:07:18.200 --> 02:07:21.000
Where she tells me what to do. We just could also be


2534
02:07:21.200 --> 02:07:21.500
this as well.


2535
02:07:23.100 --> 02:07:26.300
Chiron in retrograde isn't I will


2536
02:07:26.300 --> 02:07:29.600
be going over Chiron stuff in the asteroids and


2537
02:07:29.600 --> 02:07:32.000
part of Fort and Arabic Parts class.


2538
02:07:33.200 --> 02:07:36.400
I won't be going over that here. Chiron is a


2539
02:07:36.400 --> 02:07:39.300
lot of the retrogrades and whatnot are all are usually in Chiron because


2540
02:07:39.300 --> 02:07:40.600
they're extremely internalized.


2541
02:07:43.900 --> 02:07:46.100
It's interesting that this one's not but often it


2542
02:07:46.100 --> 02:07:46.300
is.


2543
02:07:47.100 --> 02:07:50.400
I want to see an example with an empty


2544
02:07:50.400 --> 02:07:50.900
second house.


2545
02:07:53.400 --> 02:07:55.900
Probably pretty easy. Just go back go.


2546
02:07:59.800 --> 02:08:01.000
Yeah, go back like two hours.


2547
02:08:05.500 --> 02:08:07.000
There you go. Empty second house.


2548
02:08:08.900 --> 02:08:11.200
So empty second house means I've got nothing to work


2549
02:08:11.200 --> 02:08:14.200
with here. It means that money is not a main focus of life. It's


2550
02:08:14.200 --> 02:08:17.400
a query and energy. So this person makes money through networking through


2551
02:08:17.400 --> 02:08:22.600
friends through online tech and humanitarian


2552
02:08:20.600 --> 02:08:23.700
efforts. It's


2553
02:08:23.700 --> 02:08:26.200
ruler is Uranus, which is again in the


2554
02:08:26.200 --> 02:08:29.200
same place mid Heaven is there junos there.


2555
02:08:29.200 --> 02:08:33.100
So they work with a partner. We didn't go over June that's a different class and Scorpio.


2556
02:08:32.100 --> 02:08:35.500
So Scorpio is either psychology or


2557
02:08:35.500 --> 02:08:38.300
you know, this could be group therapy that this person


2558
02:08:38.300 --> 02:08:41.100
works like online group therapy. It could be that


2559
02:08:41.100 --> 02:08:44.500
they work with other people's assets online. So they maybe they


2560
02:08:44.500 --> 02:08:47.300
take Tech because that ruler is


2561
02:08:47.300 --> 02:08:50.200
sitting here. Maybe they take Tech and they


2562
02:08:50.200 --> 02:08:53.100
repurpose it for something that they want to


2563
02:08:53.100 --> 02:08:56.100
do and then if you dive deeper, it's like where's Pluto Pluto's up here?


2564
02:08:56.100 --> 02:08:59.600
Okay, so they make money through doing this for their career


2565
02:08:59.600 --> 02:09:02.300
and that career has to do with Libra.


2566
02:09:02.300 --> 02:09:04.400
So maybe it's online tech. Excuse me.


2567
02:09:05.400 --> 02:09:08.800
For a corporation remember tenth houses corporations and government


2568
02:09:08.800 --> 02:09:11.300
whatnot could be government but it's


2569
02:09:11.300 --> 02:09:14.300
public facing or it is Art. It could


2570
02:09:14.300 --> 02:09:16.500
be like something art related or design.


2571
02:09:18.700 --> 02:09:21.400
And then you could take this again you could go deeper and it


2572
02:09:21.400 --> 02:09:24.600
goes to the fourth house in Aries, and this could be never ending but


2573
02:09:24.600 --> 02:09:27.000
you can really get into all the details but this is


2574
02:09:27.500 --> 02:09:30.100
an empty second house. I don't have any other information to go


2575
02:09:30.100 --> 02:09:33.300
off of so, I know that it's not a huge emphasis on


2576
02:09:33.300 --> 02:09:36.300
their life, but also remember that because we're


2577
02:09:36.300 --> 02:09:39.100
talking about the second house of money that we also have


2578
02:09:39.100 --> 02:09:42.400
to talk about the natural ruler, which is Venus. We also


2579
02:09:42.400 --> 02:09:44.900
have to talk about the natural ruler of Taurus.


2580
02:09:45.600 --> 02:09:48.100
And Taurus over here is money can come through


2581
02:09:48.100 --> 02:09:51.700
children money can come through Recreation and then Venus is


2582
02:09:51.700 --> 02:09:54.100
sitting here and it is with the South node. So


2583
02:09:54.100 --> 02:09:57.700
inherent talents and then it makes aspects


2584
02:09:57.700 --> 02:10:00.400
which we are going to get into but not today and


2585
02:10:00.400 --> 02:10:03.100
actually this person Venus is an aspecting


2586
02:10:03.100 --> 02:10:03.400
anything.


2587
02:10:04.300 --> 02:10:05.400
aside from this conjunction


2588
02:10:09.100 --> 02:10:11.300
So then we would look at all the other energy and then Mars.


2589
02:10:12.100 --> 02:10:14.300
Which is in the third house in Pisces?


2590
02:10:15.100 --> 02:10:18.300
So it keeps going and then that's how you narrow it down. And


2591
02:10:18.300 --> 02:10:21.500
that's just with a natal chart that doesn't include progressions or relocations


2592
02:10:21.500 --> 02:10:24.800
or anything like that and I'm not trying to overwhelm anybody. I just


2593
02:10:24.800 --> 02:10:27.400
want you to know that the basics are going to get you so far which


2594
02:10:27.400 --> 02:10:30.500
is you're gonna get a lot further than most people but then


2595
02:10:30.500 --> 02:10:33.300
as you keep studying Diamond deeper, you're going to learn the things


2596
02:10:33.300 --> 02:10:36.000
that are important and there's so much to astrology and I


2597
02:10:36.300 --> 02:10:39.200
do the things that I think are most important there are branches.


2598
02:10:40.200 --> 02:10:43.100
That I haven't gotten into like medical astrology because there's so much


2599
02:10:43.100 --> 02:10:44.800
conflicting information. I just haven't


2600
02:10:45.700 --> 02:10:48.100
really just haven't had the patience to get into it.


2601
02:10:50.800 --> 02:10:54.000
Taylor having to do with identity is


2602
02:10:53.600 --> 02:10:56.300
three three third house is


2603
02:10:56.300 --> 02:10:58.300
from forward rulership. Yes.


2604
02:10:59.900 --> 02:11:02.400
From that last chart not this one. Yep.


2605
02:11:04.200 --> 02:11:04.800
identity


2606
02:11:05.800 --> 02:11:07.500
third house is your identity.


2607
02:11:09.500 --> 02:11:12.400
Which I which I think is interesting because it is never listed.


2608
02:11:13.300 --> 02:11:13.900
anywhere


2609
02:11:17.600 --> 02:11:20.500
never listed anywhere as identity. It's always just communication.


2610
02:11:22.900 --> 02:11:23.900
Yuna


2611
02:11:24.700 --> 02:11:27.000
Thank you so much for teaching. It's amazing system. I'm so excited.


2612
02:11:28.600 --> 02:11:31.300
To learn more. Aw. Thank you. I'm excited to teach


2613
02:11:31.300 --> 02:11:34.600
more. I mean, I'm genuinely excited for people to


2614
02:11:34.600 --> 02:11:37.500
be able to read accurately and


2615
02:11:37.500 --> 02:11:40.400
really use things and when we get into transits,


2616
02:11:43.100 --> 02:11:46.400
We get into transits these little green glyphs going around being able


2617
02:11:46.400 --> 02:11:49.400
to understand that this is impacting this and that


2618
02:11:49.400 --> 02:11:52.800
this is impacting this and when you put it all together, and


2619
02:11:52.800 --> 02:11:54.600
like I said at the beginning you'll have to slow down.


2620
02:11:55.500 --> 02:11:58.300
Maybe your brain doesn't work as Haywire as mine


2621
02:11:58.300 --> 02:12:01.200
does but that's okay. Don't worry about it. As long


2622
02:12:01.200 --> 02:12:04.800
as you have the information you find your own way to make it work. It's all


2623
02:12:04.800 --> 02:12:05.900
all it's all about.


2624
02:12:08.700 --> 02:12:11.500
The last thing I'm confused about the information you get from doing forward versus


2625
02:12:11.500 --> 02:12:14.300
reverse. That's a good question. So when you're when you're doing


2626
02:12:14.300 --> 02:12:17.100
forward relationship, I kind of


2627
02:12:17.100 --> 02:12:20.700
explained it in the theory before it's this house here is not


2628
02:12:20.700 --> 02:12:24.300
focused the third house in this chart is


2629
02:12:23.300 --> 02:12:25.900
not focused on the third.


2630
02:12:29.200 --> 02:12:32.200
Let's just do it here because this is him throwing myself off with


2631
02:12:32.200 --> 02:12:36.600
the empty second house one. The second house ruler is not


2632
02:12:36.600 --> 02:12:39.300
in the second house. So money is not concerned with


2633
02:12:39.300 --> 02:12:39.600
money.


2634
02:12:40.600 --> 02:12:41.100
money


2635
02:12:42.100 --> 02:12:43.200
It's ruler.


2636
02:12:43.900 --> 02:12:46.500
Is in the 11th house, so anything money


2637
02:12:46.500 --> 02:12:49.800
has to do with how how groups


2638
02:12:49.800 --> 02:12:50.800
are impacted.


2639
02:12:52.100 --> 02:12:55.500
So making money has to do with it's always made


2640
02:12:55.500 --> 02:12:57.700
through groups. It's always made through here.


2641
02:12:58.500 --> 02:13:00.800
The reverse ruler is


2642
02:13:02.500 --> 02:13:04.300
what is impacting money?


2643
02:13:05.900 --> 02:13:08.300
Does that make sense what is coming in


2644
02:13:08.300 --> 02:13:10.200
versus what is going out?


2645
02:13:11.200 --> 02:13:15.000
Money is always made through here. But money is is coming


2646
02:13:14.300 --> 02:13:16.100
from the third house.


2647
02:13:16.900 --> 02:13:19.300
Comes from the third house. And then in order to make it


2648
02:13:19.300 --> 02:13:22.700
is pushed up through the 11th house. It's just


2649
02:13:22.700 --> 02:13:25.400
the directionality of the ruler. It's coming


2650
02:13:25.400 --> 02:13:27.500
from here and it's going to here.


2651
02:13:29.800 --> 02:13:32.700
So if we're talking about home life work is


2652
02:13:32.700 --> 02:13:33.400
brought home.


2653
02:13:35.100 --> 02:13:37.600
Or you read it as at home, there's work.


2654
02:13:38.600 --> 02:13:41.100
Right because it's coming in as opposed to


2655
02:13:41.100 --> 02:13:44.300
the other way around same thing. By the way with orbs of


2656
02:13:44.300 --> 02:13:47.200
influence. Let me touch on that real quick is orbs of influences are


2657
02:13:47.200 --> 02:13:48.000
good one here Jupiter.


2658
02:13:49.600 --> 02:13:53.000
The biggest thing that I forgot to mention about orbs of


2659
02:13:52.200 --> 02:13:55.200
influence here is that when you're


2660
02:13:55.200 --> 02:13:58.200
at 27 degrees or even one degree with the


2661
02:13:58.200 --> 02:14:01.100
moon over here that the moon goes two to three degrees,


2662
02:14:01.100 --> 02:14:05.000
but it's only one degree left which means two


2663
02:14:04.300 --> 02:14:07.300
to three or one to two degrees of it is


2664
02:14:07.300 --> 02:14:10.500
over here in the third house. So the


2665
02:14:10.500 --> 02:14:13.400
moon in Taurus in the fourth house is pulling


2666
02:14:13.400 --> 02:14:16.400
its energy into communication.


2667
02:14:17.600 --> 02:14:20.100
So when your home your communicating?


2668
02:14:21.200 --> 02:14:24.600
And the things that are happening at home end up in your communication.


2669
02:14:26.200 --> 02:14:28.700
Which is different than you communicating about home.


2670
02:14:29.600 --> 02:14:32.100
It is things at home ends up


2671
02:14:32.100 --> 02:14:35.100
pushing you towards communication and then because of its


2672
02:14:35.100 --> 02:14:38.400
orb of influence it would be including Chiron.


2673
02:14:39.200 --> 02:14:42.500
So positively it's healing negatively with


2674
02:14:42.500 --> 02:14:45.200
this this orb of influence with the moon


2675
02:14:45.200 --> 02:14:48.400
and Chiron you're talking about emotional like deep


2676
02:14:48.400 --> 02:14:51.700
emotional pain from the mother based on communication because


2677
02:14:51.700 --> 02:14:54.300
it's pulling here and moving This Way


2678
02:14:54.300 --> 02:14:57.500
Jupiter is doing it the other way. It's at 27 degrees,


2679
02:14:57.500 --> 02:15:00.800
but we know that there's a seven to eight degree orb of influence meaning.


2680
02:15:00.800 --> 02:15:03.400
It's at 27, you know,


2681
02:15:03.400 --> 02:15:06.400
I'm ignoring the minutes for right now. It's a little


2682
02:15:06.400 --> 02:15:09.100
less than three degrees going this way, which means we've got about


2683
02:15:09.100 --> 02:15:13.200
five degrees into the fifth house. So things of home when


2684
02:15:13.200 --> 02:15:16.900
it comes to things that are taught things that are learned culture


2685
02:15:16.900 --> 02:15:19.300
is all spilled into Fun and Games.


2686
02:15:19.300 --> 02:15:22.500
It's all spilled into the way you communicate and your


2687
02:15:22.500 --> 02:15:25.300
sense of humor. It all comes from your mother and your home


2688
02:15:25.300 --> 02:15:28.200
and your family, especially when it comes to like things


2689
02:15:28.200 --> 02:15:29.000
that are cultural.


2690
02:15:30.200 --> 02:15:33.500
And a lot of that is influenced by, you know


2691
02:15:33.500 --> 02:15:35.700
chores daily work and things like that.


2692
02:15:39.800 --> 02:15:40.800
Hope that answers that.


2693
02:15:42.700 --> 02:15:45.400
Since we're an examples, could we


2694
02:15:45.400 --> 02:15:47.300
do a serial killer like Ted buddy? No.


2695
02:15:48.100 --> 02:15:51.400
I don't do famous people. The reason


2696
02:15:51.400 --> 02:15:53.800
why I chose a random first off I wouldn't.


2697
02:15:55.800 --> 02:15:58.700
When people do famous people they always


2698
02:15:58.700 --> 02:16:01.400
make it make sense based


2699
02:16:01.400 --> 02:16:04.700
off of their interpretation or their not interpretation.


2700
02:16:04.700 --> 02:16:07.400
But their idea of what that person's like


2701
02:16:07.400 --> 02:16:10.400
their opinion. It's always plays out their way every


2702
02:16:10.400 --> 02:16:13.500
tiktok video every YouTube video every single example I've ever


2703
02:16:13.500 --> 02:16:16.200
seen it's always like well Pluto is sitting here


2704
02:16:16.200 --> 02:16:19.100
squaring Vesta in the sixth house. So, you know,


2705
02:16:19.100 --> 02:16:22.400
they, you know, couldn't you know live and you


2706
02:16:22.400 --> 02:16:25.900
know, their family was just like horrible and


2707
02:16:25.900 --> 02:16:29.200
you know the marriage here, even


2708
02:16:28.200 --> 02:16:31.300
though there was a marriage, you know,


2709
02:16:31.300 --> 02:16:35.000
it was just a show and I'm just like you're just


2710
02:16:34.400 --> 02:16:37.500
pulling that out of your butt and just


2711
02:16:37.500 --> 02:16:40.600
saying things that kind of go with the planets.


2712
02:16:41.400 --> 02:16:44.400
You're not talking like what I just said doesn't make


2713
02:16:44.400 --> 02:16:47.200
any sense with a sex tile because a sex tile would


2714
02:16:47.200 --> 02:16:50.300
actually feed harmoniously through hidden talent through here and


2715
02:16:50.300 --> 02:16:53.500
the North Node would mean that moving forward in


2716
02:16:53.500 --> 02:16:56.800
the future would be you know much better. But because


2717
02:16:56.800 --> 02:16:59.200
of you know, that's what they do is


2718
02:16:59.200 --> 02:17:02.900
they'll see this and then they'll go into like degree here Ted Bundy


2719
02:17:02.900 --> 02:17:05.900
had a you know, a 22 degree Mars and


2720
02:17:05.900 --> 02:17:09.200
we all know what that means. It's like no that's that's


2721
02:17:08.200 --> 02:17:11.400
nonsense. I'm surprised I don't have a 22


2722
02:17:11.400 --> 02:17:14.800
degree sitting right here. I got 24 and a 23 and


2723
02:17:14.800 --> 02:17:17.900
another 24, but it's like is there


2724
02:17:17.900 --> 02:17:19.100
an 18 in this person's chart?


2725
02:17:20.700 --> 02:17:24.100
Surprisingly not but it's like these


2726
02:17:23.100 --> 02:17:26.400
people are always like 18 to 22


2727
02:17:26.400 --> 02:17:29.700
or terrible degrees. You know, how often how many chances you


2728
02:17:29.700 --> 02:17:32.400
have for an 18 or 22 just so happens that this


2729
02:17:32.400 --> 02:17:35.100
example doesn't have one. But if we were to like


2730
02:17:35.900 --> 02:17:38.500
Switch the day. I'm sure we'd come up with something.


2731
02:17:38.500 --> 02:17:39.300
Let's just


2732
02:17:41.500 --> 02:17:42.800
let's just go here and here.


2733
02:17:44.700 --> 02:17:47.400
Just go to some random person see if it happens.


2734
02:17:50.200 --> 02:17:52.100
Of course while I'm doing is not going to do it.


2735
02:17:55.600 --> 02:17:56.400
I know how to do that.


2736
02:17:58.500 --> 02:18:02.500
Do do do do 20.


2737
02:18:07.600 --> 02:18:09.000
Let's just flip you around.


2738
02:18:10.900 --> 02:18:12.300
And we went too far boo.


2739
02:18:15.200 --> 02:18:18.100
Sorry, I know that I can make it happen, which is


2740
02:18:18.100 --> 02:18:21.100
a kind of goes to my point that you can fiddle around with


2741
02:18:21.100 --> 02:18:22.200
this just enough.


2742
02:18:23.700 --> 02:18:26.200
to make it make it, you know be whatever you want and


2743
02:18:26.200 --> 02:18:28.400
but that again that's the reason why I don't use


2744
02:18:29.700 --> 02:18:32.700
I don't do famous people, you know, I did I


2745
02:18:32.700 --> 02:18:35.300
did like hurricanes. I did a hurricane


2746
02:18:35.300 --> 02:18:38.200
once and the feedback that I got on that people


2747
02:18:38.200 --> 02:18:39.600
were like, oh you're lying. Oh you're


2748
02:18:41.400 --> 02:18:44.500
insensitive and I'm like why because I everything played


2749
02:18:44.500 --> 02:18:47.000
out the way I said, you know, it's just like


2750
02:18:48.300 --> 02:18:51.000
just because it didn't play out the way you wanted it to play


2751
02:18:51.400 --> 02:18:54.300
out or you're listening to the media which is funny because


2752
02:18:54.300 --> 02:18:54.700
the last


2753
02:18:55.700 --> 02:18:58.300
The last one I did on a hurricane like it.


2754
02:18:58.300 --> 02:19:01.700
It definitely said that media was going to be an issue.


2755
02:19:03.100 --> 02:19:05.800
That they were gonna lie and they did lie over and over.


2756
02:19:09.500 --> 02:19:12.700
Anyway, I could fit around with this and I could get this a


2757
02:19:12.700 --> 02:19:15.200
little bit closer and give you a


2758
02:19:16.200 --> 02:19:17.700
I'm almost there. I may as well just do it.


2759
02:19:18.400 --> 02:19:19.800
and give you a


2760
02:19:20.800 --> 02:19:21.700
Of course. I miss it.


2761
02:19:24.500 --> 02:19:27.500
Come on, just give it to him. There you go. Boom 22 degree


2762
02:19:27.500 --> 02:19:30.200
Moon. Guess this person is a serial killer took me


2763
02:19:30.200 --> 02:19:31.400
a second to get it, but there it is.


2764
02:19:32.200 --> 02:19:35.200
And you know a couple minutes over this,


2765
02:19:35.200 --> 02:19:38.400
you know minutes before this could have been a 22 degree part of


2766
02:19:38.400 --> 02:19:41.200
Fortunes. Like they're they're lucky sillier serial killer. It


2767
02:19:41.200 --> 02:19:41.900
just doesn't work that way.


2768
02:19:42.900 --> 02:19:45.100
I'm not covering nodes in the


2769
02:19:45.100 --> 02:19:45.600
next class.


2770
02:19:46.700 --> 02:19:50.400
Nodes are going to be a separate


2771
02:19:50.400 --> 02:19:53.300
class. They're not part of this the first five


2772
02:19:53.300 --> 02:19:56.100
classes. I will be doing a separate one all about


2773
02:19:56.100 --> 02:19:59.900
the moon actually because in that class I'll be covering the moon


2774
02:19:59.900 --> 02:20:02.900
Lilith where you at little


2775
02:20:02.900 --> 02:20:05.300
it right here, and then the nodes.


2776
02:20:05.900 --> 02:20:08.400
In that class because there's a lot to talk about with all


2777
02:20:08.400 --> 02:20:11.200
of those that we don't talk about enough.


2778
02:20:12.400 --> 02:20:15.200
So that'll be its own class.


2779
02:20:17.100 --> 02:20:17.200
Yeah.


2780
02:20:26.100 --> 02:20:29.300
Pisces and Virgo. Yeah, we'd have to do that separately.


2781
02:20:31.900 --> 02:20:34.400
22 degrees is supposedly I can't remember now


2782
02:20:34.400 --> 02:20:37.200
because they're both ridiculous 18 and 22. One of them


2783
02:20:37.200 --> 02:20:40.700
is a serial killer one's a killer be killed like these


2784
02:20:40.700 --> 02:20:44.000
people are like constantly having near-death experiences


2785
02:20:43.200 --> 02:20:46.100
or whatever. It doesn't play out. That way. I've done


2786
02:20:46.100 --> 02:20:49.700
plenty of charts with 18 and 22 where neither


2787
02:20:49.700 --> 02:20:54.000
of those things were true. It's it's degree


2788
02:20:52.300 --> 02:20:55.400
Theory. It's bunk. It's


2789
02:20:55.400 --> 02:20:58.300
fake. It's crap. It's pop culture


2790
02:20:58.300 --> 02:21:00.600
astrology. It's a bunch of people on


2791
02:21:01.900 --> 02:21:04.200
There you go, Melissa. I have 22 degrees


2792
02:21:04.200 --> 02:21:07.100
Scorpio. Definitely not a killer. You know what? I mean? It's


2793
02:21:07.100 --> 02:21:07.400
just like


2794
02:21:09.700 --> 02:21:12.500
it's such nonsense again. How many


2795
02:21:12.500 --> 02:21:13.100
chances?


2796
02:21:14.100 --> 02:21:17.500
Do you have for like the mid heaven to end at 22? I


2797
02:21:17.500 --> 02:21:20.400
could get the mid Heaven at 22 degrees actually and still have


2798
02:21:20.400 --> 02:21:23.200
the moon probably at 22 degrees here. It's like


2799
02:21:24.200 --> 02:21:27.100
All these planets you have all these chances for it to


2800
02:21:27.100 --> 02:21:27.300
be there.


2801
02:21:28.100 --> 02:21:31.500
Forward rulership of fourth house has to do with identity third


2802
02:21:31.500 --> 02:21:34.500
house in Reverse rulership where comes from work. So


2803
02:21:34.500 --> 02:21:37.300
work filters into identity in the


2804
02:21:37.300 --> 02:21:40.200
home. Yes that not on


2805
02:21:40.200 --> 02:21:44.000
this obviously, but the one we were working with. Yes, that's exactly how


2806
02:21:43.200 --> 02:21:44.400
that works.


2807
02:21:45.600 --> 02:21:48.200
So now that's how you tie it all together. That's all


2808
02:21:48.200 --> 02:21:51.300
the Q&amp;A I have over here. Unless anybody has a last-minute one,


2809
02:21:51.300 --> 02:21:53.700
but that's how you tie it all together and


2810
02:21:55.100 --> 02:21:58.200
This is how when we when you add


2811
02:21:58.200 --> 02:22:02.000
in aspects and we add in and transits


2812
02:22:01.100 --> 02:22:04.400
are separately separate. I'm going to try


2813
02:22:04.400 --> 02:22:07.300
to make sure I get transits in but trans it's


2814
02:22:07.300 --> 02:22:10.200
a pretty easy because transits are based off of aspects as


2815
02:22:10.200 --> 02:22:13.700
well. So once I teach aspects then transits will


2816
02:22:13.700 --> 02:22:16.100
make a lot more sense, but the bulk of


2817
02:22:16.100 --> 02:22:18.000
the focus in the next class is aspects.


2818
02:22:18.900 --> 02:22:21.300
And then after that it's like putting it


2819
02:22:21.300 --> 02:22:24.500
all together and then after that it's manifesting abundance. So


2820
02:22:24.500 --> 02:22:29.000
we are working our way through this and orbs


2821
02:22:27.100 --> 02:22:30.900
of influence understanding that


2822
02:22:30.900 --> 02:22:33.200
you know moon is two to three degrees which means


2823
02:22:33.200 --> 02:22:36.500
series which is a is like a mother earth kind


2824
02:22:36.500 --> 02:22:37.200
of nurturing.


2825
02:22:39.100 --> 02:22:40.100
asteroid here


2826
02:22:41.300 --> 02:22:44.500
that these two are connected that this type


2827
02:22:44.500 --> 02:22:47.700
this person would be extremely nurturing on


2828
02:22:47.700 --> 02:22:49.900
a very Earthly level.


2829
02:22:50.800 --> 02:22:53.200
Cooking cleaning like just taking


2830
02:22:53.200 --> 02:22:56.900
care of things like wanting the food to be healthy things


2831
02:22:56.900 --> 02:22:57.200
like that.


2832
02:22:58.300 --> 02:23:01.100
In the eighth house, they would do so in in a


2833
02:23:01.100 --> 02:23:05.500
potentially manipulative way. You wouldn't get to know that not everybody


2834
02:23:05.500 --> 02:23:08.400
would see this in Capricorn there would be structure to


2835
02:23:08.400 --> 02:23:11.800
this. So the things that they do have to have hierarchy they


2836
02:23:11.800 --> 02:23:15.400
are the authority when it comes to nurturing when


2837
02:23:15.400 --> 02:23:19.100
it comes to taking care of and this person might have with the


2838
02:23:19.100 --> 02:23:22.600
eighth house here might have could be


2839
02:23:22.600 --> 02:23:25.700
psychology and then we would look obviously we're Saturn


2840
02:23:25.700 --> 02:23:28.100
is we're cancer is Cancers and the second house. So


2841
02:23:28.100 --> 02:23:29.500
make this is how they would make money.


2842
02:23:30.700 --> 02:23:34.100
And then there's more to it and then Capricorn Saturn


2843
02:23:33.100 --> 02:23:36.100
is in the third house in Leo.


2844
02:23:37.300 --> 02:23:39.600
So it could be a child therapist.


2845
02:23:40.700 --> 02:23:40.900
here


2846
02:23:44.300 --> 02:23:47.300
and it's the rule of the twelfth house repressed memories. This


2847
02:23:47.300 --> 02:23:48.400
could be a child therapist.


2848
02:23:49.400 --> 02:23:52.100
So again, that's again how you kind of


2849
02:23:52.100 --> 02:23:56.100
dig deep and figure it out. And the one


2850
02:23:55.100 --> 02:23:58.100
thing I just want to remind you guys before I


2851
02:23:58.100 --> 02:23:59.900
answer the last questions is


2852
02:24:00.800 --> 02:24:03.800
When you guys are doing these charts do not get overwhelmed


2853
02:24:03.800 --> 02:24:06.200
by all of this information. This is


2854
02:24:06.200 --> 02:24:06.700
everything.


2855
02:24:07.500 --> 02:24:10.400
And you never look at everything to do things. You don't


2856
02:24:10.400 --> 02:24:13.400
look at every single aspect every single


2857
02:24:13.400 --> 02:24:15.900
place and everything. You have to look at. What's the question?


2858
02:24:17.100 --> 02:24:20.300
Everything has to have a question. Even if you're reading a natal chart. What's the


2859
02:24:20.300 --> 02:24:23.100
question the question is? What what's the first


2860
02:24:23.100 --> 02:24:26.400
house? That is the question so I don't need to worry about any


2861
02:24:26.400 --> 02:24:29.100
of this other crap none of these lines, by the way. I don't


2862
02:24:29.100 --> 02:24:31.200
use these lines, but I'll talk about that next time.


2863
02:24:32.300 --> 02:24:35.100
There are very quick reference for me. But all I care about


2864
02:24:35.100 --> 02:24:38.300
is who's this person fundamentally when


2865
02:24:38.300 --> 02:24:41.300
I'm looking at the first house and all I really have to know is are there


2866
02:24:41.300 --> 02:24:44.400
any aspects to the ascendant? I can either look around the chart or


2867
02:24:44.400 --> 02:24:47.800
I can just look at this line here that says AC and


2868
02:24:47.800 --> 02:24:50.700
look across and it only matters from about here


2869
02:24:50.700 --> 02:24:53.700
left. Right? So I see an inconjunction


2870
02:24:53.700 --> 02:24:56.300
we're gonna talk about these aspects but I see some aspects there right?


2871
02:24:56.300 --> 02:24:59.700
So I need to know those to understand this person and


2872
02:24:59.700 --> 02:25:02.500
then I need to know Mercury and it's placement which


2873
02:25:02.500 --> 02:25:05.700
is in the second house. So this person cares about money and they


2874
02:25:05.700 --> 02:25:08.900
care about money for their family and doing so through nurturing and


2875
02:25:08.900 --> 02:25:11.400
whatnot. And there's higher education involved and


2876
02:25:11.400 --> 02:25:14.400
that's the other way. You read it. So you read it first by what do


2877
02:25:14.400 --> 02:25:18.200
these planets mean? Okay, son creativity children


2878
02:25:17.200 --> 02:25:20.400
and other


2879
02:25:20.400 --> 02:25:26.000
things Mercury thought process communication Jupiter philosophy


2880
02:25:24.600 --> 02:25:27.800
higher education travel culture.


2881
02:25:28.700 --> 02:25:31.100
So I already know that so right that down on my


2882
02:25:31.100 --> 02:25:34.400
little list and then where did the Sun come from? Where is


2883
02:25:34.400 --> 02:25:37.200
Leo? It's over here in the third house. Right? So you break it


2884
02:25:37.200 --> 02:25:40.100
down one at a time. And that's all I need to know


2885
02:25:40.100 --> 02:25:43.600
for this and then once I'm done that clean the


2886
02:25:43.600 --> 02:25:46.200
Slate come back here start on the


2887
02:25:46.200 --> 02:25:49.300
second house. This is if you're doing a full nail chart reading I don't do


2888
02:25:49.300 --> 02:25:53.100
natal chart readings anymore. Why because they're extremely draining.


2889
02:25:52.100 --> 02:25:55.400
I answer questions. What's the


2890
02:25:55.400 --> 02:25:58.200
question? What do you want to know? I want to know


2891
02:25:58.200 --> 02:26:01.100
if I go to school, you know, what should


2892
02:26:01.100 --> 02:26:04.600
I go for usually people have an idea because intuitions is


2893
02:26:04.600 --> 02:26:07.100
here, but I know that schooling has to do with the


2894
02:26:07.100 --> 02:26:10.100
ninth house. So I'll read that I know Sagittarius has to


2895
02:26:10.100 --> 02:26:13.300
do with it. And I know that Jupiter has to do with it. So I take this


2896
02:26:14.200 --> 02:26:17.100
And its ruler ships I take this and its rule


2897
02:26:17.100 --> 02:26:20.800
of ships and I take this in this rule of ships. And then that is how I answer what's


2898
02:26:20.800 --> 02:26:23.700
good for them for schooling. I don't care about anything else.


2899
02:26:23.700 --> 02:26:26.400
I don't care about Chiron in in the


2900
02:26:26.400 --> 02:26:29.500
12th house in terms of this I do because


2901
02:26:29.500 --> 02:26:31.900
there's a seven and eight so it's squaring but


2902
02:26:32.900 --> 02:26:35.100
Aside from that I don't care and then I


2903
02:26:35.100 --> 02:26:38.900
just break it down. One thing at a time. We talk about one thing at a time until we


2904
02:26:38.900 --> 02:26:41.400
get through an hour reading and we've gone deep into


2905
02:26:41.400 --> 02:26:44.800
the the thing. I don't analyze the entire chart and


2906
02:26:44.800 --> 02:26:47.100
then give you all the information it wants because


2907
02:26:47.100 --> 02:26:48.900
I never remember that neither would you?


2908
02:26:49.800 --> 02:26:51.900
So don't get overwhelmed don't get flustered.


2909
02:26:52.700 --> 02:26:54.100
Just take it one thing at a time.


2910
02:26:55.400 --> 02:26:58.700
So much for this. I know I ask a million questions you do


2911
02:26:58.700 --> 02:27:01.200
you do but that's good. So I can't begin


2912
02:27:01.200 --> 02:27:04.200
to explain how much I appreciate you. Thank you all thank you


2913
02:27:04.200 --> 02:27:05.300
Taylor. I appreciate that.


2914
02:27:07.100 --> 02:27:10.400
Angela can't thank you enough for this class. It will be a long


2915
02:27:10.400 --> 02:27:13.200
two weeks before your next class like a kid eating for Christmas


2916
02:27:13.200 --> 02:27:15.900
waiting for Christmas, Angela.


2917
02:27:17.300 --> 02:27:20.100
I'm trying to get other classes. I know that I


2918
02:27:20.100 --> 02:27:24.400
want to teach like Astro cartography relocation astrology sinistry,


2919
02:27:23.400 --> 02:27:26.800
and I'm


2920
02:27:26.800 --> 02:27:29.200
not ready to do medical astrology but that's coming soon as


2921
02:27:29.200 --> 02:27:32.600
I figure some things out. But like I said the asteroids and


2922
02:27:32.600 --> 02:27:35.800
there's just so much to learn and then diving deeper


2923
02:27:35.800 --> 02:27:38.500
into each one is just a lot of fun and doing like


2924
02:27:38.500 --> 02:27:41.200
I said one-on-one practice. It's going


2925
02:27:41.200 --> 02:27:41.900
to be great. So


2926
02:27:42.700 --> 02:27:45.900

2927
02:27:45.900 --> 02:27:48.700

2928
02:27:48.700 --> 02:27:51.300
I do want it to be relatable. But at the same time got to


2929
02:27:51.300 --> 02:27:51.600
make it work.


2930
