1
00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:03.700
So welcome everybody to my first class which is understanding


2
00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:07.200
the basics. I'm going to be taking you through just


3
00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:09.700
a couple of things before we start looking at anything just


4
00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:12.200
so that everyone's clear on why I'm doing


5
00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.700
this and what I expect you


6
00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:18.300
guys to get out of this and where we


7
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.100
go from here. So astrology is obviously something a lot


8
00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:25.500
of people are interested and there's a lot of you know,


9
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.400
fake stuff out there and we always see these


10
00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:31.900
horoscopes and that's actually why I got into it was


11
00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:34.300
too debunk these horoscopes. I


12
00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:37.500
thought you know, I've always been to into astrology like most


13
00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:37.900
of my life.


14
00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:42.200
And I saw these horoscopes and it really


15
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:45.400
starting to bother me and I was like, you know the cannot be right. So I


16
00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:48.500
started looking into them and dove into astrology and


17
00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.300
at first it like I was doing real good. I


18
00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.200
had the wrong birth time my wife had


19
00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:55.800
the wrong birth time and


20
00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.300
I was also using plastidis health system and I'm gonna get into that in


21
00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:04.400
a minute. So I know a lot of you already have


22
00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.600
a foundation in astrology. Maybe you're just looking to


23
00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.500
kind of brush up and pick up a few details some of


24
00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.600
you who are here attending this class have no astrological


25
00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.300
background whatsoever. So I'm


26
00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:20.200
going to be pretending as though you don't so I've


27
00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.300
said this a few in my lives when


28
00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:23.300
I do live readings.


29
00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.700
I've I'm trying to take it back to where there were


30
00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.400
moments when I used to teach martial arts and as a


31
00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:33.700
black belt it was really hard to kind of go back and


32
00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:37.000
remember what it was like to be a white belt to remember.


33
00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:41.700
Like to remember how things.


34
00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.200
I'm gonna double record this to remember


35
00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.200
how things felt when you when you


36
00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.200
don't know what the next thing is. You don't know the first thing you


37
00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.700
don't know stances. You don't even know why you're wearing this uniform, you


38
00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.600
know what you want and you know, you want self-defense you


39
00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.800
want discipline. Whatever. The reason is you want to go


40
00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:06.000
in and you want to have


41
00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.200
there's something you want to get out of it. So that's what I'm


42
00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.400
gonna try to do is bring it back down. You guys are my astrology white


43
00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.200
belts and I'm gonna try to take you through


44
00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.000
the front stance the down block and everything.


45
00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.500
So when I got into this this journey of


46
00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.600
trying to debunk astrology it


47
00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.300
obviously it didn't work because here I am teaching you guys


48
00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:32.200
astrology but using the wrong


49
00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.100
things and then kind of finagling my way. I did a


50
00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:38.200
lot of testing on people who'd find random people in the street and be like, hey,


51
00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.500
can I do you know your birth time and then I would practice and


52
00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.300
they would it would be more of a conversation where


53
00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:47.300
they give me feedback and I'd be like, you know, I'm trying to learn this and like


54
00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:50.100
what happened here and how did this play out? And it was


55
00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:53.400
a lot of that it was not a lot of textbook stuff.


56
00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.700
It was a lot of like I need to learn what Mercury means


57
00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.700
I need to know what Aquarius means but I knew


58
00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.400
there was more to it once I started getting into it and things started


59
00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.200
clicking and the more details. I got the more


60
00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.300
into what I got the more things started to make sense and then of


61
00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.300
course


62
00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:13.400
It got to the point. Okay. Well, I know how to read astrology now.


63
00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.200
What do I do with it? And this is


64
00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.100
this is what I want for you guys by the end of


65
00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:21.600
this is one of seven classes in this course and this is a Basics


66
00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.900
course. This is a there are


67
00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:28.000
things that even even if you're an advanced astrologer intermediate


68
00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.200
that you're gonna take from this course and be able


69
00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:33.400
to apply and that's the purpose is I'm going to keep it as simple as possible here.


70
00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:37.200
Eventually. I'll be doing additional classes shortly after


71
00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:38.400
this. This one's over.


72
00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:43.100
Where I focus in on very specific details very specific


73
00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:45.600
themes and topics in astrology, but I


74
00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:48.400
want to make this class relatable. I want you to


75
00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:51.200
be able to take this information and actually apply


76
00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:53.900
it I want it to feel basic. I wanted to feel like


77
00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:58.600
you're grasping it as I go now, obviously this isn't one-on-one. I


78
00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:01.100
do at the time of recording this. Anyway, I do


79
00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:05.300
offer one-on-one coaching for teaching


80
00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:07.200
astrology and that'll be up on our site


81
00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:10.400
soon. But I took it down because I knew I


82
00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:11.400
was doing this first so


83
00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:15.200
That's why I got into it. I went to debunk. It


84
00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:17.400
didn't work went through my journey and


85
00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:21.200
learned a lot about myself and then you know,


86
00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:24.500
we live our lives myself my


87
00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:27.200
wife my family using astrology using


88
00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:30.600
tarot using other esoteric studies. We use this


89
00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:33.700
astrology in this information to make daily decisions.


90
00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:37.200
There are some things that we know happen. And


91
00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:39.100
then sometimes we try to work with the


92
00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:42.800
energies some energies are very difficult to work with good example


93
00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:46.000
as I went live this morning, but everything for


94
00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:49.200
this Mercury retrograde went bad and


95
00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:51.300
I knew I only had three days left so it is


96
00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:54.500
slowing down but it's towards the end where it's gonna become stagnant again,


97
00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:57.700
so it's hard to move forward with the energy but I chose


98
00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:00.400
this date for this class because I knew I could work through it.


99
00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:03.200
Anyway given where all of my placements were


100
00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:04.900
specifically my moon placement.


101
00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:08.300
I won't be talking about that in this class. But in this


102
00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:11.500
course we will be talking about transits and I think that's extremely important.


103
00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:14.100
You guys are gonna learn a lot about transits orbs of


104
00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:14.800
influence. Which means


105
00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:19.600
There's a planet how far out does its energy actually go


106
00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:22.300
how far is its reach. So when you're


107
00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:25.400
talking about your own planets or you're talking about Transit planets,


108
00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:28.300
your own planets are the moment you were


109
00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:31.300
born in the time date and place. That's why those


110
00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:33.400
are the three things that you need time date and place.


111
00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:37.200
What's the cosmic imprint that is


112
00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:40.500
the blueprint of your life your Cosmic DNA is


113
00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:43.600
your natal chart and I'm going to show you mine. I


114
00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:46.900
went back and forth. I was like I could use a famous person. I


115
00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:49.700
could use somebody in the class I could use but I


116
00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:52.300
can make up some person but I decided just to use my own


117
00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:55.400
and I'm not going to use too much life experience. Although I will


118
00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:58.100
throw some of those in but I'm gonna use it just so you can see


119
00:05:58.100 --> 00:05:59.900
how the placements are and how they play out.


120
00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:04.800
There are different types of astrology out


121
00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:04.900
there.


122
00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:08.400
I do not study a specific type of


123
00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:11.500
astrology. What I did was I pulled


124
00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:13.700
up hundreds of


125
00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:18.300
Of sources, mostly online some physical


126
00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:21.000
books, but mostly online sources including Believe It or Not


127
00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:25.000
Tumblr a lot of really good nuggets on Tumblr


128
00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:27.500
and I pulled it together and I cross


129
00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:30.400
referenced all of these websites to determine what


130
00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:33.700
information was accurate and what didn't feel right


131
00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:36.400
based off of what I knew. So when you get into


132
00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:39.300
it, you're learning the planets you're learning the signs and that's what most


133
00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:43.000
of this class is going to these and when you talking to you about the energies and


134
00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:45.000
before I talk to you about the energies,


135
00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:48.700
Just understanding. What type of course this is you


136
00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:51.500
are going to be learning My Method my way.


137
00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:55.200
Of reading and I don't have a name for it or anything


138
00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:58.800
like that. It's just right now. It's just the Mystic Rebels Academy Rebel Academy


139
00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:01.600
way of doing it and maybe one day I'll coin


140
00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:05.000
a cool term, but I don't have one now and I it really


141
00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:07.300
doesn't matter. It's Logan's way. And then


142
00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:10.400
what I want for you is once you guys get through this clip this


143
00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:13.300
course any other courses any other studies is


144
00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:16.900
for you guys to be able to go out on your own and


145
00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:20.100
create your own methods your


146
00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:23.800
own tests your own theories and trials because


147
00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:24.900
that's the fun part.


148
00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:28.400
the thing about astrology, I think that bugs


149
00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:29.100
me the most


150
00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:33.700
Aside from pop culture astrology at which


151
00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:36.600
is, you know, Libras don't like Geminis or


152
00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:39.600
they wouldn't say that because they're they're trying but libraiths don't


153
00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:42.300
like cancers or you know, I'm a Scorpio.


154
00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:45.400
So I'm just secretive and it's like they use


155
00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:48.400
it to explain away their behaviors as opposed


156
00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:50.900
to growing and spiritually continuing on their path.


157
00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:54.500
But aside from that it's the limiting nature


158
00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:57.400
of astrology as it as it


159
00:07:57.400 --> 00:07:57.800
exists today.


160
00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:02.000
There are different methods and people take


161
00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:04.800
that textbook method and they


162
00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:07.600
say that that's it. It kind of treat it like the Bible. That's it.


163
00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:10.300
There's nothing else. You cannot expand your mind


164
00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:10.800
Beyond this.


165
00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:14.200
And you know, they they have these fights with


166
00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:17.400
people, you know, I've gotten into these like and I just walk away. I'm


167
00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:20.100
like this is not worth my time, but they'll sit there


168
00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:23.800
and fight with you and you're like no look I've done it. I've done thousands


169
00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:26.200
of charts. I do it and this is what I've seen like, well that's not


170
00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:26.800
the way it is.


171
00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:28.700
And it's like well.


172
00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:30.600
I do what works.


173
00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:34.500
I don't know what to tell you. So I'm not gonna regurgitate what


174
00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:37.600
you can find on Google too much. I'm not gonna regurgitate too


175
00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:40.200
much what you find in textbooks. I'm just gonna teach you what I know


176
00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:43.500
and we're gonna go from there energy. I think


177
00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:45.000
is important to understand because


178
00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:47.900
When you're learning how to do.


179
00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:53.400
when you're learning how to do all these charts and this right


180
00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:53.800
here is


181
00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:55.800
my chart


182
00:08:56.700 --> 00:08:59.000
when you're learning this and you see this chart here.


183
00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:02.500
The first thing you usually end up thinking.


184
00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:07.000
is water all those signs what


185
00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:09.700
are all those different, you


186
00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:11.700
know symbols that you see on the


187
00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:16.100
on the screen right now and all of these has


188
00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:20.300
a meaning all these has a very specific set of energies, but


189
00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:22.400
when people see this each one is in


190
00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:25.700
a position. Like I said, it's the moment. It's the time the place


191
00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:27.100
and the date.


192
00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:31.800
Right. So I guess time and date are are the moment but the


193
00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:34.800
place is very specific as well. So I was born in


194
00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:37.500
Baltimore Maryland on June 12th in 1982 at


195
00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:40.700
9:49. Am so this is my information


196
00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:43.300
that you plug in you end up getting this


197
00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:46.400
chart here. I am a Leo Rising we're going to talk about all


198
00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:46.700
of this.


199
00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:50.700
Once I get through the houses, I'm going to come back to the angles which


200
00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:51.500
are extremely important.


201
00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:56.300
These each one of these has a degree


202
00:09:56.300 --> 00:09:59.600
these degrees do matter and the reason


203
00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:02.400
why your birth time is so important is because it


204
00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:05.100
does move certain things in your chart based on


205
00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:08.700
if you were born in the morning in the afternoon and it can


206
00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:11.400
determine based on that. It determines if some of


207
00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:14.200
your planet sit in the daytime or if they sit in


208
00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:17.100
the nighttime, it will actually determine if you're


209
00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:20.500
more of a introverted or extroverted person


210
00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:23.200
if you're more of a self-starter or someone who


211
00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:24.800
needs motivation from other people


212
00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:28.600
And those are hemispheres we will talk about hemispheres in


213
00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:31.200
another class in this course and we'll talk about


214
00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:34.500
a lot of things. I'm going to hint at a few things through this class, which


215
00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:37.600
I'm not going to be talking about too much in this class because they're


216
00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:41.200
going to be safe for another class in this course aspects transits


217
00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:41.500
things like that.


218
00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:45.200
So in this specific class for


219
00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:48.500
this two-hour period we are going to ignore all these lines all these


220
00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:51.400
lines basically show is that a planet has


221
00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:54.100
a relationship with another planet and that is


222
00:10:54.100 --> 00:10:57.300
aspecting so we will talk about aspects and


223
00:10:57.300 --> 00:11:00.200
other in another class because it is a very deep topic and


224
00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:03.300
I definitely don't want to confuse you one day one. What I


225
00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:06.300
want to teach you is the rest of it now when I


226
00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:09.300
talk about and we're gonna get into what's called


227
00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:12.600
orbs of influence, we're gonna get into that later, but


228
00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:15.300
orb of influence is basically if if you


229
00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:18.200
don't remember me saying it earlier is how far out does a


230
00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:21.200
planet reach how far are it's effects and each planet.


231
00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:24.500
It's different each plant has a different size a different reach a different


232
00:11:24.500 --> 00:11:27.400
behavior. And that's why those degrees are so


233
00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:30.200
important because if they're close enough together, that means they affect each


234
00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:33.800
other in a certain way if they're sitting like these two far enough away. That


235
00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:35.400
means they are not affecting each other.


236
00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:39.400
And they are just sitting in the same house occupying the


237
00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:39.900
same space.


238
00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:43.300
That's important to know but I want to point this


239
00:11:43.300 --> 00:11:46.500
out during this class because I want you to think about energy


240
00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:49.100
not as something that's static.


241
00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:52.800
Energy is something that kind of I get


242
00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:56.100
a visual of this like blob, you know,


243
00:11:56.100 --> 00:11:59.300
it's it's tangible, but it's not like you could put your hand through


244
00:11:59.300 --> 00:11:59.500
it.


245
00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:04.500
But it it constantly moves and I see


246
00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:07.600
it like kind of as in a meat as an amoeba that caused that


247
00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:11.100
keeps basically a constant shape, but also pulsates.


248
00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:15.100
And I see it this way because I don't want to


249
00:12:15.100 --> 00:12:18.400
have a fixed view on what


250
00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:19.900
every single one of these energies are.


251
00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:23.400
And this is not a Tarot class. But when you


252
00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:26.100
learn tarot, it's very similar. When you learn that the


253
00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:29.600
definitions of each of the cards. You will


254
00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:32.100
let me see if I can reach one here. What do


255
00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:35.100
we have here? We have Temperance here. Right and Temperance has


256
00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:39.300
a very specific meaning right balance waiting patience. There's


257
00:12:38.300 --> 00:12:41.400
a lot to it and each card is a


258
00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:44.400
little bit different and it's you know, trading off things and whatnot.


259
00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:47.200
This isn't tarot. But this card when it comes


260
00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:50.500
up can mean a lot of things depending on how it


261
00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:51.700
sits in a reading and


262
00:12:53.700 --> 00:12:56.300
And and your intuition in the messages that come


263
00:12:56.300 --> 00:12:59.500
through when I read astrology I use intuition as


264
00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:02.200
well. I listen I open myself up to


265
00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:06.000
the messages because while it is science and math based while


266
00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:08.400
you are reading especially if you're doing this for a client


267
00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:11.700
some of you are doing this because you want to be astrologers and


268
00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:14.400
you can make a living doing this and which is


269
00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:17.300
wonderful some of you are doing this just because you either want


270
00:13:17.300 --> 00:13:20.300
to understand yourself. Maybe you're a parent you want to understand your children.


271
00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:23.200
You want to know when it's a good


272
00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:26.200
time to do certain things. You want to know when I'll say


273
00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:29.400
bad things negative things, you know things that cause emotional


274
00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:33.700
Reactions or situations when they happen what you


275
00:13:33.700 --> 00:13:37.700
can do with it and by the end of this course not


276
00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:39.700
this class, but this course that's what


277
00:13:39.700 --> 00:13:42.200
I want for you and by the end of these seven classes, I want


278
00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:45.400
you to have a basic knowledge to say these are the energies I


279
00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:48.200
can identify them. I understand where they're sitting. I


280
00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:51.700
understand how the relationship the basic relationship with, you


281
00:13:51.700 --> 00:13:54.800
know within each other and then I know that because


282
00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:57.900
they have this energy and they have all these meanings


283
00:13:57.900 --> 00:13:59.900
and they're joined in with this other energy.


284
00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:03.500
It's coming out this way. It's playing out


285
00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:06.800
this way, but it could play out this way.


286
00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:09.400
And all I have to do is interject My Free


287
00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:10.100
Will upon it.


288
00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:14.700
To create whatever I want and that is manifestation part


289
00:14:14.700 --> 00:14:17.800
of it. Anyway, astrological manifestation and


290
00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:20.600
that is divine timing when the planets line


291
00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:23.600
up in such a way that you take advantage of the


292
00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:26.000
energy and move it around. So you


293
00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:28.400
flip that puzzle piece. It's kind of like


294
00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:31.200
a Rubik's Cube


295
00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:35.200
You flip it around. You line it up and you get it to the point


296
00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:38.200
where you you have. All everything is here now. I


297
00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:39.100
want to also explain.


298
00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:40.400
that


299
00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:44.200
I have so many metaphors in my head. I got to just pick


300
00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:47.300
one. I want to explain that manifestation and


301
00:14:47.300 --> 00:14:50.500
astrology is working within the energies that


302
00:14:50.500 --> 00:14:50.800
you have.


303
00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:54.500
That means if you do not have certain energy.


304
00:14:54.500 --> 00:14:57.400
You cannot work with it. If you have


305
00:14:57.400 --> 00:15:00.300
a bunch of Leo energy and nothing in Capricorn and


306
00:15:00.300 --> 00:15:03.500
there's no link. You're not going to be able to use Capricorn energy.


307
00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:06.300
You will be able to use Saturn energy and that will


308
00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:09.000
make more sense by the end of this class, but you won't be able to


309
00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:12.000
use Capricorns house sign energy.


310
00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:16.000
And the best way I think I can explain that is if


311
00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:19.400
you if you're sitting at a


312
00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:21.500
table and someone else is sitting at a table.


313
00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:25.800
And then I put out a box


314
00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:26.500
of screws.


315
00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:30.700
Some paper man. Yeah, so


316
00:15:30.700 --> 00:15:33.300
box of screws some paper glue.


317
00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:39.500
And I'll just leave it at that. I put that around I'm gonna


318
00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:42.300
tell you make make the best thing you can out


319
00:15:42.300 --> 00:15:45.500
of that. Now you cannot aside from the screws.


320
00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:48.200
You can't go around and make something. Well, let's put it this


321
00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:51.600
way. You cannot make something out of wood. You don't have wood you


322
00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:54.200
have paper. I mean technically right it's paper, but


323
00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:57.800
you have paper you have screws and you have glue so you


324
00:15:57.800 --> 00:16:00.400
can't make a huge metal structure. You can't


325
00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:02.100
make a huge wooden structure.


326
00:16:02.700 --> 00:16:05.500
Now what you do make out of it is going


327
00:16:05.500 --> 00:16:08.400
to be different from the next person because you're too Unique Individuals


328
00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:09.400
with your own ideas.


329
00:16:10.900 --> 00:16:12.700
And your own experiences now.


330
00:16:13.700 --> 00:16:16.200
Somebody comes along carrying a box of wood


331
00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:19.800
and walks past you all the sudden the woods


332
00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:22.300
there you can use it or you cannot use


333
00:16:22.300 --> 00:16:25.100
it. But if you need wood to create whatever it is, you're


334
00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:28.300
trying to create you can grab the wood at that time. Now, you couldn't


335
00:16:28.300 --> 00:16:31.300
create it before you can create it now. So you've


336
00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:34.200
made something now you're adding wood in for whatever the structure is


337
00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:37.800
now someone else comes along with a box of metal scraps. Now


338
00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:40.400
you can take that it all has to do a timing


339
00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:43.800
and it all has to do with materials when you translate that


340
00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:47.000
it has to do with when you're talking about these energies


341
00:16:46.100 --> 00:16:50.000
here. If you don't have if the


342
00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:52.400
moon is transiting Leo, then you


343
00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:55.200
have Leo to work with if it's transiting you're ascendant


344
00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:58.700
you have a sentence energy to work with and you have to use this energy


345
00:16:58.700 --> 00:17:01.200
and then when we get into aspects anything that


346
00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:02.300
is connected to it.


347
00:17:03.700 --> 00:17:04.600
This being one.


348
00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:08.300
And I'll talk about this specific one in my chart and how


349
00:17:08.300 --> 00:17:08.900
that played out.


350
00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:10.900
in another class


351
00:17:12.100 --> 00:17:15.500
But I want you to understand that it's all about energy energy is


352
00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:18.500
malleable. It's movable and you can do whatever you


353
00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:21.100
want with it. As long as you stay within the parameters of that


354
00:17:21.100 --> 00:17:21.500
energy.


355
00:17:22.600 --> 00:17:26.000
I've done a few live classes and someone will point


356
00:17:25.100 --> 00:17:28.200
out. Hey, you know, they could just be a nurse


357
00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:31.200
and then I look at the chart and I'm like, well, there's no nurse energy.


358
00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:34.400
There's no service. There's no Virgo. There's no Pisces. There's


359
00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:37.500
no there's nothing there that lines up with it. And


360
00:17:37.500 --> 00:17:40.300
then when they respond, you know on the


361
00:17:40.300 --> 00:17:43.600
live you find out that they're you know in architect or they're a


362
00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:46.200
painter or something like that and that's why it's because


363
00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:49.400
that energy doesn't match that the whole point of astrology is


364
00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:50.800
to understand. I also want to say


365
00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:56.100
before we get into it. I know you guys are just ready to to go.


366
00:17:56.800 --> 00:17:59.500
That astrology is


367
00:17:59.500 --> 00:18:01.800
not although I do believe in.


368
00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:05.300
Faded points and in some


369
00:18:05.300 --> 00:18:08.200
ways Destiny two major takeaways is one.


370
00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:11.400
There's no right way to do your life.


371
00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:14.600
There's no life purpose. There's no


372
00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:17.100
one life purpose. You have multiple things that you're gonna


373
00:18:17.100 --> 00:18:20.300
do multiple stages of your life and you have the choice to


374
00:18:20.300 --> 00:18:23.300
do them. So it makes it difficult when people ask me for life purpose


375
00:18:23.300 --> 00:18:26.200
readings because I'm like, well, what do you want to do? Because we


376
00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:29.100
have to appease this sun energy people who get stuck in


377
00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:32.100
jobs chasing the supposed life purpose forget the fact


378
00:18:32.100 --> 00:18:33.100
that they need to be happy.


379
00:18:34.100 --> 00:18:36.900
The other thing I want to say is that nothing is black and white.


380
00:18:37.900 --> 00:18:40.300
Nothing is set in stone. Nothing


381
00:18:40.300 --> 00:18:41.700
is concrete. However


382
00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:45.600
Energy is tend to in my experience play


383
00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:47.800
out in their lowest vibrational setting.


384
00:18:48.500 --> 00:18:52.900
Until you use them meaning Mars with


385
00:18:51.900 --> 00:18:54.200
Uranus turns into


386
00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:57.400
an accident when it could be something it could


387
00:18:57.400 --> 00:18:58.800
be something revolutionary.


388
00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:03.700
You know Venus with the moon can turn


389
00:19:03.700 --> 00:19:06.400
into sadness or


390
00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:09.700
Mourning depending on how it's aspecting when it


391
00:19:09.700 --> 00:19:12.500
could be a very strong


392
00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:15.600
emotional security and value within


393
00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:16.000
a partner.


394
00:19:16.900 --> 00:19:21.300
And it's all about how you use the energy some aspects


395
00:19:20.300 --> 00:19:23.300
again. We'll get into it. And another class are


396
00:19:23.300 --> 00:19:26.800
going to make it easier to do that. Some are gonna make it more difficult, but the


397
00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:28.300
difficult ones tend to make it.


398
00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:32.300
More impactful meaning when you use those


399
00:19:32.300 --> 00:19:36.000
energies. They create a bigger difference. So


400
00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:38.500
that's like just the understanding of


401
00:19:38.500 --> 00:19:41.300
taking something that seems good tends to


402
00:19:41.300 --> 00:19:42.900
make a lazy like trying.


403
00:19:43.900 --> 00:19:46.600
Tend to make a lazy person again that's harmonious flow


404
00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:49.300
the ones that conflict once you master


405
00:19:49.300 --> 00:19:52.600
them tend to really Elevate you in like you skip


406
00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:55.600
steps you level up and level up in level up. So I


407
00:19:55.600 --> 00:19:58.100
want you to keep that in mind that nothing's black and white if you've ever


408
00:19:58.100 --> 00:20:01.300
gotten in astrology reading from anyone before and they've given


409
00:20:01.300 --> 00:20:04.500
you Doomsday Prophecy type readings understand that


410
00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:08.400
I don't do that. I think it's important to understand what possibly


411
00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:10.100
could be negative but it's


412
00:20:10.100 --> 00:20:14.100
always in your best interest to have hope to have direction


413
00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:16.200
to have perspective and to be


414
00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:19.400
armed with the ability to take energy and


415
00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:22.600
use it in your direction in your own way so that


416
00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:25.200
it doesn't manifest in its natural


417
00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:28.600
state and I think the lower vibrational is just it's natural state,


418
00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:30.700
but we'll get into that again later.


419
00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:33.700
I'm going to get into.


420
00:20:35.900 --> 00:20:38.100
how to cast a chart I'm just going to start there because I


421
00:20:38.100 --> 00:20:40.500
think that is the best way to start so


422
00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:44.400
I know that this is cut off a little bit because of


423
00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:48.300
my setup my format. But this website is astro.com


424
00:20:47.300 --> 00:20:51.900
astro.com. And


425
00:20:50.900 --> 00:20:53.300
this is a website that


426
00:20:53.300 --> 00:20:56.100
most astrologers use if they're not


427
00:20:56.100 --> 00:20:59.600
using solar fire, which is PC only there's really


428
00:20:59.600 --> 00:20:59.800
no.


429
00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:03.500
Good Mac software. Maybe I'll end


430
00:21:03.500 --> 00:21:06.200
up doing that and and working with the developer and creating one


431
00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:09.600
but honestly, everything's going online. Most


432
00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:12.800
people want to be able to do this from their phone. So I just


433
00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:15.600
got in the habit of using this I use a few sites, but


434
00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:18.100
this is the main one that I use. This is what I'm going to use to teach you.


435
00:21:18.100 --> 00:21:21.000
And if you've been on my live readings I use this for live readings as well.


436
00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:23.500
now when you get into


437
00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:27.900
Into astro.com you're going


438
00:21:27.900 --> 00:21:30.900
to go to horoscopes up at the top. There you


439
00:21:30.900 --> 00:21:33.000
go. You can kind of see it. Sorry. It's cut off a little


440
00:21:33.100 --> 00:21:36.600
bit. And then it's going to bring up this menu for the


441
00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:40.000
purposes of today extended chart selection is


442
00:21:39.100 --> 00:21:42.300
what you want. You're gonna click on that


443
00:21:42.300 --> 00:21:46.100
now for me, everything is already pre-loaded


444
00:21:45.100 --> 00:21:48.000
because I use this and then I


445
00:21:48.100 --> 00:21:51.300
have a drop down with everybody's information, but I'm gonna assume that


446
00:21:51.300 --> 00:21:54.900
you haven't used it before that's your first time. You're gonna click add you're


447
00:21:54.900 --> 00:21:57.200
gonna fill out your information. First name last


448
00:21:57.200 --> 00:22:01.200
name gender female male or events now


449
00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:03.100
event charts again. We're not gonna talk about


450
00:22:03.100 --> 00:22:07.200
this. Now. These are this is called electional astrology. This is


451
00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:10.800
something that I do if you have a business if you want to know like


452
00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:13.400
the town Charter if you want to understand the Pluto


453
00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:16.100
Return of the United States if you


454
00:22:16.100 --> 00:22:18.900
want to see how your marriage might transpire


455
00:22:19.700 --> 00:22:22.200
You would choose event and that would cast an


456
00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:25.400
election chart. It is read a little bit differently, but that's


457
00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:28.200
why that option is there male female is obvious. It really


458
00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:31.600
doesn't make that much of a difference. It's not going to change any


459
00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:34.100
energy if your male or female for me.


460
00:22:34.100 --> 00:22:37.700
I just basically use it. So I remember who I'm talking to when I'm


461
00:22:37.700 --> 00:22:40.900
reading the chart knowing your gender will let


462
00:22:40.900 --> 00:22:41.200
me know.


463
00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:49.300
Sorry, somebody asked me what the site was. It is Astro like


464
00:22:48.300 --> 00:22:52.000
the word for Star astro.com.


465
00:22:56.700 --> 00:22:59.400
So while you're doing this, I know that men


466
00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:00.400
tend to


467
00:23:01.500 --> 00:23:04.500
less now than than ever but tend to


468
00:23:04.500 --> 00:23:07.800
gravitate towards their Mars placement women tend


469
00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:10.000
to gravitate towards their Venus placement. And that's


470
00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:13.500
more of an advanced technique that I'm not going to get into right now, but that's


471
00:23:13.500 --> 00:23:16.800
what that's for birthday. Pretty obvious date


472
00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:19.300
month year hour. You're gonna want


473
00:23:19.300 --> 00:23:22.300
to know if it's AM or PM.


474
00:23:22.300 --> 00:23:25.400
Like I said, the time is the most important part if


475
00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:28.200
you have your date and you have your place, but you don't have


476
00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:28.600
your time.


477
00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:32.200
Birth time rectification if you cannot get it from


478
00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:34.900
a parent or legal Source like your birth certificate.


479
00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:39.100
Part-time rectification is a service that


480
00:23:38.100 --> 00:23:41.800
we basically use the events


481
00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:44.900
in your life in your relationships with people to determine


482
00:23:44.900 --> 00:23:47.100
even your physical characteristics, which I'll get into


483
00:23:47.100 --> 00:23:50.100
to determine what time you were born. If you know it


484
00:23:50.100 --> 00:23:54.600
you just choose here what it is enter that in country birthplace.


485
00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:56.200
You just type in whatever you're gonna


486
00:23:56.200 --> 00:23:59.100
type these settings we will


487
00:23:59.100 --> 00:23:59.300
do.


488
00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:03.600
Yeah, you don't need these right now and then you hit continue. I'm


489
00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:05.400
just going to go back because I'm already preloaded.


490
00:24:05.900 --> 00:24:09.000
We go down here. We're only going to worry about round special


491
00:24:08.700 --> 00:24:11.300
ephemeris, and you can't see it over there, but it says


492
00:24:11.300 --> 00:24:14.100
Poland we're not going to worry about


493
00:24:14.100 --> 00:24:17.700
those right now. Just this the chart type for this there


494
00:24:17.700 --> 00:24:19.900
are so many things that we can do in astrology.


495
00:24:20.700 --> 00:24:23.600
We're not getting into any of this in this class except for


496
00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:26.600
a natal chart wheel. This is your birth chart natal


497
00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:29.300
chart birth chart. Those are interchangeable terms for the same


498
00:24:29.300 --> 00:24:29.600
thing.


499
00:24:31.300 --> 00:24:34.300
Deep chart drawing style for me


500
00:24:34.300 --> 00:24:37.200
is web default. I've changed some


501
00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:40.800
things and this is kind of like the web default. There's no


502
00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:42.900
reason to go into any of these others.


503
00:24:45.300 --> 00:24:48.600
Hellenistic astrology when I was telling you I don't use other astrology.


504
00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:49.300
This is one of them.


505
00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:54.400
I'm gonna get into that in a moment, but just keep it as web default


506
00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:57.100
start date. This is you just leave us, you know,


507
00:24:57.100 --> 00:25:00.100
normal leave it as today's date that way if you end up doing transits again,


508
00:25:00.100 --> 00:25:01.400
we'll talk about that in another class.


509
00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:05.400
Then you'll know what date you can move back in time. You can move forward in


510
00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:07.700
time so that you can analyze life at different periods.


511
00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:13.700
For the record because this is important and ephemeris


512
00:25:13.700 --> 00:25:17.000
is the mathematical chart.


513
00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:18.600
Basically, they're not chart.


514
00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:22.400
I guess it's a table. It's the


515
00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:25.900
mathematical table of where every planetary


516
00:25:25.900 --> 00:25:28.600
position is going to be at its exact degree when


517
00:25:28.600 --> 00:25:31.300
it goes retrograde when it goes forward when you look at it. It is


518
00:25:31.300 --> 00:25:34.000
extremely mathematical. It looks like a math chart from high school.


519
00:25:34.200 --> 00:25:37.700
That is what is the backbone of astrology and


520
00:25:37.700 --> 00:25:40.700
it's used in creating the the chart


521
00:25:40.700 --> 00:25:40.900
here.


522
00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:45.400
Health System when we get down here before I


523
00:25:45.400 --> 00:25:48.600
even go into health system over here, you'll see draconics sidereal and


524
00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:51.300
tropical tropical is another word


525
00:25:51.300 --> 00:25:55.000
for Western So you you're learning tropical Western


526
00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:55.600
astrology.


527
00:25:56.500 --> 00:25:59.400
Tropical is what we do. If you've heard of vatic astrology


528
00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:02.100
which to me doesn't resonate but a lot


529
00:26:02.100 --> 00:26:05.500
of people swear by it. It's a completely different system


530
00:26:05.500 --> 00:26:09.400
sidereal astrology uses planets as


531
00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:11.700
an astronomer would use the planets.


532
00:26:12.300 --> 00:26:13.400
And they are calculated.


533
00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:19.800
by by taking into account the the


534
00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:21.500
processions and


535
00:26:23.700 --> 00:26:26.600
the reason why I don't think it works or I


536
00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:29.000
haven't seen it work accurately when I say accurately I'm not


537
00:26:29.300 --> 00:26:32.100
talking about I get a reading some of it's right some of its wrong. I'm


538
00:26:32.100 --> 00:26:36.300
talking about every single thing. Every single detail is right. I


539
00:26:35.300 --> 00:26:37.300
have not seen that ever.


540
00:26:38.100 --> 00:26:41.300
The reason why I don't think it's right is that tropical uses the


541
00:26:41.300 --> 00:26:44.600
planets as they relate to the vernal equinox meaning


542
00:26:44.600 --> 00:26:47.300
they line up with the seasons based on the earth, which


543
00:26:47.300 --> 00:26:48.900
is the planet you're physically on.


544
00:26:49.900 --> 00:26:53.100
Those seasons are Cycles astrology


545
00:26:52.100 --> 00:26:55.300
is all about Cycles. You can look at your own life


546
00:26:55.300 --> 00:26:58.500
and you can point out all the different things that seem


547
00:26:58.500 --> 00:27:01.600
to recur throughout your life these themes these Cycles these


548
00:27:01.600 --> 00:27:04.300
whether good or bad like I've even pointed


549
00:27:04.300 --> 00:27:07.500
out in my own life. I know two specific points of


550
00:27:07.500 --> 00:27:10.700
the Year where one of them is very specific change.


551
00:27:10.700 --> 00:27:13.100
Sometimes it's really bad. Sometimes it's


552
00:27:13.100 --> 00:27:16.400
really good. It always leads me to the Future.


553
00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:20.700
But during it it can be very difficult for me. And


554
00:27:20.700 --> 00:27:23.900
then I've noticed another point in in the


555
00:27:23.900 --> 00:27:26.200
year almost every single year that is


556
00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:29.200
extremely positive. It's like New Beginnings. It's always New


557
00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:33.300
Beginnings for me and actually lines up with the the vernal


558
00:27:32.300 --> 00:27:35.100
equinox, but it's not like that for


559
00:27:35.100 --> 00:27:38.600
everybody. We all have different times. We all have a different cycle and


560
00:27:38.600 --> 00:27:39.400
set a cycles for everything.


561
00:27:40.300 --> 00:27:41.600
But that's tropical astrology.


562
00:27:42.600 --> 00:27:45.400
It has to do with your position


563
00:27:45.400 --> 00:27:48.800
on the planet when you move it changes or


564
00:27:48.800 --> 00:27:51.700
I shouldn't say changes your natal chart never changes. But as


565
00:27:51.700 --> 00:27:54.200
you move, you actually get a new natal chart


566
00:27:54.200 --> 00:27:57.400
based on your geocentric position. So if you are born


567
00:27:57.400 --> 00:28:00.300
on the East Coast like I was and when I moved to Los Angeles


568
00:28:00.300 --> 00:28:03.600
on the other side of the country, it was a different chart


569
00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:07.300
meaning. I had a different life. My health was different my underlying


570
00:28:06.300 --> 00:28:09.400
tone stayed the same because the natal charts


571
00:28:09.400 --> 00:28:12.600
still there, but my job changed my career path


572
00:28:12.600 --> 00:28:15.400
the way my emotions were everything.


573
00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:19.500
And that's important relocation astrology is going


574
00:28:19.500 --> 00:28:21.900
to be a different probably a different course that I teach.


575
00:28:23.800 --> 00:28:26.400
draconic is something I don't know that I subscribe to I'm


576
00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:27.800
still testing this out, but


577
00:28:28.600 --> 00:28:31.400
it's interesting. What it does is it sets the North Node


578
00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:32.600
to zero Aries?


579
00:28:33.100 --> 00:28:36.300
and it's supposed to be your life purpose your


580
00:28:36.300 --> 00:28:40.000
life Journey on a very soul level meaning what your


581
00:28:39.700 --> 00:28:43.200
soul wanted out of this world if the


582
00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:45.200
real world didn't exist, and it's a very


583
00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:45.700
kind of


584
00:28:46.900 --> 00:28:48.600
esoteric theme it's a very


585
00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:54.000
it's a bit far removed from you know, the Practical so


586
00:28:53.100 --> 00:28:56.300
it's something I'm like I'm looking into I don't know that


587
00:28:56.300 --> 00:28:59.900
I subscribe to it. But that's what it is. Again. Geocentric means


588
00:28:59.900 --> 00:29:02.200
earth-based heliocentric would be sun-based we


589
00:29:02.200 --> 00:29:04.800
use geocentric none of this matters.


590
00:29:05.400 --> 00:29:07.700
Health Science our health systems rather


591
00:29:08.500 --> 00:29:11.600
there are a lot of house systems house systems


592
00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:15.200
are the way that we calculate where the beginning


593
00:29:14.200 --> 00:29:17.700
of one area of life in in


594
00:29:17.700 --> 00:29:19.300
your life starts and where it ends.


595
00:29:20.200 --> 00:29:23.600
Each one is is based differently. Some are called quadrant


596
00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:27.600
systems. Some are called time-based systems. It's just


597
00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:30.100
different calculations again. I'm not going to get into the boring details. You


598
00:29:30.100 --> 00:29:33.300
can Google any of this and if anyone's actually


599
00:29:33.300 --> 00:29:36.100
interested, I'll do classes that hone in on this but I don't want


600
00:29:36.100 --> 00:29:39.800
to waste your time on this. I want to get to the good stuff. I learned on


601
00:29:39.800 --> 00:29:42.300
placidus if you click default. It


602
00:29:42.300 --> 00:29:43.700
will also be placidus.


603
00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:46.000
You can't see that sorry.


604
00:29:46.800 --> 00:29:47.000
here


605
00:29:47.800 --> 00:29:51.400
There you go. If you click default, it will also be placidus. I


606
00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:53.400
don't like plasticist. It doesn't work. It


607
00:29:53.400 --> 00:29:56.500
doesn't resonate and it took me a long time. It took me about two


608
00:29:56.500 --> 00:29:59.400
years of working with astrology and


609
00:29:59.400 --> 00:30:03.200
learning to figure out that the reason my


610
00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:05.700
my readings were not


611
00:30:05.700 --> 00:30:08.900
accurate came down to the fact that I was using classicist


612
00:30:08.900 --> 00:30:10.300
house system and


613
00:30:11.400 --> 00:30:15.700
The irony is that it's extremely complicated


614
00:30:14.700 --> 00:30:17.700
in certain areas. Meaning they


615
00:30:17.700 --> 00:30:20.100
have things like and I'm actually just going to


616
00:30:20.100 --> 00:30:21.000
show you this now.


617
00:30:22.100 --> 00:30:24.300
I'm going to pull it up because and then I'm gonna continue back.


618
00:30:25.100 --> 00:30:27.600
So if I pull up placidus house system.


619
00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:30.600
And I pull out whole signs, which is what I use.


620
00:30:33.800 --> 00:30:36.500
You see that they're very different whole signs


621
00:30:36.500 --> 00:30:40.000
lines up with the beginning of each sign. So the


622
00:30:39.600 --> 00:30:42.400
sign is it just shifts. It's very clean.


623
00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:45.400
It's very easy. This is the oldest chart system. This


624
00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:48.700
is the oldest house system. This is what the babylonius used


625
00:30:48.700 --> 00:30:51.400
for a very very very long time and all


626
00:30:51.400 --> 00:30:54.300
of these ones are newer Placid. This is actually one of


627
00:30:54.300 --> 00:30:57.700
the newest ones it was developed by Ptolemy


628
00:30:57.700 --> 00:31:00.300
and told me has another system and then


629
00:31:00.300 --> 00:31:03.100
it was modified and it's time-based and it's supposed to


630
00:31:03.100 --> 00:31:06.100
make up for the curvature of the earth. It's supposed to


631
00:31:06.900 --> 00:31:09.500
Solve problems but it I it ironically


632
00:31:09.500 --> 00:31:12.600
ends up creating more problems. So you see that the ascendant here


633
00:31:12.600 --> 00:31:15.500
is actually the beginning of the first house and


634
00:31:15.500 --> 00:31:18.400
you see that every house is a different size.


635
00:31:19.400 --> 00:31:22.400
Now I'm going to show you what happens if we


636
00:31:22.400 --> 00:31:24.000
were just to take you know.


637
00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:27.500
Rosy gardener


638
00:31:28.800 --> 00:31:31.700
and she's a female and she was born on the


639
00:31:31.700 --> 00:31:36.000
21st of December 1991.


640
00:31:36.700 --> 00:31:39.700
And then she was born at 5 am just make


641
00:31:39.700 --> 00:31:42.400
it easy and she was in Anchorage. Can


642
00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:43.300
I spell Anchorage?


643
00:31:44.400 --> 00:31:47.800
Yes, Anchorage, Alaska and when


644
00:31:47.800 --> 00:31:48.800
I pull up her chart.


645
00:31:49.800 --> 00:31:52.200
This actually isn't as bad as some that I've seen but you notice


646
00:31:52.200 --> 00:31:56.000
how this twelfth house and sixth house axis is so


647
00:31:55.600 --> 00:31:59.100
small the fifth


648
00:31:58.100 --> 00:32:01.400
house 11th is pretty small and then the third


649
00:32:01.400 --> 00:32:03.700
and the ninth are huge.


650
00:32:04.800 --> 00:32:07.200
I'm going to do the same thing and I'm going


651
00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:07.600
to use.


652
00:32:09.800 --> 00:32:11.800
I'm gonna guess because


653
00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:19.000
Actually, here's what I'm going to do while you guys are sitting here. I'm gonna let


654
00:32:19.100 --> 00:32:22.200
you see that I don't want to know my geography like I should.


655
00:32:23.300 --> 00:32:26.400
I can't think of the most southern tip. It's not buenosairs.


656
00:32:27.100 --> 00:32:28.200
What's a big city down here?


657
00:32:30.500 --> 00:32:31.900
Rio Gallegos


658
00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:34.300
So let's do Rio.


659
00:32:35.400 --> 00:32:37.600
Okay jagos, I can't spell.


660
00:32:38.900 --> 00:32:40.500
There we go, Argentina.


661
00:32:41.400 --> 00:32:44.100
And when you start doing these they'll all change but you see how some of


662
00:32:44.100 --> 00:32:47.300
these houses get really tiny. And then this one's huge


663
00:32:47.300 --> 00:32:51.500
this one encompasses three signs. Sorry, one two,


664
00:32:50.500 --> 00:32:53.700
three now the


665
00:32:53.700 --> 00:32:56.800
idea of placidus house system is that


666
00:32:57.900 --> 00:33:00.500
The twelfth house is a very large house


667
00:33:00.500 --> 00:33:03.200
the six houses very large house. Meaning there's more


668
00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:05.000
emphasis on these areas of life.


669
00:33:05.800 --> 00:33:08.900
Taurus and Scorpio are intercepted


670
00:33:09.700 --> 00:33:12.900
meaning they they don't


671
00:33:12.900 --> 00:33:15.400
have a house. They don't belong to any area of


672
00:33:15.400 --> 00:33:18.200
life and they're swallowed up in the sixth and Twelfth houses.


673
00:33:19.500 --> 00:33:20.500
counter respectively


674
00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:24.400
these two this this is always a


675
00:33:24.400 --> 00:33:27.400
source of contention because people believe that placidus being


676
00:33:27.400 --> 00:33:30.600
so complicated and having to deal with interceptions and


677
00:33:30.600 --> 00:33:33.800
what this really means and then finding, you know, Venus Venus


678
00:33:33.800 --> 00:33:35.100
is in another intercepted house.


679
00:33:35.900 --> 00:33:38.400
That this is like because it's


680
00:33:38.400 --> 00:33:41.100
more complicated somehow. It's more accurate. It's not.


681
00:33:42.300 --> 00:33:45.300
When you look at that was an extreme, but


682
00:33:45.300 --> 00:33:49.100
when you look at my chart, this is whole signs. This is placidus.


683
00:33:49.800 --> 00:33:52.300
You see and by the way when you're talking


684
00:33:52.300 --> 00:33:55.800
about transits which are the planets as they move over a


685
00:33:55.800 --> 00:33:58.200
house when your plan when your house is


686
00:33:58.200 --> 00:34:01.700
this small the moon would move over in half a day. Meaning you


687
00:34:01.700 --> 00:34:04.300
would almost never experience anything in that area of


688
00:34:04.300 --> 00:34:07.700
life. It would take almost a week in that


689
00:34:07.700 --> 00:34:10.300
last chart to go over the sixth and 12th


690
00:34:10.300 --> 00:34:14.100
house because you're talking about yeah take about a week because it's


691
00:34:13.100 --> 00:34:16.300
two and a half two to two and a half days per sign for


692
00:34:16.300 --> 00:34:19.700
the moon to Transit. So you're talking about a week in one.


693
00:34:19.700 --> 00:34:22.600
It's different energies, but one area of life being impacted. Now


694
00:34:22.600 --> 00:34:25.300
it never ever plays out that


695
00:34:25.300 --> 00:34:28.300
way. The Moon is never impacting that area of life for that


696
00:34:28.300 --> 00:34:31.300
long. That's another reason why plaster this but you go too high


697
00:34:31.300 --> 00:34:34.400
too low and go to the wrong places on the planet and the chart


698
00:34:34.400 --> 00:34:37.200
just completely falls apart for those reasons and you


699
00:34:37.200 --> 00:34:37.500
see here


700
00:34:38.600 --> 00:34:41.600
My mercury in placidus is in the tenth house.


701
00:34:41.600 --> 00:34:44.300
That would be public speaking now. It is


702
00:34:44.300 --> 00:34:47.700
the ruler of my 11th house. So this one's a bad example here


703
00:34:47.700 --> 00:34:50.300
in whole science. It's in my 11th house.


704
00:34:51.200 --> 00:34:54.500
And again, you're gonna learn what houses are Jupiter and plastis


705
00:34:54.500 --> 00:34:58.100
in my third house. It's in my fourth house here and


706
00:34:57.100 --> 00:35:01.000
Uranus as well. Uranus is probably the


707
00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:03.300
best example for me


708
00:35:03.300 --> 00:35:06.100
to understand why things are not playing out the way


709
00:35:06.100 --> 00:35:09.600
they are there are charts that are so much better equipped.


710
00:35:10.600 --> 00:35:13.400
Then mine to explain and all my lives. I


711
00:35:13.400 --> 00:35:16.200
have shown people what happens when you're in


712
00:35:16.200 --> 00:35:20.400
the wrong system and how that would play out. And when I


713
00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:23.000
get those charts that come up in those people who are


714
00:35:23.300 --> 00:35:26.300
asking for readings. It makes it a lot easier for me to say


715
00:35:26.300 --> 00:35:29.200
this is what would happen. This is how it isn't whole science. This is


716
00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:32.600
how it is in placidus Placid is just never yields results.


717
00:35:32.600 --> 00:35:35.400
A lot of you guys who have gotten chart readings


718
00:35:35.400 --> 00:35:38.800
from pretty much any astrologer almost all astrologers


719
00:35:38.800 --> 00:35:41.300
use plastidis health system because it's the


720
00:35:41.300 --> 00:35:44.600
default. Like I said, I learned on it too because it's the default everyone says


721
00:35:44.600 --> 00:35:47.900
to use it but it wasn't actually created until


722
00:35:47.900 --> 00:35:50.300
the 16th century. It's like one


723
00:35:50.300 --> 00:35:54.200
of the newest ones and then in the 17th century astrology was


724
00:35:54.200 --> 00:35:55.700
removed from the mainstream.


725
00:35:56.400 --> 00:35:59.100
So you have to wonder why was placidus created in


726
00:35:59.100 --> 00:36:01.800
the first place if it was there for less than a century.


727
00:36:02.600 --> 00:36:05.400
Less than a hundred years something was up with


728
00:36:05.400 --> 00:36:08.300
that. Something doesn't make sense. And I believe it was created the


729
00:36:08.300 --> 00:36:11.200
to throw everybody off because the people in power


730
00:36:11.200 --> 00:36:14.600
would not want you to understand this and funny


731
00:36:14.600 --> 00:36:17.800
enough hidden within everything is the one that actually yields results.


732
00:36:17.800 --> 00:36:20.500
If you guys have seen my lives if you've seen my readings gotten


733
00:36:20.500 --> 00:36:23.900
readings from me, you know, how accurate whole science is equal house


734
00:36:23.900 --> 00:36:26.200
is another one that's pretty popular. I'm just gonna show you


735
00:36:26.200 --> 00:36:29.400
what happens with equal equal house system basically takes


736
00:36:29.400 --> 00:36:32.500
the ascendant puts it at your the start


737
00:36:32.500 --> 00:36:35.400
of your first house and then every house from


738
00:36:35.400 --> 00:36:38.700
there is based off of the degree that


739
00:36:38.700 --> 00:36:41.100
the ascendant is my Ascend is at 13


740
00:36:41.100 --> 00:36:44.600
degrees. So the second house is at 13 degrees Virgo third


741
00:36:44.600 --> 00:36:48.600
house is 13 degrees Libra. So and so forth this in


742
00:36:47.600 --> 00:36:49.100
my chart,


743
00:36:50.200 --> 00:36:53.600
is very obvious that it does not apply Mars in


744
00:36:53.600 --> 00:36:53.600
the


745
00:36:55.600 --> 00:36:58.300
second house. And again, you're going to learn what this


746
00:36:58.300 --> 00:37:01.600
means being action and drive towards


747
00:37:01.600 --> 00:37:04.500
my value and finance outside of


748
00:37:04.500 --> 00:37:08.400
the orb of influence for to spill into my third house. This


749
00:37:07.400 --> 00:37:10.200
does not play that way up until


750
00:37:10.200 --> 00:37:13.500
I was 20 to 21 years old. I had no drive


751
00:37:13.500 --> 00:37:16.400
for money. I had no drive for Value. I had none of that. I wasn't trying


752
00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:19.500
to really do much that wasn't like fun or


753
00:37:19.500 --> 00:37:22.100
just something I wanted to do when I


754
00:37:22.100 --> 00:37:25.700
turned 21 and you'll learn this again in another class. I


755
00:37:25.700 --> 00:37:28.300
hit my progressed Virgo, so I went from


756
00:37:28.300 --> 00:37:29.100
a Leo Rising.


757
00:37:29.900 --> 00:37:32.600
To a Virgo Rising the Mars


758
00:37:32.600 --> 00:37:35.400
then moved from my third house into my second house. And then yeah, I


759
00:37:35.400 --> 00:37:38.200
was all about making money and whatnot, but prior to that


760
00:37:38.200 --> 00:37:38.400
no.


761
00:37:39.600 --> 00:37:39.700
so


762
00:37:41.200 --> 00:37:44.200
I'm not gonna go through all these whole science health system is the one you


763
00:37:44.200 --> 00:37:47.600
choose when you come down here for the sake of this class.


764
00:37:47.600 --> 00:37:50.500
We are only going to keep true node and


765
00:37:50.500 --> 00:37:52.400
descending node. This is north and south node.


766
00:37:53.200 --> 00:37:56.200
And traditional deckons really I'm not gonna go into deckons. I just like


767
00:37:56.200 --> 00:37:59.000
to see them there. Otherwise, I feel like something's missing in the chart.


768
00:37:59.800 --> 00:38:02.100
In another class. I'm going to talk about deccans.


769
00:38:03.400 --> 00:38:06.200
They basically just give you extra information, but they're not important for


770
00:38:06.200 --> 00:38:06.600
this class.


771
00:38:07.400 --> 00:38:10.200
In aspects, we're not going to worry about anything because we're not talking about


772
00:38:10.200 --> 00:38:13.300
aspects when we come down here. There are


773
00:38:13.300 --> 00:38:14.200
a lot of things that we can choose.


774
00:38:15.100 --> 00:38:16.600
I am only going to choose.


775
00:38:18.200 --> 00:38:18.800
Chiron


776
00:38:19.400 --> 00:38:22.500
and I'm briefly gonna touch on Chiron. I'm not going to go into


777
00:38:22.500 --> 00:38:25.200
it. After that. We we don't need to worry about the


778
00:38:25.200 --> 00:38:28.600
reference place because we're not doing relocation astrology or solar chart


779
00:38:28.600 --> 00:38:31.200
solar return chart or anything like that again for another


780
00:38:31.200 --> 00:38:34.400
time. Yay. We've moved in we have


781
00:38:34.400 --> 00:38:37.200
clicked it and now we have our chart you always want


782
00:38:37.200 --> 00:38:40.200
to verify if you're reading for yourself if you're reading for anyone else


783
00:38:40.200 --> 00:38:43.400
you want to verify that you enter the information and correctly. Otherwise, you're


784
00:38:43.400 --> 00:38:46.600
gonna spend a lot of time reading the wrong thing and


785
00:38:46.600 --> 00:38:49.100
then you're gonna have to start over wipe the


786
00:38:49.100 --> 00:38:51.200
Slate clean and and redo everything.


787
00:38:52.400 --> 00:38:55.200
So this is the chart I am now going to


788
00:38:55.200 --> 00:38:58.600
get into it because this is what is important. Now, you know how to cast a


789
00:38:58.600 --> 00:39:01.200
sharp a chart through astro.com. This is what you


790
00:39:01.200 --> 00:39:04.700
have. And what we're going to do is I'm going to switch over


791
00:39:04.700 --> 00:39:07.400
to my stuff. I created like two


792
00:39:07.400 --> 00:39:10.900
minutes before I started this class and we're


793
00:39:10.900 --> 00:39:11.900
gonna talk about this so


794
00:39:13.200 --> 00:39:16.500
Over here is the first house. So the


795
00:39:16.500 --> 00:39:19.100
first house is ruled by Aries. It is


796
00:39:19.100 --> 00:39:20.400
the house of self.


797
00:39:21.500 --> 00:39:24.400
It is ruled. It is a there's the


798
00:39:24.400 --> 00:39:27.900
symbol for Aries, which will I'll show you again in a


799
00:39:27.900 --> 00:39:30.400
moment. This is ruled by Mars and


800
00:39:30.400 --> 00:39:33.600
you can see it's the first house. I probably should have went the other way around first


801
00:39:33.600 --> 00:39:36.400
house ruled by Mars Mars. Rules Aries. It's


802
00:39:36.400 --> 00:39:39.000
the house of self and there's areas against spelled out.


803
00:39:39.600 --> 00:39:39.900
this


804
00:39:41.600 --> 00:39:44.400
this area of life is also where the ascendant is


805
00:39:44.400 --> 00:39:47.200
contained and I'm going to get to angles after I go through


806
00:39:47.200 --> 00:39:50.000
all 12 houses here and all 12 signs. I want you


807
00:39:50.100 --> 00:39:53.500
to understand that also rulership is extremely important.


808
00:39:53.500 --> 00:39:55.500
So when someone talks about rulership,


809
00:39:56.300 --> 00:39:59.000
What they're saying is what is the planet?


810
00:39:59.800 --> 00:40:02.400
It could be the sign sometimes we're talking about the sign but usually


811
00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:05.200
they're talking about the planet. What is the planet


812
00:40:05.200 --> 00:40:08.200
that rules a specific area of your life? These are


813
00:40:08.200 --> 00:40:12.000
the 12 houses. Everybody has all 12 signs. Everybody


814
00:40:11.300 --> 00:40:14.500
has all nine planets and then some


815
00:40:14.500 --> 00:40:17.800
everybody has all of this right? It's


816
00:40:17.800 --> 00:40:20.300
always affecting. So if you've ever heard somebody say,


817
00:40:20.300 --> 00:40:24.500
I don't like Leos or I can't stand Sagittarius.


818
00:40:23.500 --> 00:40:26.200
They're really saying there's a


819
00:40:26.200 --> 00:40:27.500
part of me. I don't like


820
00:40:28.600 --> 00:40:31.300
and it's funny because when I


821
00:40:31.300 --> 00:40:34.600
got into astrology remember I said I had the wrong birth time. I


822
00:40:34.600 --> 00:40:36.500
thought I was a double Gemini Aquarius.


823
00:40:37.400 --> 00:40:40.700
So I thought because the hour


824
00:40:40.700 --> 00:40:43.100
the time was off by like four hours. I think


825
00:40:43.100 --> 00:40:46.100
I thought I was my ascendant was here.


826
00:40:46.100 --> 00:40:49.500
I thought I was a Gemini rising a Gemini sun and


827
00:40:49.500 --> 00:40:52.300
an aquarius Moon and I was like a rat


828
00:40:52.300 --> 00:40:54.500
when I was younger. I was a musician.


829
00:40:55.400 --> 00:40:59.000
I was a singer a rapper a dancer. I


830
00:40:58.100 --> 00:41:01.400
did the whole thing and you can see that my


831
00:41:01.400 --> 00:41:03.300
10th house is in Taurus will get into that.


832
00:41:04.500 --> 00:41:05.800
I did the whole thing and


833
00:41:08.400 --> 00:41:11.100
Then I found out and my mother who I


834
00:41:11.100 --> 00:41:14.800
had quite an interesting relationship with my my birth


835
00:41:14.800 --> 00:41:17.100
mother and My adoptive mother and my foster.


836
00:41:19.700 --> 00:41:22.500
My adoptive mother is a Leo son


837
00:41:22.500 --> 00:41:26.200
and at the time getting into astrology I thought Sun


838
00:41:25.200 --> 00:41:28.200
Signs were the most important thing I didn't


839
00:41:28.200 --> 00:41:31.400
find out until later that your ascendant sign is the most important


840
00:41:31.400 --> 00:41:34.600
followed by the moon followed by the Sun the


841
00:41:34.600 --> 00:41:35.600
sun's actually number three


842
00:41:36.300 --> 00:41:39.300
and then there's an argument to be made for the IC angle as


843
00:41:39.300 --> 00:41:39.400
well.


844
00:41:41.900 --> 00:41:44.800
So I thought I was Gemini and my mother


845
00:41:44.800 --> 00:41:47.200
was a Leo son. I was like ha. I'm


846
00:41:47.200 --> 00:41:51.000
glad I'm I don't have any Leo in my chart because it's


847
00:41:50.200 --> 00:41:52.300
you know, it was an empty house.


848
00:41:53.300 --> 00:41:56.300
And then I found the right birth time and I found out man. I'm


849
00:41:56.300 --> 00:42:00.000
gonna I'm a Leo ascendant. Are you kidding me? I hate Leos


850
00:41:59.800 --> 00:42:02.200
and it's because I have a


851
00:42:02.200 --> 00:42:05.600
lot of self-esteem issues. They were much worse as a child and I


852
00:42:05.600 --> 00:42:08.600
didn't like me. I didn't like everything I


853
00:42:08.600 --> 00:42:12.000
was and could be and it was all exemplified through


854
00:42:11.100 --> 00:42:14.200
the sun sign of my mother and this


855
00:42:14.200 --> 00:42:17.100
happens a lot when people are like I don't like a sign. I don't like this. I


856
00:42:17.100 --> 00:42:20.100
don't like that. It's actually because there's a light especially when it's a


857
00:42:20.100 --> 00:42:23.600
sun sign. It's a light being shined shown shine


858
00:42:23.600 --> 00:42:26.100
whatever the word is it's being cast upon you.


859
00:42:27.200 --> 00:42:30.000
And it's highlighting the things you don't like about yourself.


860
00:42:30.900 --> 00:42:33.500
And when you come to grips with what with


861
00:42:33.500 --> 00:42:36.200
what those things are you have an amazing


862
00:42:36.200 --> 00:42:38.100
relationship. I'll give you a for instance.


863
00:42:39.100 --> 00:42:42.100
Pisces energy. I don't have anything here. We'll talk about


864
00:42:42.100 --> 00:42:45.100
rulerships later. But when someone's son sits in


865
00:42:45.100 --> 00:42:48.700
Pisces when I was younger, it used to bug me Pisces or


866
00:42:48.700 --> 00:42:51.100
two emotional. I have a moon in aquarius. So


867
00:42:51.100 --> 00:42:54.400
I don't like emotion to emotional to this to that


868
00:42:54.400 --> 00:42:57.200
too like out there. I'm also Gemini right


869
00:42:57.200 --> 00:43:00.900
Gemini's logical. So it's a square again. We'll get into aspects later.


870
00:43:00.900 --> 00:43:04.500
But the point of that is Pisces


871
00:43:03.500 --> 00:43:06.700
energy is something I had to bring into


872
00:43:06.700 --> 00:43:09.300
my life. And of course, of course the universe


873
00:43:09.300 --> 00:43:12.600
when I was ready gave me a Pisces wife


874
00:43:12.600 --> 00:43:16.200
and a Pisces daughter. So, you


875
00:43:15.200 --> 00:43:18.100
know, the universe has a sense of humor as well.


876
00:43:19.700 --> 00:43:22.300
So that's what's important there now.


877
00:43:23.100 --> 00:43:26.900
The ascendant sits within the first house here. Now.


878
00:43:26.900 --> 00:43:29.300
The first house here is ruled by


879
00:43:29.300 --> 00:43:30.500
Aries. Excuse me.


880
00:43:32.100 --> 00:43:35.500
Aries here is a cardinal sign you're gonna


881
00:43:35.500 --> 00:43:38.500
see when I go through the houses and signs that


882
00:43:38.500 --> 00:43:41.700
there are three types of modalities, which


883
00:43:41.700 --> 00:43:44.100
is what this first word is and there are four types


884
00:43:44.100 --> 00:43:47.200
of elements and I color coded them just to make them a bit


885
00:43:47.200 --> 00:43:50.200
easier when I made this five minutes before I started this


886
00:43:51.200 --> 00:43:55.000
Your Cardinal sign cardinal signs are at the


887
00:43:55.500 --> 00:43:58.400
angles. So when I start talking about the angles, which are


888
00:43:58.400 --> 00:44:01.700
the ascendant descendant icmc you


889
00:44:01.700 --> 00:44:04.700
don't have to worry about that right now. I'm gonna get back to it the ascendants in


890
00:44:04.700 --> 00:44:07.600
your first house it is where your season


891
00:44:07.600 --> 00:44:10.100
start it lines up with the months and the months line


892
00:44:10.100 --> 00:44:10.800
up at the seasons.


893
00:44:11.800 --> 00:44:14.600
And they create the cycles of the earth meaning Aries.


894
00:44:15.300 --> 00:44:17.600
Which is the sign we're here. We're at here.


895
00:44:18.500 --> 00:44:21.700
Is the beginning of a new cycle? It's the baby. It's


896
00:44:21.700 --> 00:44:24.400
always the start in Tarot. It is kind


897
00:44:24.400 --> 00:44:27.300
it doesn't represent but it's kind of like the full card. You're just


898
00:44:27.300 --> 00:44:30.300
getting started Aries is the baby a lot


899
00:44:30.300 --> 00:44:33.100
of the things that Aries embodies, especially at a low


900
00:44:33.100 --> 00:44:35.100
vibration are very immature.


901
00:44:36.100 --> 00:44:39.400
So it moves around that way Pisces being


902
00:44:39.400 --> 00:44:42.200
the last one is actually completion Pisces and I'll get


903
00:44:42.200 --> 00:44:44.900
to this in a minute rules your connection to God.


904
00:44:45.600 --> 00:44:48.200
Because that's the last one. That's the last step and


905
00:44:48.200 --> 00:44:51.400
that's why we're all here is to live the best life. We can while connecting


906
00:44:51.400 --> 00:44:54.300
to God. That's the cycle of completion you


907
00:44:54.300 --> 00:44:55.800
want to do that for each phase of your life.


908
00:44:57.100 --> 00:44:59.900
So Aries here rules the first house.


909
00:45:01.300 --> 00:45:04.400
As I showed before it is the natural ruler there some


910
00:45:04.400 --> 00:45:07.900
astrologers out there say that natural rulers. Do not exist. I


911
00:45:07.900 --> 00:45:10.500
disagree those same


912
00:45:10.500 --> 00:45:12.000
people say that dignity.


913
00:45:12.700 --> 00:45:15.400
Planetary dignity meaning a planet has


914
00:45:15.400 --> 00:45:18.300
a strength it's better in a certain house versus another


915
00:45:18.300 --> 00:45:21.200
I disagree with that. I don't think a planet


916
00:45:21.200 --> 00:45:24.300
is better or worse in any sign or house. I just think you understand


917
00:45:24.300 --> 00:45:27.600
the energies and you can do amazing things. It doesn't


918
00:45:27.600 --> 00:45:28.400
act natural.


919
00:45:29.300 --> 00:45:30.700
Like for instance me.


920
00:45:31.700 --> 00:45:32.000
Sorry.


921
00:45:33.100 --> 00:45:34.900
me here with my


922
00:45:38.200 --> 00:45:41.600
with my word to go Mars in Libra. It


923
00:45:41.600 --> 00:45:42.600
doesn't act natural, but


924
00:45:43.700 --> 00:45:46.300
That's okay. We need those people. We need the people


925
00:45:46.300 --> 00:45:50.700
who who have that that energy


926
00:45:49.700 --> 00:45:53.000
that is not just aggression. You


927
00:45:52.300 --> 00:45:56.100
know that standard Martian energy


928
00:45:55.100 --> 00:45:56.400
there.


929
00:45:57.500 --> 00:46:00.300
That's what we need in this world. We need variety. I


930
00:46:00.300 --> 00:46:03.600
think I think we're at a place where most of us realize that


931
00:46:03.600 --> 00:46:06.100
variety is the spice of life, but it's


932
00:46:06.100 --> 00:46:07.700
also how we move forward.


933
00:46:08.900 --> 00:46:11.700
So Aries is a cardinal meaning Aries energy


934
00:46:11.700 --> 00:46:14.300
is the start. They're very good at getting


935
00:46:14.300 --> 00:46:17.200
things going and as the first the also the ruler of the first


936
00:46:17.200 --> 00:46:20.100
house. It's literally how you start. So when you're talking about


937
00:46:20.100 --> 00:46:23.200
areas energy. It is the foundation and I'm not


938
00:46:23.200 --> 00:46:26.600
talking about fan foundation in terms of like structure or base,


939
00:46:26.600 --> 00:46:29.600
you know, the basement or anything I'm talking about like if you


940
00:46:29.600 --> 00:46:32.300
know anything about the chakra system it is the root. It's at the


941
00:46:32.300 --> 00:46:35.200
bottom. It's the first thing that forms and literally as we


942
00:46:35.200 --> 00:46:38.600
grow we go through all of the houses and this


943
00:46:38.600 --> 00:46:41.200
is how we evolve you start here as a


944
00:46:41.200 --> 00:46:44.600
baby and then you you gain value and


945
00:46:44.600 --> 00:46:47.300
then you gain communication and then you connect with


946
00:46:47.300 --> 00:46:50.500
your mother and your home and the rest of your family and then


947
00:46:50.500 --> 00:46:53.300
it's about fun and then it's about Duty and chores.


948
00:46:53.300 --> 00:46:56.300
You see what I'm saying? It goes all the way around and the


949
00:46:56.300 --> 00:46:57.700
Cycles keep going in our life.


950
00:46:59.100 --> 00:47:02.300
It's a fire sign fire signs. There are four elements again


951
00:47:02.300 --> 00:47:06.500
fire signs are all about passion energy


952
00:47:05.500 --> 00:47:08.200
action.


953
00:47:09.200 --> 00:47:14.200
And they they have a lot to do with our our that's like


954
00:47:14.200 --> 00:47:17.600
using the word in a sentence in the dictionary, but they have to do with our fire our


955
00:47:17.600 --> 00:47:20.400
internal fire the thing that keeps us going. This is all about


956
00:47:20.400 --> 00:47:22.100
action and actually like movement.


957
00:47:24.700 --> 00:47:27.200
Sense of self the first house is the


958
00:47:27.200 --> 00:47:30.400
house of self and I think one of the most amazing things about


959
00:47:30.400 --> 00:47:33.200
the house of Self in specifically the ascendant is it


960
00:47:33.200 --> 00:47:36.200
rules your physical appearance? It rules your


961
00:47:36.200 --> 00:47:39.700
body. So this has to do with your sense of self and your


962
00:47:39.700 --> 00:47:42.300
Independence when you're talking about Martian energy.


963
00:47:42.300 --> 00:47:46.300
This is the me. It's just me, it's opposing.


964
00:47:47.700 --> 00:47:49.500
It's opposing the seventh house energy.


965
00:47:50.700 --> 00:47:53.500
You know what? I'm just gonna use this. It's opposing the seventh house


966
00:47:53.500 --> 00:47:56.900
energy which has to do with Partnerships, which we'll get to everything here.


967
00:47:56.900 --> 00:47:59.300
I want you to understand this as well. And I know I bounce


968
00:47:59.300 --> 00:48:03.200
around a little bit which is why this is great. You can just watch it afterwards but


969
00:48:02.200 --> 00:48:05.700
everything here is based on an axis.


970
00:48:05.700 --> 00:48:08.600
So whenever you're talking about the first house you always


971
00:48:08.600 --> 00:48:11.700
consider the opposition because life


972
00:48:11.700 --> 00:48:14.600
is about balance. And if you're too selfish that


973
00:48:14.600 --> 00:48:17.200
means your Partnerships fail if you get lost


974
00:48:17.200 --> 00:48:20.000
in your Partnerships, then you lose your sense of self.


975
00:48:20.900 --> 00:48:23.600
And as we go through the balance between the


976
00:48:23.600 --> 00:48:26.400
axis, that's what it's called in


977
00:48:26.400 --> 00:48:29.700
astrology 1 7 2 8 3


978
00:48:29.700 --> 00:48:32.600
9 4 10 5 11 6 12. So


979
00:48:32.600 --> 00:48:35.100
you may hear this term. I use this term every once in a


980
00:48:35.100 --> 00:48:38.400
while. This is the one seven axis. This has to do with you and


981
00:48:38.400 --> 00:48:38.700
other people.


982
00:48:39.700 --> 00:48:40.800
so when we start talking about


983
00:48:41.700 --> 00:48:44.700
You this is literally you without anybody


984
00:48:44.700 --> 00:48:47.300
else. This is you solo riding alone.


985
00:48:47.300 --> 00:48:50.400
It's the sense of self. It's a sense of being it's a


986
00:48:50.400 --> 00:48:53.700
sense of who am I? What am I really more?


987
00:48:53.700 --> 00:48:56.400
What am I Jupiter when we get the Sagittarius more?


988
00:48:56.400 --> 00:48:59.400
Who am I this is this is who slash what


989
00:48:59.400 --> 00:49:00.800
am I on a very personal level?


990
00:49:02.100 --> 00:49:05.300
It's your body. It's your physical appearance. When I do birth time


991
00:49:05.300 --> 00:49:08.100
rectification charts and I have you sitting in front


992
00:49:08.100 --> 00:49:11.700
of me doing a zoom rating. I look at what you look like. I pay


993
00:49:11.700 --> 00:49:14.100
attention. I look at your jawline as much as I can see


994
00:49:14.100 --> 00:49:17.100
within a zoom window. I look at your jawline. I look at the shade of


995
00:49:17.100 --> 00:49:20.200
your skin. I look at your hair. I look at how thick your hair


996
00:49:20.200 --> 00:49:23.100
is. I look to see if your style I look at your eyes to see


997
00:49:23.100 --> 00:49:27.300
what angle they are. Your eyebrows your forehead and


998
00:49:26.300 --> 00:49:29.500
each one has a different set


999
00:49:29.500 --> 00:49:31.400
of traits that make it obvious.


1000
00:49:32.400 --> 00:49:35.100
What makes it a bit more confusing is when you


1001
00:49:35.100 --> 00:49:38.500
have other planets in there and the ruler of the first house


1002
00:49:38.500 --> 00:49:41.200
is hitting a bunch of other planets. That's what makes it


1003
00:49:41.200 --> 00:49:44.800
more complicated when that's not happening. It's super easy. So it's


1004
00:49:44.800 --> 00:49:47.200
your body your physical appearance. I can tell you your height I


1005
00:49:47.200 --> 00:49:50.700
can tell you your weight. I can tell you if you were born thin


1006
00:49:50.700 --> 00:49:53.300
and get wider as you get older


1007
00:49:53.300 --> 00:49:56.200
or struggle with weight. A lot


1008
00:49:56.200 --> 00:49:59.100
of it has to do with with the first house and also with the first house


1009
00:49:59.100 --> 00:50:02.100
and it's ruler aspecting. Remember the ruler is


1010
00:50:02.100 --> 00:50:05.000
the planet that rules it so in the case of Aries


1011
00:50:05.800 --> 00:50:08.500
This is the glyph for Aries. And this


1012
00:50:08.500 --> 00:50:12.300
is the same on all of these. This is the Zodiac like


1013
00:50:11.300 --> 00:50:14.300
pick pictogram. I guess


1014
00:50:14.300 --> 00:50:17.000
would be the rest the best way to say it. This is what you're going


1015
00:50:17.100 --> 00:50:20.200
to see, you know on horoscopes and


1016
00:50:20.200 --> 00:50:23.900
things like that. You'll see this or sometimes if they're fancy you'll see this this


1017
00:50:23.900 --> 00:50:26.300
is what you're gonna see on the zodiac chart on


1018
00:50:26.300 --> 00:50:29.300
the wheel when your natal chart. This is Mars. The


1019
00:50:29.300 --> 00:50:32.200
Mars is the ruler of Aries and the ram is the


1020
00:50:32.200 --> 00:50:32.700
symbol.


1021
00:50:33.400 --> 00:50:36.600
So we're talked about Aries being the Cardinal sign meaning the first


1022
00:50:36.600 --> 00:50:39.800
of three. It goes Cardinal then fixed


1023
00:50:39.800 --> 00:50:42.200
then mutable and I'll explain the other two


1024
00:50:42.200 --> 00:50:45.500
when I get to the next two signs and then in the element of fire,


1025
00:50:45.500 --> 00:50:48.400
meaning passion and drive and you can actually see that it's


1026
00:50:48.400 --> 00:50:51.100
the first one the Cardinal sign the first one that


1027
00:50:51.100 --> 00:50:54.600
deals with action drive and passion which is why it's


1028
00:50:54.600 --> 00:50:57.600
anger Challenge and competitiveness and


1029
00:50:57.600 --> 00:50:58.400
reaction.


1030
00:50:59.400 --> 00:51:01.900
So wherever you find Mars, these are the themes.


1031
00:51:02.700 --> 00:51:05.000
now the difference between I should say


1032
00:51:05.200 --> 00:51:06.500
this the difference between the


1033
00:51:07.900 --> 00:51:11.500
Boop the house the sign


1034
00:51:10.500 --> 00:51:13.700
and the planet are that


1035
00:51:13.700 --> 00:51:16.700
this is where it happens in your life what area


1036
00:51:16.700 --> 00:51:19.600
of life it happens the themes of the area of


1037
00:51:19.600 --> 00:51:22.400
life. This is the theme of


1038
00:51:22.400 --> 00:51:24.000
how it plays out.


1039
00:51:24.900 --> 00:51:27.900
And this is what are we talking about planets


1040
00:51:27.900 --> 00:51:28.200
or what?


1041
00:51:30.100 --> 00:51:31.300
signs are how


1042
00:51:32.200 --> 00:51:33.600
houses are where?


1043
00:51:34.500 --> 00:51:37.000
and when you're reading charts, that's how you


1044
00:51:38.100 --> 00:51:41.300
discern when you're talking about the house versus


1045
00:51:41.300 --> 00:51:44.200
the planet versus the sign. How do you interpret that


1046
00:51:44.200 --> 00:51:47.400
now? You're not going to learn that in this class by Class 7. That's


1047
00:51:47.400 --> 00:51:50.400
gonna make a lot more sense as we go through practical examples.


1048
00:51:52.900 --> 00:51:55.300
sense of self-independence body physical appearance, whether


1049
00:51:55.300 --> 00:51:58.800
you have afflictions whether you're short tall big small


1050
00:51:58.800 --> 00:52:01.300
the color your skin how thick your hair is what type


1051
00:52:01.300 --> 00:52:05.100
of teeth you have if you have back problems, all of that is related


1052
00:52:04.100 --> 00:52:05.400
in


1053
00:52:06.400 --> 00:52:07.600
to their


1054
00:52:08.400 --> 00:52:10.900
I'm sorry. I didn't see this that the


1055
00:52:12.600 --> 00:52:15.200
I will create a PDF out of this and


1056
00:52:17.500 --> 00:52:20.500
I will create a PDF out of this and make sure that you


1057
00:52:20.500 --> 00:52:23.500
have it. I'm sorry. I forgot that you guys have questions over


1058
00:52:23.500 --> 00:52:26.800
here. I will put this together. I wasn't


1059
00:52:26.800 --> 00:52:29.100
sure honestly when I was doing this, I wasn't sure if


1060
00:52:29.100 --> 00:52:29.800
I was just gonna use


1061
00:52:31.300 --> 00:52:34.500
this and just talk about this or if


1062
00:52:34.500 --> 00:52:37.100
I was going to create this over here. So I ended up


1063
00:52:37.100 --> 00:52:40.600
doing this. Like I said like 10 minutes before I jumped on live and created


1064
00:52:40.600 --> 00:52:43.300
all of this in Photoshop like, you know


1065
00:52:43.300 --> 00:52:46.300
like this, so hopefully there's no typos or


1066
00:52:46.300 --> 00:52:48.400
misspellings and I'll double check that before I send it out.


1067
00:52:49.100 --> 00:52:52.100
Let's see do my son


1068
00:52:52.100 --> 00:52:54.700
is a Pisces name Micah meaning who is like God.


1069
00:52:55.500 --> 00:52:57.800
I love it. What are those three questions?


1070
00:53:00.500 --> 00:53:04.100
Oh the three questions, let me go back to that. Sorry. I


1071
00:53:03.100 --> 00:53:06.700
did just say it. The house


1072
00:53:06.700 --> 00:53:07.200
is


1073
00:53:08.700 --> 00:53:11.200
Where where in life are we


1074
00:53:11.200 --> 00:53:14.400
talking about? Where does this play out? The planet is


1075
00:53:14.400 --> 00:53:17.500
what? What are we talking about? Physically speaking. What is


1076
00:53:17.500 --> 00:53:21.300
it? That's working. What is it? That's moving around and the


1077
00:53:20.300 --> 00:53:23.500
sign is how how is


1078
00:53:23.500 --> 00:53:26.500
it playing out? What is the theme of what's playing out?


1079
00:53:26.500 --> 00:53:27.800
So this is more specific.


1080
00:53:28.900 --> 00:53:31.500
This is more thematic. And this is where this


1081
00:53:31.500 --> 00:53:34.200
is the location in your life so to


1082
00:53:34.200 --> 00:53:34.300
speak.


1083
00:53:36.400 --> 00:53:37.200
answer that


1084
00:53:40.200 --> 00:53:44.900
I know this for another class give yes, I can absolutely do that. What? Okay.


1085
00:53:43.900 --> 00:53:46.700
So what a


1086
00:53:46.700 --> 00:53:49.500
very easy one what your physical body right? So Mars


1087
00:53:49.500 --> 00:53:52.500
represents what your actual body looks like if you have a Mars and


1088
00:53:52.500 --> 00:53:55.200
Libra you have a graceful body. If you have a Mars and


1089
00:53:55.200 --> 00:53:58.200
Aquarius you have an alien like body where there's a good amount of


1090
00:53:58.200 --> 00:54:00.600
symmetry. You're kind of androgynous looking.


1091
00:54:01.700 --> 00:54:04.400
Um, if it is Capricorn, you


1092
00:54:04.400 --> 00:54:07.200
are a bit more rigid bit more structured, especially in


1093
00:54:07.200 --> 00:54:10.400
the jaw. The Jaws like nice and strong if it's


1094
00:54:10.400 --> 00:54:14.100
an Aries and I'm actually using how and


1095
00:54:13.100 --> 00:54:16.500
and what so what


1096
00:54:16.500 --> 00:54:19.100
is that? I'm using how Capricorn is the how


1097
00:54:19.100 --> 00:54:23.100
how does it play out? Well, it plays out like this. You have it like this Aries


1098
00:54:22.100 --> 00:54:26.800
plays out with a more structural body. Leo will


1099
00:54:26.800 --> 00:54:29.400
play out that you have a bit more broad


1100
00:54:29.400 --> 00:54:32.100
shoulders your hair is a bit more significant, assuming that


1101
00:54:32.100 --> 00:54:35.300
it's not poorly aspected to another planet and you'll


1102
00:54:35.300 --> 00:54:38.400
have an asymmetrical hairline. I don't know if you can tell but mine


1103
00:54:38.400 --> 00:54:39.300
is asymmetrical it goes


1104
00:54:40.300 --> 00:54:43.600
one of the ways and your skin has a reddish tint to


1105
00:54:43.600 --> 00:54:46.300
it. That's all Leo and you keep going through and


1106
00:54:46.300 --> 00:54:46.500
through


1107
00:54:47.500 --> 00:54:49.600
And then where is like?


1108
00:54:50.400 --> 00:54:53.600
If Mars is in Gemini, then


1109
00:54:53.600 --> 00:54:56.400
that that direction that passion ends


1110
00:54:56.400 --> 00:54:57.500
up in communication.


1111
00:54:58.300 --> 00:55:01.400
So you speak you speak fast. You speak a lot.


1112
00:55:01.400 --> 00:55:04.300
You speak direct your Blunt. You're you get to


1113
00:55:04.300 --> 00:55:07.900
the point and sometimes you say things that can


1114
00:55:07.900 --> 00:55:10.200
offend other people because again, it's the baby of


1115
00:55:10.200 --> 00:55:10.800
the zodiac.


1116
00:55:11.500 --> 00:55:12.700
So that's kind of how that plays.


1117
00:55:13.700 --> 00:55:16.500
out Mars sitting in the and


1118
00:55:16.500 --> 00:55:18.800
I'll do another classroom actually talking more about


1119
00:55:20.400 --> 00:55:23.200
Each planet I I saved this not for


1120
00:55:23.200 --> 00:55:26.800
the class because I'm going to do these on videos for our YouTube channel because I


1121
00:55:26.800 --> 00:55:28.800
don't like I don't want to regurgitate.


1122
00:55:29.600 --> 00:55:32.200
YouTube Google stuff that you can find


1123
00:55:32.200 --> 00:55:35.200
easily what I want to teach is the stuff that's not there and then


1124
00:55:35.200 --> 00:55:39.400
joined it in with our YouTube videos and whatnot. So I'll make sure pretty soon


1125
00:55:39.400 --> 00:55:42.100
that I get up bars in the first house Mars in the


1126
00:55:42.100 --> 00:55:45.300
second house and whatnot. And those are those are basic themes because


1127
00:55:45.300 --> 00:55:45.800
they don't


1128
00:55:46.900 --> 00:55:48.100
they don't take into account.


1129
00:55:49.100 --> 00:55:51.600
the ruler they don't take account, you know, the


1130
00:55:55.500 --> 00:55:56.400
the


1131
00:55:58.200 --> 00:56:01.000
aspects to the ruler or anything that's sitting in


1132
00:56:01.100 --> 00:56:03.900
there or that's what I was trying to get at planets that are in the first house.


1133
00:56:05.200 --> 00:56:06.000
so I hope that


1134
00:56:07.700 --> 00:56:08.500
was good.


1135
00:56:11.500 --> 00:56:14.500
No aspects, I'm sorry Patrick. I didn't see that question no


1136
00:56:14.500 --> 00:56:17.400
aspects in display and calculations for


1137
00:56:17.400 --> 00:56:20.300
right now when we get to another another class when


1138
00:56:20.300 --> 00:56:23.800
we start talking about aspects aspects you will


1139
00:56:23.800 --> 00:56:27.500
absolutely activate certain ones for basic


1140
00:56:27.500 --> 00:56:29.500
understanding so that makes that space.


1141
00:56:31.400 --> 00:56:34.800
So that makes sense because aspects are actually one


1142
00:56:34.800 --> 00:56:37.500
of the most important things but if you don't have the understanding of


1143
00:56:37.500 --> 00:56:40.300
the foundation, then the aspects just


1144
00:56:40.300 --> 00:56:43.500
end up all of this here and all


1145
00:56:43.500 --> 00:56:46.300
of this which is the basic aspects. This all just


1146
00:56:46.300 --> 00:56:49.200
ends up being extremely confusing and since I don't have the


1147
00:56:49.200 --> 00:56:52.200
asteroids and other things selected, this is just the


1148
00:56:52.200 --> 00:56:55.100
basic usually this thing goes, you know all the way


1149
00:56:55.100 --> 00:56:58.500
down here and there's a ton more going on but for Basics,


1150
00:56:58.500 --> 00:57:00.000
that's what I have.


1151
00:57:01.400 --> 00:57:04.300
All right. So when we go back to Aries here


1152
00:57:04.300 --> 00:57:07.100
anger challenge Mars is


1153
00:57:07.100 --> 00:57:10.500
also an Aries is also about where you challenge where you're competitive people


1154
00:57:10.500 --> 00:57:13.900
who have heavy areas or heavy Mars placements are


1155
00:57:13.900 --> 00:57:16.200
extremely competitive. They like challenging. These are the


1156
00:57:16.200 --> 00:57:19.200
people who are firefighters because of Courage. These are


1157
00:57:19.200 --> 00:57:22.300
the people who are usually in law enforcement. These are the people who are


1158
00:57:22.300 --> 00:57:26.400
athletes. These are all the very masculine things


1159
00:57:26.400 --> 00:57:29.600
you can think of is is Mars and that's why it rules


1160
00:57:29.600 --> 00:57:32.200
male. It rules the


1161
00:57:32.200 --> 00:57:36.300
body, you know women have Mars


1162
00:57:35.300 --> 00:57:38.200
but Venus is a very different thing and


1163
00:57:38.200 --> 00:57:39.500
we'll talk about that in the next sign.


1164
00:57:40.300 --> 00:57:44.800
The first house also in certain predictions, especially


1165
00:57:43.800 --> 00:57:46.200
when I do I call


1166
00:57:46.200 --> 00:57:49.200
it a marriage Transit right now, but I need to rename it because it's not when


1167
00:57:49.200 --> 00:57:51.900
you get married, it's just when your soul is ready to be with another person.


1168
00:57:52.800 --> 00:57:55.400
That specific type of calculation that


1169
00:57:55.400 --> 00:58:00.300
I do if you are attracted to men then we're


1170
00:57:58.300 --> 00:58:01.400
looking at the first house


1171
00:58:01.400 --> 00:58:04.100
for certain transits to go over if you're


1172
00:58:04.100 --> 00:58:07.500
interested in women, it's the second house because the second house is ruled


1173
00:58:07.500 --> 00:58:11.000
by Venus, which is extremely interesting. I love that


1174
00:58:10.100 --> 00:58:13.700
kind of stuff, but we're not there yet. And the


1175
00:58:13.700 --> 00:58:16.400
first house is also how you react. I


1176
00:58:16.400 --> 00:58:18.500
want to point this out real quick because people will say


1177
00:58:19.500 --> 00:58:22.100
Textbooks will say YouTube videos will say this


1178
00:58:22.100 --> 00:58:25.800
and people in like Reddit communities and everywhere that your mask


1179
00:58:25.800 --> 00:58:28.100
that the ascendant is a mask you wear


1180
00:58:28.100 --> 00:58:31.700
that it is not that important that it is not your personality.


1181
00:58:31.700 --> 00:58:34.700
That's not anything. The ascendant is the


1182
00:58:34.700 --> 00:58:37.400
physical moments the physical aspect


1183
00:58:37.400 --> 00:58:40.000
of who you are again, I'm gonna get to that when I go into


1184
00:58:42.900 --> 00:58:46.000
into angles that may


1185
00:58:45.200 --> 00:58:48.300
be in the next class. I have to get through these 12. I'm gonna


1186
00:58:48.300 --> 00:58:51.400
get as far as I can. I'm gonna bang out these 12 but it


1187
00:58:51.400 --> 00:58:54.200
is all about your reaction. It is


1188
00:58:54.200 --> 00:58:57.300
all about the foundation. The ascendant is in the first house the first house


1189
00:58:57.300 --> 00:59:00.900
the house of self that is all about your reactions.


1190
00:59:00.900 --> 00:59:03.400
It's about how you physically are


1191
00:59:03.400 --> 00:59:06.300
how you do things because this rule by areas and


1192
00:59:06.300 --> 00:59:09.700
rule by Mars courage initiating. It's also pioneering energy


1193
00:59:09.700 --> 00:59:13.100
and kind of Boss attitude because it's the first Aries wants


1194
00:59:13.100 --> 00:59:17.000
to do what areas wants to do and it's very difficult to have


1195
00:59:16.300 --> 00:59:19.000
somebody above you. It's the type of


1196
00:59:19.500 --> 00:59:19.900
Boss energy


1197
00:59:20.900 --> 00:59:23.400
That isn't as much about leadership as it


1198
00:59:23.400 --> 00:59:26.300
is about being able to tell people what to do and being okay with it.


1199
00:59:26.300 --> 00:59:30.000
So that is Aries. The second house is


1200
00:59:29.700 --> 00:59:32.700
Taurus. Second house


1201
00:59:32.700 --> 00:59:36.000
is ruled by Venus. This is the glyph for Venus. This


1202
00:59:35.200 --> 00:59:39.000
is the glypher Taurus


1203
00:59:38.400 --> 00:59:41.200
and it's the house of value.


1204
00:59:43.100 --> 00:59:46.300
When we go into here, this is Taurus. This


1205
00:59:46.300 --> 00:59:49.900
is again the glyph for Taurus. This is the the


1206
00:59:49.900 --> 00:59:51.100
bull for Taurus here.


1207
00:59:51.900 --> 00:59:54.100
And then this is the glyph that you'll


1208
00:59:54.100 --> 00:59:58.100
see on the natal wheel here for Venus Venus


1209
00:59:57.100 --> 01:00:00.300
is a co-ruling planet meaning it rules


1210
01:00:00.300 --> 01:00:02.700
Taurus and it also rules Libra, which we'll get to later.


1211
01:00:03.500 --> 01:00:04.000
fixed


1212
01:00:04.900 --> 01:00:07.900
is stubborn fixed means they do


1213
01:00:07.900 --> 01:00:10.400
and they continue to do and it's very hard


1214
01:00:10.400 --> 01:00:14.000
for them to shift. So when you talk about fixed signs, it's


1215
01:00:13.300 --> 01:00:16.700
very difficult for them to kind of go someone


1216
01:00:16.700 --> 01:00:19.600
else starts it they keep it going and they


1217
01:00:19.600 --> 01:00:22.700
don't change. It's it's the people who who


1218
01:00:22.700 --> 01:00:26.900
maintain these are the people and Earth


1219
01:00:26.900 --> 01:00:30.200
has to do with things that are practical has to do with value


1220
01:00:29.200 --> 01:00:32.400
and assets has to do with anything that's


1221
01:00:32.400 --> 01:00:35.300
of the earth including Taurus ruling mother nature,


1222
01:00:35.300 --> 01:00:37.700
which I have down here ruling nature.


1223
01:00:38.800 --> 01:00:39.000
so


1224
01:00:42.400 --> 01:00:45.900
yes, they're very grounded if you're looking for someone who is grounded extremely


1225
01:00:45.900 --> 01:00:46.600
grounded The Rock.


1226
01:00:47.500 --> 01:00:50.200
Not the actor, but the person who is a rock for you,


1227
01:00:50.200 --> 01:00:53.600
then you'll look for an earth sign or someone who has Earth prominent


1228
01:00:53.600 --> 01:00:56.500
in their chart Taurus is all about with venous


1229
01:00:56.500 --> 01:00:59.200
ruling is all about art and talent that is


1230
01:00:59.200 --> 01:01:02.300
also in your second house. If you want to find some of your talents ways to


1231
01:01:02.300 --> 01:01:06.500
make money how you make money how money comes in yourself value


1232
01:01:05.500 --> 01:01:09.000
your self-worth your possessions


1233
01:01:08.100 --> 01:01:11.300
the items you own and your relationship to those


1234
01:01:11.300 --> 01:01:14.300
what types of things do you buy how do you buy them what's important


1235
01:01:14.300 --> 01:01:17.700
to you when it comes to things of value including


1236
01:01:17.700 --> 01:01:20.500
your own values including how you


1237
01:01:21.600 --> 01:01:23.400
your manners basically


1238
01:01:24.200 --> 01:01:27.800
and then food being huge for Taurus Taurus


1239
01:01:27.800 --> 01:01:30.500
loves food. They love to eat their Foodies.


1240
01:01:30.500 --> 01:01:32.800
Every foodie has Taurus somewhere in their chart.


1241
01:01:33.600 --> 01:01:36.400
Your resources usually this is money, but it can


1242
01:01:36.400 --> 01:01:38.600
the other assets if they are your assets alone.


1243
01:01:39.500 --> 01:01:42.300
And then like I said nature when we go back to this chart


1244
01:01:42.300 --> 01:01:45.600
we're talking about the second eighth axis, which is Taurus and


1245
01:01:45.600 --> 01:01:48.400
Scorpio. That is the axis of money possessions and


1246
01:01:48.400 --> 01:01:51.200
value Taurus is your stuff.


1247
01:01:52.300 --> 01:01:55.700
Scorpio when we get to it, you'll see that is other people's stuff.


1248
01:01:55.700 --> 01:01:58.500
But this has to do with your money. It's


1249
01:01:58.500 --> 01:02:01.900
also the divine feminine as opposed to the Divine masculine


1250
01:02:01.900 --> 01:02:05.100
of Aries. This is whenever you see Venus sitting


1251
01:02:04.100 --> 01:02:07.800
somewhere in a chart you look at this glyph it


1252
01:02:07.800 --> 01:02:11.100
often means women it often means the feminine.


1253
01:02:10.100 --> 01:02:13.000
It also means anything that has to do


1254
01:02:13.200 --> 01:02:15.900
with Elegance that's going to be Venus here.


1255
01:02:16.800 --> 01:02:19.600
Moving forward to the third house. This is


1256
01:02:19.600 --> 01:02:22.300
ruled by Gemini Gemini of


1257
01:02:22.300 --> 01:02:25.600
the third house here. This is the symbol for mercury Mercury.


1258
01:02:25.600 --> 01:02:28.600
Rules Gemini. This is the glyph 4 Gemini. This


1259
01:02:28.600 --> 01:02:31.900
is what you're going to see as a symbol it is the house of communication.


1260
01:02:33.300 --> 01:02:37.500
When we go to the next slide here Gemini is


1261
01:02:37.500 --> 01:02:40.600
looks like this. This is the glyph again and


1262
01:02:40.600 --> 01:02:43.400
it is the Twins and the thing


1263
01:02:43.400 --> 01:02:46.400
most people notice about Taurus. I'm sorry


1264
01:02:46.400 --> 01:02:49.900
Gemini. Well thing people notice about Taurus that they can be stubborn. That's


1265
01:02:49.900 --> 01:02:52.400
the fixed energy in Gemini the


1266
01:02:52.400 --> 01:02:55.100
thing that you can notice they're all over the place, they're erratic and


1267
01:02:55.100 --> 01:02:58.800
these are the people who you say are ADHD and bipolar


1268
01:02:58.800 --> 01:03:01.500
and the thing is when you get


1269
01:03:01.500 --> 01:03:04.700
to a point where you're medicating this if it's if it's


1270
01:03:04.700 --> 01:03:07.400
aspecting Jupiter or sitting squaring something


1271
01:03:07.400 --> 01:03:08.000
or whatever.


1272
01:03:09.200 --> 01:03:12.000
Just ill aspected then. Yeah, there could be


1273
01:03:12.900 --> 01:03:15.300
some intervention needed in some way. Obviously we


1274
01:03:15.300 --> 01:03:16.800
prefer holistic intervention.


1275
01:03:17.400 --> 01:03:20.700
But it can be more extreme. The average Gemini is


1276
01:03:20.700 --> 01:03:23.400
not bipolar. They do not have ADHD, but everyone


1277
01:03:23.400 --> 01:03:26.600
around them thinks that they're both of those things. What it


1278
01:03:26.600 --> 01:03:29.900
is is they see two sides of the same thing. They attack


1279
01:03:29.900 --> 01:03:32.200
things from multiple angles because they're the


1280
01:03:32.200 --> 01:03:35.400
ones who will argue both points and they may not


1281
01:03:35.400 --> 01:03:38.400
even really have a point. These are The Debaters. These


1282
01:03:38.400 --> 01:03:41.900
are the ones that like to get into not necessarily


1283
01:03:41.900 --> 01:03:43.200
arguments. Unless Mars is there.


1284
01:03:44.200 --> 01:03:47.300
But definitely like to get into conversation with people and then the flip the


1285
01:03:47.300 --> 01:03:50.300
side if you're talking about one thing they may sit there and talk about the other thing,


1286
01:03:50.300 --> 01:03:53.500
you know the opposing view just because it's fun


1287
01:03:53.500 --> 01:03:54.900
for them. They're intellectuals.


1288
01:03:55.800 --> 01:03:58.800
Mutable meaning they change often and


1289
01:03:58.800 --> 01:04:02.500
this is has to do with the The Duality nature


1290
01:04:01.500 --> 01:04:04.600
of Gemini mutable is


1291
01:04:04.600 --> 01:04:07.600
always about changing. So you have the Cardinal that


1292
01:04:07.600 --> 01:04:07.900
starts it.


1293
01:04:08.700 --> 01:04:11.200
You have the fixed that keeps it going


1294
01:04:11.200 --> 01:04:14.600
and then you have the mutable that changes Direction now mutable


1295
01:04:14.600 --> 01:04:18.000
is great for having ideas and


1296
01:04:17.400 --> 01:04:20.500
coming up


1297
01:04:20.500 --> 01:04:23.800
with the next idea meaning they're like the end of it. They don't


1298
01:04:23.800 --> 01:04:26.400
they don't like to finish anything. That's where


1299
01:04:26.400 --> 01:04:29.500
you need the fixed in there and even cardinal signs. Sometimes are


1300
01:04:29.500 --> 01:04:32.800
pretty good at finishing things, but mutable noted not


1301
01:04:32.800 --> 01:04:35.800
at all Air signs have to do with intelligence communication


1302
01:04:35.800 --> 01:04:38.400
logic. Those are the main things air is


1303
01:04:38.400 --> 01:04:41.100
very quick fast moving and it's


1304
01:04:41.100 --> 01:04:42.000
all cerebral.


1305
01:04:43.500 --> 01:04:46.500
Thinking ideas identity. I


1306
01:04:46.500 --> 01:04:49.700
think the main thing that people Miss astrologers in


1307
01:04:49.700 --> 01:04:52.900
general about the third house is identity.


1308
01:04:52.900 --> 01:04:55.100
People forget that it has


1309
01:04:55.100 --> 01:04:59.500
to do with mindset meaning it has to do with your actual identity. Not


1310
01:04:59.500 --> 01:05:02.500
your personality identity, but your actual mental


1311
01:05:02.500 --> 01:05:03.200
identity.


1312
01:05:04.900 --> 01:05:08.300
I call my daughter push me pull you. Yeah, that's


1313
01:05:08.300 --> 01:05:11.200
that Gemini energy. It's they just


1314
01:05:11.200 --> 01:05:14.400
they love that it has to do with how you speak. It


1315
01:05:14.400 --> 01:05:17.600
has to do with your communication. How you communicate? How effective are


1316
01:05:17.600 --> 01:05:20.700
you communicating? Do you need to do it slow do you talk fast


1317
01:05:20.700 --> 01:05:23.300
do you speak eloquently do you speak and that


1318
01:05:23.300 --> 01:05:25.300
all has to do with what planets and and


1319
01:05:26.500 --> 01:05:29.900
And signs are in the third house. Remember, these are all third house


1320
01:05:29.900 --> 01:05:32.300
based where Mercury is and where Gemini is


1321
01:05:32.300 --> 01:05:33.700
it? All has to do with these themes.


1322
01:05:34.600 --> 01:05:37.700
Early and quick learning meaning Early Education


1323
01:05:37.700 --> 01:05:40.200
like K-12 anything that you're


1324
01:05:40.200 --> 01:05:44.000
starting to learn is is Gemini


1325
01:05:43.500 --> 01:05:47.000
anything that has to do with facts. They're less.


1326
01:05:46.300 --> 01:05:49.100
They're more about logic and facts and less about


1327
01:05:49.100 --> 01:05:52.200
the philosophy and anything as quick learning. I just need


1328
01:05:52.200 --> 01:05:55.700
to learn this real quick so that I can do this. I'm not trying to get deep involved


1329
01:05:55.700 --> 01:05:58.400
in it. They're very surface. Gemini energy is


1330
01:05:58.400 --> 01:06:01.300
very surface. It also has to do with siblings cousins and


1331
01:06:01.300 --> 01:06:01.800
Neighbors.


1332
01:06:02.800 --> 01:06:05.300
So when you're talking about the oh and coworkers, which


1333
01:06:05.300 --> 01:06:08.900
is not on here but siblings cousins neighbors and co-workers. That


1334
01:06:08.900 --> 01:06:12.100
is all ruled by Gemini third house and Mercury


1335
01:06:13.200 --> 01:06:16.500
And then driving short trips also your local environment and your


1336
01:06:16.500 --> 01:06:19.200
neighborhood is all ruled by your third house


1337
01:06:19.200 --> 01:06:22.300
Gemini and Mercury. So these


1338
01:06:22.300 --> 01:06:25.200
are the main traits and elements of


1339
01:06:25.200 --> 01:06:28.200
that the fourth house here


1340
01:06:28.200 --> 01:06:30.600
is ruled by the moon.


1341
01:06:31.500 --> 01:06:34.300
Which is most people's favorite when they're in spirituality.


1342
01:06:34.300 --> 01:06:37.400
It is cancer and it is about the


1343
01:06:37.400 --> 01:06:38.300
home and family.


1344
01:06:39.800 --> 01:06:42.600
When we go forward here. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.


1345
01:06:42.600 --> 01:06:45.100
I bounce around all the time third and Ninth has


1346
01:06:45.100 --> 01:06:48.600
to do with fact versus opinion lower versus


1347
01:06:48.600 --> 01:06:51.400
higher education. It's this is the third ninth


1348
01:06:51.400 --> 01:06:54.000
axis. The fourth tenth axis has to


1349
01:06:54.100 --> 01:06:57.200
do with home and family your inner World your inner self everything


1350
01:06:57.200 --> 01:07:00.300
that happens early in life and at home this is


1351
01:07:00.300 --> 01:07:03.300
later in life and outward. This


1352
01:07:03.300 --> 01:07:06.600
is your public. So this has to do with home and work


1353
01:07:06.600 --> 01:07:09.300
basically your fourth tenth axis when I


1354
01:07:09.300 --> 01:07:12.300
get into cancer energy here again, we're back


1355
01:07:12.300 --> 01:07:15.200
to Cardinal because there's only three Cardinal means it's the beginning


1356
01:07:15.200 --> 01:07:18.700
of a season so we had Aries starting


1357
01:07:18.700 --> 01:07:21.400
spring cancer technically start


1358
01:07:21.400 --> 01:07:21.900
summer.


1359
01:07:22.500 --> 01:07:25.600
So summer starts in cancer. This is the glyph for cancer. It's


1360
01:07:25.600 --> 01:07:28.300
the crab and then it's ruled by the moon and this


1361
01:07:28.300 --> 01:07:30.200
is the glyph you'll find on your chart.


1362
01:07:31.200 --> 01:07:34.100
Or back to water signs not back. I'm sorry. It's the first


1363
01:07:34.100 --> 01:07:38.200
one four elements water signs are all about emotion intuition


1364
01:07:37.200 --> 01:07:40.300
feelings mood. They're the


1365
01:07:40.300 --> 01:07:43.600
nurturers and it's three different ways. But this is very deep


1366
01:07:43.600 --> 01:07:46.400
or in a very emotional non-logical level very


1367
01:07:46.400 --> 01:07:47.000
fluid.


1368
01:07:48.100 --> 01:07:51.300
The cancer the fourth house and the moon


1369
01:07:51.300 --> 01:07:55.100
are all about the home mother or maternal figures


1370
01:07:54.100 --> 01:07:57.700
family roots and ancestry.


1371
01:07:58.900 --> 01:08:01.800
So everything that where you came from is here,


1372
01:08:01.800 --> 01:08:04.500
it also can represent your home country depending on


1373
01:08:04.500 --> 01:08:07.600
what lens you're looking at through their lenses.


1374
01:08:07.600 --> 01:08:10.200
I will get to and another another class as well.


1375
01:08:11.200 --> 01:08:13.500
Which has to do with switching Focus, basically.


1376
01:08:14.400 --> 01:08:17.400
Cancer rules, like I said emotions mood


1377
01:08:17.400 --> 01:08:20.200
and feelings and how you react to them. But not only the


1378
01:08:20.200 --> 01:08:23.200
feelings you have but your relationship to your


1379
01:08:23.200 --> 01:08:26.900
own feelings your relationship to how you process emotions.


1380
01:08:26.900 --> 01:08:29.600
And that's extremely important to understand that because


1381
01:08:29.600 --> 01:08:32.400
it's not just I'm a cancer. So I'm emotional


1382
01:08:32.400 --> 01:08:35.300
it, you know, they're actually more like the crab


1383
01:08:35.300 --> 01:08:39.600
hard shell soft inside, but they're


1384
01:08:38.600 --> 01:08:41.200
the they're the nurturers. They're


1385
01:08:41.200 --> 01:08:44.500
the ones who have to be not the earth rock, but the


1386
01:08:44.500 --> 01:08:47.300
water Rock they're the ones who have to be emotionally strong for


1387
01:08:47.300 --> 01:08:50.000
everybody as a cardinal sign the protectors.


1388
01:08:50.900 --> 01:08:53.300
Which is interesting a Scorpio has that too on a


1389
01:08:53.300 --> 01:08:56.400
very different level people don't realize that so nurturing and


1390
01:08:56.400 --> 01:08:59.900
caring you see a lot of people in healthcare in just in


1391
01:08:59.900 --> 01:09:02.200
like foster care and all that. They have


1392
01:09:02.200 --> 01:09:05.100
a lot of this stay at home moms. Definitely have this kind of


1393
01:09:05.100 --> 01:09:08.300
energy as well foundations meaning where you came


1394
01:09:08.300 --> 01:09:11.200
from and that kind of ties into all


1395
01:09:11.200 --> 01:09:14.000
of this but it goes deeper it has to do with things that


1396
01:09:14.100 --> 01:09:17.300
are extremely personal to you that you would never reveal to other


1397
01:09:17.300 --> 01:09:20.900
people not Secrets, which is personal things


1398
01:09:20.900 --> 01:09:22.300
that you don't want the public to know.


1399
01:09:23.200 --> 01:09:26.100
Your physical home. So when you're looking at careers, sometimes this is


1400
01:09:26.100 --> 01:09:29.300
how you see real estate or anything related to


1401
01:09:29.300 --> 01:09:32.400
that or working from home and then your intuition


1402
01:09:32.400 --> 01:09:35.300
and what most again what most people forget about


1403
01:09:35.300 --> 01:09:37.100
is that it's also your fears.


1404
01:09:37.800 --> 01:09:41.100
And if you look at your chart, wherever


1405
01:09:40.100 --> 01:09:43.800
the moon sits in your chart that degree give


1406
01:09:43.800 --> 01:09:46.600
or take a degree is the


1407
01:09:46.600 --> 01:09:49.300
age in which you had some sort


1408
01:09:49.300 --> 01:09:52.400
of fear relating to the themes of this


1409
01:09:52.400 --> 01:09:52.900
house.


1410
01:09:54.600 --> 01:09:58.200
So that's that's something when we get to Capricorn Saturn.


1411
01:09:57.200 --> 01:10:01.200
This is also the degree has


1412
01:10:00.200 --> 01:10:03.300
a significance as well within the


1413
01:10:03.300 --> 01:10:06.200
themes that we're talking about. So fears are a


1414
01:10:06.200 --> 01:10:10.400
huge part where your moon sits and how it's aspecting will


1415
01:10:09.400 --> 01:10:12.200
indicate the types of fears that


1416
01:10:12.200 --> 01:10:12.500
you have.


1417
01:10:13.900 --> 01:10:16.900
It's also your intuition and it's not psychic ability.


1418
01:10:16.900 --> 01:10:20.000
It is intuition. The term mothers intuition


1419
01:10:19.600 --> 01:10:22.800
is actually just this it's cancer


1420
01:10:22.800 --> 01:10:25.300
rule by the moon in the fourth house. This is


1421
01:10:25.300 --> 01:10:28.600
the mother's intuition at home. It's literally all three things that it's


1422
01:10:28.600 --> 01:10:31.800
ruling in its in its home state and they've


1423
01:10:31.800 --> 01:10:34.900
nicknamed it in the real world as a mother's intuition,


1424
01:10:34.900 --> 01:10:37.700
but everybody has it it just


1425
01:10:37.700 --> 01:10:40.500
sits in different areas of life people who are Aries Rising


1426
01:10:40.500 --> 01:10:43.400
with the moon and the fourth house. They have it


1427
01:10:43.400 --> 01:10:43.700
heavy.


1428
01:10:44.500 --> 01:10:46.400
Assuming that it's not poorly aspected.


1429
01:10:47.400 --> 01:10:50.000
When we get into the fifth house, we're talking about


1430
01:10:50.700 --> 01:10:53.900
Leo and we're talking about the fifth 11th house access. This


1431
01:10:53.900 --> 01:10:56.100
has to do with your own creative talents your


1432
01:10:56.100 --> 01:10:59.300
own creative ability your kids people the peoples the


1433
01:10:59.300 --> 01:11:03.300
little people who are yours versus the people who are not yours up


1434
01:11:02.300 --> 01:11:05.200
here and then, you know


1435
01:11:05.200 --> 01:11:08.600
outward expression and it's not everyone else's


1436
01:11:08.600 --> 01:11:11.300
it's hopes and dreams and Stuffs the


1437
01:11:11.300 --> 01:11:14.100
stuff that you don't have the creative expression. You don't have that


1438
01:11:14.100 --> 01:11:17.900
you wish you did have is the opposite side but Leo


1439
01:11:17.900 --> 01:11:20.500
here. This is the sun. This is the glyph and


1440
01:11:20.500 --> 01:11:23.200
it's the house up pleasure, but you


1441
01:11:23.200 --> 01:11:25.500
can also call it the house of children and romance.


1442
01:11:26.600 --> 01:11:29.100
So Leo, let's move this


1443
01:11:29.100 --> 01:11:32.400
over a little bit Leo. We're back to the lion


1444
01:11:32.400 --> 01:11:35.500
again. The two glyphs it's a fixed sign


1445
01:11:35.500 --> 01:11:38.200
and it's a fire sign Leo's do not


1446
01:11:38.200 --> 01:11:41.200
like to change Leos are quite stubborn Leo energy


1447
01:11:41.200 --> 01:11:44.400
likes what Leo likes and it doesn't typically change


1448
01:11:44.400 --> 01:11:46.700
unless it's coerced or there are other


1449
01:11:48.500 --> 01:11:49.800
energies that are impacting


1450
01:11:50.600 --> 01:11:53.100
fire sign it's all about passion which is why it


1451
01:11:53.100 --> 01:11:56.300
has to do with energy and out. We're


1452
01:11:56.300 --> 01:11:56.800
going and


1453
01:11:58.100 --> 01:12:00.400
The card I also want to say that cardinal.


1454
01:12:01.200 --> 01:12:03.200
Energy when it starts. It's like


1455
01:12:04.200 --> 01:12:07.600
a lot of energy up front and it Fizzles


1456
01:12:07.600 --> 01:12:10.100
out fixed is not as much


1457
01:12:10.100 --> 01:12:11.600
energy, but it can be maintained.


1458
01:12:12.600 --> 01:12:16.000
And then mutable is spurts of


1459
01:12:16.300 --> 01:12:19.300
a lot of energy it comes and it's very kind of all over


1460
01:12:19.300 --> 01:12:22.200
so whether it's fire water Earth or air


1461
01:12:22.200 --> 01:12:23.500
that's kind of how it works.


1462
01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:25.400
children


1463
01:12:26.500 --> 01:12:29.800
And fertility, it's not just kids. It's not just do you


1464
01:12:29.800 --> 01:12:32.800
have kids or how many do you have or how you


1465
01:12:32.800 --> 01:12:35.500
know, how are each one? It's also the first child


1466
01:12:35.500 --> 01:12:37.000
so when you're looking at


1467
01:12:39.400 --> 01:12:42.300
When you're looking at Leo in a chart, this is not only


1468
01:12:42.300 --> 01:12:45.100
children. And will you have kids and their traits and kind


1469
01:12:45.100 --> 01:12:48.000
of how they'll be but your first child


1470
01:12:48.800 --> 01:12:51.600
specifically. What is the relationship with your first child? The second


1471
01:12:51.600 --> 01:12:53.100
child is actually the seventh house.


1472
01:12:54.500 --> 01:12:58.200
The third child is the ninth house it skips around 11th one


1473
01:12:57.200 --> 01:13:00.200
three five. So when you get to this one


1474
01:13:00.200 --> 01:13:02.600
your first one and this one are kind of similar.


1475
01:13:03.400 --> 01:13:06.300
Interestingly enough when we get to Partnerships in the seventh house.


1476
01:13:06.300 --> 01:13:09.300
Your relationship has the same energy as your your


1477
01:13:09.300 --> 01:13:12.300
first marriage has the same energy as your second child.


1478
01:13:13.100 --> 01:13:14.700
Which is I think very interesting.


1479
01:13:15.900 --> 01:13:18.200
Doesn't mean you have the same relationship. It doesn't


1480
01:13:18.200 --> 01:13:21.100
play out necessarily the same because you're dealing with different people. But if


1481
01:13:21.100 --> 01:13:22.900
you look at it, the themes are very similar.


1482
01:13:24.100 --> 01:13:27.700
Creative expression. This is where your talents are in a


1483
01:13:27.700 --> 01:13:30.300
less about the value of your talent what you


1484
01:13:30.300 --> 01:13:33.100
can do with your talent and this is how you express that Talent. This is


1485
01:13:33.100 --> 01:13:36.300
how you express your creativity. How are you creative? How do


1486
01:13:36.300 --> 01:13:39.300
you do it? How do you use this talent in what


1487
01:13:39.300 --> 01:13:42.300
way do you do it? What way or is it fun? It's also


1488
01:13:42.300 --> 01:13:45.400
about Vitality. What makes you happy? What brings you


1489
01:13:45.400 --> 01:13:47.500
life? What's what is Gonna Make You


1490
01:13:49.400 --> 01:13:52.700
kind of get up out of bed every day


1491
01:13:52.700 --> 01:13:56.200
and want to live and want to do the things you're doing. Ironically


1492
01:13:55.200 --> 01:13:56.800
speaking.


1493
01:13:58.700 --> 01:14:02.100
Pop culture astrology is based around the sun sign yet.


1494
01:14:01.100 --> 01:14:04.500
Most people ignore their sun sign


1495
01:14:04.500 --> 01:14:08.800
when they're doing their career and I find that ironic when


1496
01:14:07.800 --> 01:14:10.300
I do a lot of readings for career. I'm


1497
01:14:10.300 --> 01:14:13.300
always saying but what about your sun sign? What about your son sign


1498
01:14:13.300 --> 01:14:16.600
because it is very important. It's one of the three it's two it's one of the two luminaries


1499
01:14:16.600 --> 01:14:17.500
the Sun and the Moon.


1500
01:14:18.200 --> 01:14:21.300
And it is the one about happiness. So when


1501
01:14:21.300 --> 01:14:23.400
you're doing your job, are you happy?


1502
01:14:24.300 --> 01:14:28.600
If not, how can you appease this romance? Like


1503
01:14:28.600 --> 01:14:31.800
puppy love the way you're actually romantically connected Leos


1504
01:14:31.800 --> 01:14:33.000
are natural Romantics.


1505
01:14:33.900 --> 01:14:36.300
The fifth house is where your romance is


1506
01:14:36.300 --> 01:14:39.200
how it plays out pleasure. Meaning, you know.


1507
01:14:40.200 --> 01:14:43.800
Toying around and just the things you do for fun Pride ego


1508
01:14:43.800 --> 01:14:46.600
and drama Leo's love drama. This


1509
01:14:46.600 --> 01:14:49.400
is also what area of Life what's in


1510
01:14:49.400 --> 01:14:52.600
your fifth house that tends to be dramatic. You


1511
01:14:52.600 --> 01:14:54.600
know, what's usually dramatic your first kid.


1512
01:14:55.700 --> 01:14:58.200
Your first kid is usually dramatic because it's your first


1513
01:14:58.200 --> 01:14:58.500
one.


1514
01:14:59.200 --> 01:15:02.200
The second one. It's like I've already dealt with one and now I know


1515
01:15:02.200 --> 01:15:05.500
how to handle this which is why it's in Libra the one-on-one house.


1516
01:15:05.500 --> 01:15:07.400
You're more in tune with it.


1517
01:15:08.500 --> 01:15:11.600
Has to do with your ego has to do with your pride whenever


1518
01:15:11.600 --> 01:15:14.700
the sun is sitting there. You have to be careful that you don't overdo


1519
01:15:14.700 --> 01:15:17.200
the sun's energy and that you maintain balance because


1520
01:15:17.200 --> 01:15:20.300
this is where you can get you can go


1521
01:15:20.300 --> 01:15:23.600
overboard also has to do with Recreation and entertainment.


1522
01:15:23.600 --> 01:15:26.800
What type of movies do you like? What type of or movies


1523
01:15:26.800 --> 01:15:29.800
is more 12th house? But what type of entertainment do


1524
01:15:29.800 --> 01:15:32.300
you like sports sports is actually ruled by the fifth house as well


1525
01:15:32.300 --> 01:15:35.200
Recreation and Entertainment Sports, but what


1526
01:15:35.200 --> 01:15:38.700
do you do? What are your hobbies? What are the types of things you like to go? See what


1527
01:15:38.700 --> 01:15:41.200
type of events do you like? You know, how do you handle your


1528
01:15:41.200 --> 01:15:43.200
free time is there?


1529
01:15:45.300 --> 01:15:46.700
I'm sorry I missed your


1530
01:15:50.200 --> 01:15:53.300
Your question Taylor, I'm gonna go back to third house


1531
01:15:53.300 --> 01:15:57.600
real quick and tell you mental identity. So Gemini


1532
01:15:56.600 --> 01:15:59.700
is all about mindset. It


1533
01:15:59.700 --> 01:16:02.800
has to do literally with the brain Gemini rules


1534
01:16:02.800 --> 01:16:05.600
for the most part rules. The brain. It's ruled


1535
01:16:05.600 --> 01:16:08.300
by Mercury Virgo co-rules in a very different way. It's


1536
01:16:08.300 --> 01:16:11.700
a different section different side of the brain. But this is your actual


1537
01:16:11.700 --> 01:16:15.200
identity. It is the like I said before the ID meaning


1538
01:16:16.200 --> 01:16:19.500
your mental acuity. How smart


1539
01:16:19.500 --> 01:16:22.500
you are how you think how you communicate how you speak? How


1540
01:16:22.500 --> 01:16:24.400
you get what's in the brain out?


1541
01:16:25.400 --> 01:16:28.100
And whether it comes out because you know,


1542
01:16:28.100 --> 01:16:31.300
if you have Saturn or something else, you might not speak that much


1543
01:16:31.300 --> 01:16:33.000
you may speak slower. You may only speak when


1544
01:16:33.900 --> 01:16:35.800
something is worth saying


1545
01:16:36.600 --> 01:16:39.200
but this has to do with literally if you're looking for


1546
01:16:39.200 --> 01:16:42.200
how you learn something. If you're


1547
01:16:42.200 --> 01:16:45.500
looking to change your mindset and your state


1548
01:16:45.500 --> 01:16:48.800
of mind, you're gonna look to Mercury you're gonna look to the third house and wherever


1549
01:16:48.800 --> 01:16:49.500
Gemini is


1550
01:16:50.500 --> 01:16:53.400
so that is your your mental identity as opposed


1551
01:16:53.400 --> 01:16:56.900
to actually where we are now, which is Leo, which


1552
01:16:56.900 --> 01:16:59.200
is your personality, which is


1553
01:16:59.200 --> 01:17:02.200
Aries a little bit as well. But Leo is


1554
01:17:02.200 --> 01:17:03.400
your personality in terms of


1555
01:17:04.400 --> 01:17:07.300
How you're out there Leo likes the spotlight so


1556
01:17:07.300 --> 01:17:08.000
when you're out there.


1557
01:17:08.800 --> 01:17:11.300
how how do you act this is how you


1558
01:17:11.300 --> 01:17:14.300
actually this is you the first house is


1559
01:17:14.300 --> 01:17:15.200
how you act in a


1560
01:17:16.600 --> 01:17:19.400
Not robotic way but in a this is what my body does.


1561
01:17:19.400 --> 01:17:22.500
This is how my body does but when I'm being me so


1562
01:17:22.500 --> 01:17:25.300
to speak that's your fifth house. That's your son. That's


1563
01:17:25.300 --> 01:17:28.400
your Leo. So seeing how when you see somebody with


1564
01:17:28.400 --> 01:17:31.600
Leo in the 12th house or something in the 12th house. They're usually


1565
01:17:31.600 --> 01:17:34.700
not as out there now going unless this unless


1566
01:17:34.700 --> 01:17:37.300
Leo in the 12th house. The sun being its ruler is,


1567
01:17:37.300 --> 01:17:40.400
you know, either in the 10th or the seventh or the fifth house or something


1568
01:17:40.400 --> 01:17:42.000
like that then yeah, they're gonna be excitable.


1569
01:17:42.900 --> 01:17:46.100
But if they're both sitting in the 12th house which is isolation, you


1570
01:17:45.100 --> 01:17:48.100
know time to themselves. It won't play out that


1571
01:17:48.100 --> 01:17:51.800
way but the third house Gemini is about your mental identity.


1572
01:17:51.800 --> 01:17:54.500
Leo is about your creative expression


1573
01:17:54.500 --> 01:17:55.700
and your personality.


1574
01:17:57.600 --> 01:18:00.700
All right. Let's go to avoid you are


1575
01:18:00.700 --> 01:18:03.100
Virgo. Here's the ruler of the sixth house.


1576
01:18:03.100 --> 01:18:06.600
I made a video joking about how Virgo


1577
01:18:06.600 --> 01:18:10.500
doesn't have a fun side because it's


1578
01:18:10.500 --> 01:18:13.600
it's the Mercury that comes second. It's


1579
01:18:13.600 --> 01:18:16.400
also ruled by Mercury and it's squares again. We'll get into aspects


1580
01:18:16.400 --> 01:18:19.300
later but squares College attention and friction. It squares


1581
01:18:19.300 --> 01:18:22.500
the one that came first. So this one's all fun. This one's


1582
01:18:22.500 --> 01:18:25.200
all work and they fight with each other. It's like


1583
01:18:25.200 --> 01:18:28.400
I want to I Just Want to Have Fun. I want to learn different things. No, you


1584
01:18:28.400 --> 01:18:31.400
have to organize yourself and do it, right? This is a fun little sketch. I'll


1585
01:18:31.400 --> 01:18:32.200
do at some point, but


1586
01:18:33.100 --> 01:18:36.200
this is these are the glyphs and it's the house of


1587
01:18:36.200 --> 01:18:39.600
work and health when you get into it the glyphs


1588
01:18:39.600 --> 01:18:43.100
the Virgin is the is the


1589
01:18:42.100 --> 01:18:46.100
symbol mutable meaning it is changeable, which


1590
01:18:45.100 --> 01:18:47.300
is great for for a


1591
01:18:48.200 --> 01:18:50.100
Sign that doesn't seem to have a fun side.


1592
01:18:51.800 --> 01:18:54.400
And it's it can change and organize and schedule


1593
01:18:54.400 --> 01:18:57.600
and do anything that needs to be done. That's the the beauty


1594
01:18:57.600 --> 01:19:00.200
about Virgo's Virgo is extremely important because it


1595
01:19:00.200 --> 01:19:00.900
also rules.


1596
01:19:01.600 --> 01:19:04.200
The material world meaning the world. We live in


1597
01:19:04.200 --> 01:19:07.200
the one we have to interact with is why it's an earth


1598
01:19:07.200 --> 01:19:07.500
sign.


1599
01:19:08.600 --> 01:19:12.100
Even though Mercury's technically an error


1600
01:19:11.100 --> 01:19:14.300
should be an air sign. It's Earth because


1601
01:19:14.300 --> 01:19:17.600
it literally has to do with how we mentally process


1602
01:19:17.600 --> 01:19:20.700
and deal with our real world. So your


1603
01:19:20.700 --> 01:19:23.600
sixth house Virgo and that side of mercury has


1604
01:19:23.600 --> 01:19:26.300
to do with that. Now when you're reading mercury in the chart, there is no real


1605
01:19:26.300 --> 01:19:29.300
deciphering. Is this Mercury Virgo or is


1606
01:19:29.300 --> 01:19:32.300
this Mercury Gemini? It's just Mercury and it deals with all of


1607
01:19:32.300 --> 01:19:35.200
this. So you literally take third house and sixth house


1608
01:19:35.200 --> 01:19:37.100
when you're looking at mercury in a chart and you pull them together.


1609
01:19:37.900 --> 01:19:40.300
And that's you just discern it that way but it


1610
01:19:40.300 --> 01:19:41.500
has it always has to do with the mind.


1611
01:19:42.800 --> 01:19:45.300
It has to do with work. If you are a boss it


1612
01:19:45.300 --> 01:19:48.900
has to do with your employees. Not your coworkers that


1613
01:19:48.900 --> 01:19:51.500
was third house has to do with your employees and


1614
01:19:51.500 --> 01:19:55.000
it has to do with your routine your job also chores


1615
01:19:54.400 --> 01:19:58.500
anything that's daily that you have to do your


1616
01:19:57.500 --> 01:20:00.200
responsibilities on a very


1617
01:20:00.200 --> 01:20:03.100
like errand type way.


1618
01:20:04.200 --> 01:20:07.300
That is Virgo service to others. The biggest thing


1619
01:20:07.300 --> 01:20:10.200
for Virgo is in the real world. How are you


1620
01:20:10.200 --> 01:20:13.400
of service to other people when you physically have to


1621
01:20:13.400 --> 01:20:16.100
do something for somebody else your sense of Duty?


1622
01:20:17.300 --> 01:20:20.500
Talked about the Material World Health Nutrition and fitness


1623
01:20:20.500 --> 01:20:23.400
now Fitness is is a


1624
01:20:23.400 --> 01:20:25.000
combination of Mars.


1625
01:20:25.700 --> 01:20:28.400
I'll just say I'll use signs Aries Leo


1626
01:20:28.400 --> 01:20:31.200
and Virgo so somebody who's really into fitness is


1627
01:20:31.200 --> 01:20:34.200
going to be combining those but it has to do with Fitness in


1628
01:20:34.200 --> 01:20:34.800
the term of


1629
01:20:36.200 --> 01:20:39.300
health and strategy to have health and


1630
01:20:39.300 --> 01:20:42.700
being able to do something on a daily basis. So if you see Virgo


1631
01:20:42.700 --> 01:20:45.000
here, like if you see Venus in the sixth house,


1632
01:20:45.300 --> 01:20:48.600
it's somebody who has to watch their diet watch their food live eat


1633
01:20:48.600 --> 01:20:51.800
a more structured diet so that they live a


1634
01:20:51.800 --> 01:20:54.600
better life because food will impact their health, which


1635
01:20:54.600 --> 01:20:57.400
is why nutrition is also a part especially once Venus gets


1636
01:20:57.400 --> 01:21:00.100
in there doubles, but Health Nutrition and fitness all of that


1637
01:21:00.100 --> 01:21:03.400
and when you're talking about jobs if somebody is Virgo in


1638
01:21:03.400 --> 01:21:06.400
the sixth house 10th house, whatever. This is an aspect


1639
01:21:06.400 --> 01:21:08.100
of what they're doing or could be an aspect.


1640
01:21:09.100 --> 01:21:12.400
And then organization and detailed they are meticulous. They


1641
01:21:12.400 --> 01:21:15.700
can be extremely critical and when Virgo like Virgo


1642
01:21:15.700 --> 01:21:18.600
Rising especially but Virgo Sun Virgo anything can be


1643
01:21:18.600 --> 01:21:21.600
extremely self-critical and these people can like


1644
01:21:21.600 --> 01:21:24.600
break themselves down detail by detail by


1645
01:21:24.600 --> 01:21:28.600
detail until there's almost nothing left. They've disseminated everything.


1646
01:21:29.800 --> 01:21:32.800
And and then


1647
01:21:32.800 --> 01:21:35.100
they organize it they compartmentalize they say


1648
01:21:35.100 --> 01:21:39.200
this these are the receptionists. These are the secretaries. These are the schedulers.


1649
01:21:38.200 --> 01:21:41.600
When you see this a lot of people who have Virgo


1650
01:21:41.600 --> 01:21:44.000
and know like Capricorn or Mars or anything


1651
01:21:44.100 --> 01:21:45.100
like that who are in


1652
01:21:47.100 --> 01:21:51.200
health like the health filter and medical field they end up being RNs


1653
01:21:50.200 --> 01:21:53.100
because it is attention to


1654
01:21:53.100 --> 01:21:57.100
detail organizing the day-to-day thing the actual job when


1655
01:21:56.100 --> 01:22:01.200
they bring in more authoritarian energies


1656
01:21:59.200 --> 01:22:02.700
in that's where they become hospital


1657
01:22:02.700 --> 01:22:04.600
administrator with like Gemini energy or


1658
01:22:06.500 --> 01:22:09.000
Surgeon, if they have Uranus in there, you know,


1659
01:22:09.300 --> 01:22:12.300
there's other or and and Jupiter but when


1660
01:22:12.300 --> 01:22:15.600
it's without that it's more of the lower level Your Daily


1661
01:22:15.600 --> 01:22:19.200
Grind. These are entry-level employees. Literally


1662
01:22:18.200 --> 01:22:21.100
your employee that person it works


1663
01:22:21.100 --> 01:22:24.200
it at that served you when you went out to eat. That was


1664
01:22:24.200 --> 01:22:27.200
a Virgo somewhere in their chart was Virgo or Taurus but


1665
01:22:27.200 --> 01:22:28.800
likely Virgo or combination.


1666
01:22:35.600 --> 01:22:38.800
Your Gemini mother and you butthead so that makes


1667
01:22:38.800 --> 01:22:39.500
sense Virgo.


1668
01:22:42.200 --> 01:22:45.700
How you out laurianne says how you so how


1669
01:22:45.700 --> 01:22:48.000
you outwardly present is Leo. It is


1670
01:22:48.100 --> 01:22:49.400
the first house and Leo.


1671
01:22:50.200 --> 01:22:54.300
Is your first house is your actions Leo is your


1672
01:22:53.300 --> 01:22:56.500
personality. It's the flavor. It's


1673
01:22:56.500 --> 01:22:59.600
the Flair. It's the drama that you put out there. You're creative


1674
01:22:59.600 --> 01:23:00.200
expression.


1675
01:23:01.200 --> 01:23:03.400
So it's a combination of Aries and Leo.


1676
01:23:04.900 --> 01:23:08.000
A lot of things in life are not one planet by


1677
01:23:07.400 --> 01:23:10.500
themselves by the way or one position by themselves.


1678
01:23:12.500 --> 01:23:15.700
Let me close these real quick. A lot of them. They they


1679
01:23:15.700 --> 01:23:16.300
Co-op.


1680
01:23:20.200 --> 01:23:21.600
All right Sue back over here.


1681
01:23:22.800 --> 01:23:25.700
Getting into Libra. Oh, yeah,


1682
01:23:25.700 --> 01:23:28.600
and Virgo is the six twelfth house access the


1683
01:23:28.600 --> 01:23:30.500
real world versus the spiritual world.


1684
01:23:31.500 --> 01:23:34.200
seventh remember we talked about 1/7 as an


1685
01:23:34.200 --> 01:23:35.600
axis 1 7


1686
01:23:36.200 --> 01:23:36.500
is


1687
01:23:38.200 --> 01:23:41.600
is you versus Partners Venus is


1688
01:23:41.600 --> 01:23:44.400
the ruler Libra is the glyph is the sign


1689
01:23:44.400 --> 01:23:47.300
and Partnerships in the seventh house these all go


1690
01:23:47.300 --> 01:23:48.800
together. So when we go into


1691
01:23:50.400 --> 01:23:53.200
What Libra is here again? We're back to an air


1692
01:23:53.200 --> 01:23:55.600
sign. It's a cardinal sign. This is where you start.


1693
01:23:58.500 --> 01:24:01.400
Fall I almost said winter. I was like, it's not winter. This is


1694
01:24:01.400 --> 01:24:04.500
where you start fall or Autumn is the Cardinal sign. It's


1695
01:24:04.500 --> 01:24:07.300
the first sign for that that time


1696
01:24:07.300 --> 01:24:07.800
period here.


1697
01:24:08.800 --> 01:24:11.300
It's an air sign. This has to do with logic it


1698
01:24:11.300 --> 01:24:14.000
has to do with the brain. It has


1699
01:24:14.100 --> 01:24:18.600
to do with communication. So everything you're talking about here. It


1700
01:24:17.600 --> 01:24:20.100
relies on communication, but it's


1701
01:24:20.100 --> 01:24:23.200
the Ethereal or not ethereal, but


1702
01:24:23.200 --> 01:24:26.600
the the eloquent elegant eloquent


1703
01:24:26.600 --> 01:24:30.100
side of the air symbols. This


1704
01:24:29.100 --> 01:24:32.000
is why it well I get in the second.


1705
01:24:32.400 --> 01:24:35.500
This is the glyph again Venus again. Same


1706
01:24:35.500 --> 01:24:38.600
thing as mercury whenever you see Taurus you see Libra when


1707
01:24:38.600 --> 01:24:41.200
you're talking about Venus you just put them together and it could


1708
01:24:41.200 --> 01:24:44.300
mean anything from those two signs. We could be talking about food or we


1709
01:24:44.300 --> 01:24:46.400
could be talking about fashion and design


1710
01:24:47.400 --> 01:24:50.500
so it's not separated when it's the glyph but when


1711
01:24:50.500 --> 01:24:52.300
it is the sign it is separated.


1712
01:24:53.400 --> 01:24:56.400
Relationships in marriage it's the house of partnership. So


1713
01:24:56.400 --> 01:24:59.200
it makes sense that the main thing most people


1714
01:24:59.200 --> 01:25:02.400
look at the seventh house is is relationships and marriage. What's


1715
01:25:02.400 --> 01:25:05.400
unfortunate is the seventh House of all


1716
01:25:05.400 --> 01:25:09.200
the houses and I make change this once I get through 12, but


1717
01:25:08.200 --> 01:25:11.800
the seventh house seems to be the one that people


1718
01:25:11.800 --> 01:25:15.000
only associate to relationships in


1719
01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:15.200
marriage.


1720
01:25:15.900 --> 01:25:18.600
When you know when I was talking about the fifth


1721
01:25:18.600 --> 01:25:19.800
house here Leo.


1722
01:25:21.200 --> 01:25:25.300
This was pleasure when we talked about what Leo is it was romance. So


1723
01:25:24.300 --> 01:25:26.800
when you talk about love and you're talking about


1724
01:25:27.800 --> 01:25:29.000
relationships


1725
01:25:30.100 --> 01:25:33.300
We're talking about the actual Union. We're talking about


1726
01:25:33.300 --> 01:25:37.100
the actual. How do you interact with the other person the actual relationship?


1727
01:25:36.100 --> 01:25:40.100
We are not talking about the actual Romance


1728
01:25:39.100 --> 01:25:42.500
of it. That's Leo. So a lot


1729
01:25:42.500 --> 01:25:45.400
of topics are split in between different houses different


1730
01:25:45.400 --> 01:25:48.300
size different planets, and I think that's important to understand.


1731
01:25:48.300 --> 01:25:51.500
I know that's important to understand because once you start reading it you realize that


1732
01:25:51.500 --> 01:25:54.000
the seventh house is the relationship. The fifth house


1733
01:25:54.300 --> 01:25:58.000
is Romance the 8th house is intimacy. The third house is communication. You


1734
01:25:57.300 --> 01:26:00.900
start pulling all this together to create the real essence


1735
01:26:00.900 --> 01:26:03.800
of the relationship, but the union itself.


1736
01:26:05.300 --> 01:26:08.400
Is you know in the seventh house? This is one-on-one. This


1737
01:26:08.400 --> 01:26:11.300
is the opposite of self. It is U plus other


1738
01:26:11.300 --> 01:26:14.400
people. That's what the house actually represents you


1739
01:26:14.400 --> 01:26:15.000
plus.


1740
01:26:16.100 --> 01:26:19.400
Others not in a group session, but


1741
01:26:19.400 --> 01:26:23.300
you versus one it's one-on-one. And ironically


1742
01:26:22.300 --> 01:26:25.300
it can be I put it this way


1743
01:26:25.300 --> 01:26:28.600
because I talk about it could be the public. It's not your Public Image.


1744
01:26:28.600 --> 01:26:31.400
It is not public speaking it is


1745
01:26:31.400 --> 01:26:34.100
or can be but if Mercury is there


1746
01:26:34.100 --> 01:26:37.900
but it is not where you're seeing. It's where you're talking specifically to


1747
01:26:37.900 --> 01:26:39.500
them stand up comics.


1748
01:26:40.500 --> 01:26:43.400
For instance. They are one person speaking to


1749
01:26:43.400 --> 01:26:46.800
the public as one even in their sets.


1750
01:26:46.800 --> 01:26:49.700
They've usually pick somebody out of the crowd because


1751
01:26:49.700 --> 01:26:52.200
they're not talking to a group of people. Usually they're talking to one


1752
01:26:52.200 --> 01:26:55.100
one and then when they're telling their jokes, they're telling to all of


1753
01:26:55.100 --> 01:26:58.200
you at the same time that entity that group of body is


1754
01:26:58.200 --> 01:27:01.200
one so that is one to one. So whenever we talk about the


1755
01:27:01.200 --> 01:27:04.700
public we're talking about you versus how you


1756
01:27:04.700 --> 01:27:06.700
interact with the public as a whole.


1757
01:27:08.100 --> 01:27:10.100
As if the public was one person.


1758
01:27:11.100 --> 01:27:14.000
Or we can just narrow it down to 101 now. It does have to


1759
01:27:14.100 --> 01:27:17.400
do with relationships in marriage, but also has to do with partnership and


1760
01:27:17.400 --> 01:27:20.300
business. I do a lot a lot a lot


1761
01:27:20.300 --> 01:27:23.800
of business readings and you notice that the symbol is the scales.


1762
01:27:23.800 --> 01:27:26.300
It's legal. It actually deals


1763
01:27:26.300 --> 01:27:29.700
with legalities, which is why when I'm looking at your chart, I'm


1764
01:27:29.700 --> 01:27:31.500
looking at the axis here.


1765
01:27:32.500 --> 01:27:36.400
Where to go do do boom. I'm


1766
01:27:35.400 --> 01:27:38.800
looking at the axis here of you


1767
01:27:38.800 --> 01:27:42.200
starting your own business. That's why


1768
01:27:41.200 --> 01:27:44.000
I'm always looking at the seventh house when I'm doing


1769
01:27:44.400 --> 01:27:47.700
those readings if you've caught some of my lives or some of my readings has to


1770
01:27:47.700 --> 01:27:51.500
do with your own business how your business is going to be business Partnerships


1771
01:27:50.500 --> 01:27:53.300
The Entity itself, which


1772
01:27:53.300 --> 01:27:54.800
is you and The Business.


1773
01:27:56.900 --> 01:27:59.300
Because you are the owner of the business.


1774
01:27:59.300 --> 01:28:00.400
It's you plus the business.


1775
01:28:01.400 --> 01:28:04.600
On conversely or on another tangent Here


1776
01:28:04.600 --> 01:28:07.400
style fashion and design so people


1777
01:28:07.400 --> 01:28:11.100
who do like interior design. They're in the fashion industry. They


1778
01:28:10.100 --> 01:28:13.800
Design Homes they design anything you


1779
01:28:13.800 --> 01:28:16.300
could people who are into CAD who are


1780
01:28:16.300 --> 01:28:19.600
you know designing anything that is Libra energy. It's


1781
01:28:19.600 --> 01:28:22.400
different than Taurus energy. Taurus is the Arts. It's


1782
01:28:22.400 --> 01:28:25.100
the tangible Arts. It's the because it's an earth sign. You can


1783
01:28:25.100 --> 01:28:28.300
actually touch it. This is air sign. This


1784
01:28:28.300 --> 01:28:31.300
has to do with your using your mind to


1785
01:28:31.300 --> 01:28:34.300
create that's the design aspect. You're actually


1786
01:28:34.300 --> 01:28:37.400
writing you're drawing it. You're putting it together. You're moving


1787
01:28:37.400 --> 01:28:41.000
things around you're using your brain to logically create


1788
01:28:40.500 --> 01:28:42.400
something of structure.


1789
01:28:43.500 --> 01:28:45.200
And that is the design here.


1790
01:28:47.800 --> 01:28:51.100
Seventh is not colleagues Julie you


1791
01:28:50.100 --> 01:28:53.300
said how is the third house colleagues versus the


1792
01:28:53.300 --> 01:28:55.600
seventh the third house is


1793
01:28:56.900 --> 01:28:59.300
Coworkers the sixth house


1794
01:28:59.300 --> 01:29:02.500
is employees. The seventh house is your business meaning


1795
01:29:02.500 --> 01:29:05.400
the actual business. Not anyone who's


1796
01:29:05.400 --> 01:29:07.900
in it or Business Partnership meaning?


1797
01:29:08.900 --> 01:29:11.200
I own part of the business. They own part of the business.


1798
01:29:11.200 --> 01:29:14.300
They're not employees. They're not co-workers. We both


1799
01:29:14.300 --> 01:29:16.100
have a legal stake in this company.


1800
01:29:17.500 --> 01:29:19.700
That's the difference is the legal aspect of it.


1801
01:29:24.500 --> 01:29:28.700
Let me clear those out real quick. Boom cool. And I'm


1802
01:29:28.700 --> 01:29:31.400
glad you guys are asking these questions because it is helping me clarify


1803
01:29:31.400 --> 01:29:34.900
some in this there's a wealth of information and to


1804
01:29:34.900 --> 01:29:37.200
fit this in two hours has already been a struggle which is why I'm


1805
01:29:37.200 --> 01:29:38.500
I'm keeping it moving here.


1806
01:29:39.100 --> 01:29:42.300
Let's go into the eighth house here. So now we're talking about Scorpio one


1807
01:29:42.300 --> 01:29:44.400
of the most misunderstood.


1808
01:29:45.200 --> 01:29:49.100
Areas of life signs planets in history


1809
01:29:48.100 --> 01:29:51.500
every single time someone talks


1810
01:29:51.500 --> 01:29:54.800
about Pluto like 99.9999% of


1811
01:29:54.800 --> 01:29:57.400
times. They are missing 99% of


1812
01:29:57.400 --> 01:30:00.600
what Scorpio actually embodies and I could go on forever


1813
01:30:00.600 --> 01:30:03.900
Scorpio is so deep and it literally means depths


1814
01:30:04.400 --> 01:30:07.500
This when you see it the eighth house


1815
01:30:07.500 --> 01:30:10.100
here, which is ruled by Pluto. And this is the symbol it's all about


1816
01:30:10.100 --> 01:30:14.200
transformation and so much more even the


1817
01:30:14.200 --> 01:30:17.300
planet Scorpio and I'll talk about that in a


1818
01:30:17.300 --> 01:30:20.200
second. But this is the glyph this is another glyph you'll


1819
01:30:20.200 --> 01:30:23.300
also see Pluto represented this way as the ruler of


1820
01:30:23.300 --> 01:30:27.300
the underworld. This is what it looks like when astro.com


1821
01:30:26.300 --> 01:30:29.200
it looks like this but they actually use both of


1822
01:30:29.200 --> 01:30:32.500
these glyphs. I'm pretty sure they use this one so that


1823
01:30:32.500 --> 01:30:35.300
this doesn't get confused with some of these other ones in there. So


1824
01:30:35.300 --> 01:30:37.800
P Pluto whatever it also is power.


1825
01:30:38.600 --> 01:30:41.600
Power transformation manifestation the past so


1826
01:30:41.600 --> 01:30:44.700
that P can help you and also the Phoenix


1827
01:30:44.700 --> 01:30:45.900
P for Phoenix.


1828
01:30:47.600 --> 01:30:50.300
So this house oh my goodness. They miss so much with


1829
01:30:50.300 --> 01:30:54.200
Scorpio and I love Scorpio energy because


1830
01:30:53.200 --> 01:30:56.300
it literally rules the occult, which


1831
01:30:56.300 --> 01:30:59.200
is something I didn't put on here, but I'm gonna dive into that.


1832
01:30:59.200 --> 01:31:02.600
It rules the occult. It rules anything. That is Taboo in


1833
01:31:02.600 --> 01:31:05.500
general anything that is society doesn't


1834
01:31:05.500 --> 01:31:08.300
understand doesn't accept it's kind


1835
01:31:08.300 --> 01:31:10.500
of out there and it's like people might think it's weird.


1836
01:31:11.600 --> 01:31:14.100
That's Scorpio. So it is


1837
01:31:14.100 --> 01:31:16.600
ruled by Pluto again. The p is the other one.


1838
01:31:17.600 --> 01:31:20.700
It's the Scorpion obviously and


1839
01:31:21.700 --> 01:31:24.300
this is the the glyph that you'll see for the


1840
01:31:24.300 --> 01:31:25.500
sign of Scorpio.


1841
01:31:26.500 --> 01:31:29.100
Earlier today. I went out and got a burger and I


1842
01:31:29.100 --> 01:31:32.400
went to Cinco gentlemen or five


1843
01:31:32.400 --> 01:31:35.500
guys and I got a burger with three patties.


1844
01:31:35.500 --> 01:31:38.200
It was enjoying it and I'm thinking about this class and I'm thinking about


1845
01:31:38.200 --> 01:31:41.100
my hopes and dreams which is Aquarian and what


1846
01:31:41.100 --> 01:31:44.700
I really want out of this which is transformation. I want to transform


1847
01:31:45.900 --> 01:31:48.300
astrology in the stigma and kind of


1848
01:31:48.300 --> 01:31:49.600
put this out there so that


1849
01:31:50.400 --> 01:31:54.000
It becomes more normalized and less taboo pop


1850
01:31:53.300 --> 01:31:56.600
culture astrology. Let's get rid of that. Let's teach


1851
01:31:56.600 --> 01:31:59.100
the good stuff because this is what it's all about.


1852
01:31:59.100 --> 01:32:02.300
You being able to live your best life you understanding all


1853
01:32:02.300 --> 01:32:05.500
this so that you can actually do amazing things


1854
01:32:05.500 --> 01:32:08.800
with your life and people like how did you do that? And whether


1855
01:32:08.800 --> 01:32:11.500
you tell them or not it's up to you. But the answer is


1856
01:32:11.500 --> 01:32:14.600
I use Divine timing. I used what


1857
01:32:14.600 --> 01:32:16.200
I already had which was energy.


1858
01:32:16.900 --> 01:32:19.100
Scorpio is transitioned now while I was out.


1859
01:32:19.800 --> 01:32:22.500
On the radio. I truly believe


1860
01:32:22.500 --> 01:32:25.400
by the way that what I'm doing right now and what you're


1861
01:32:25.400 --> 01:32:28.300
going to do when you take this some of you astrologers some of


1862
01:32:28.300 --> 01:32:32.100
you guys who are going to learn other things is I'm planting the seed to Blossom


1863
01:32:31.100 --> 01:32:34.700
so many amazing spiritual healers


1864
01:32:34.700 --> 01:32:34.800
out there.


1865
01:32:35.600 --> 01:32:38.000
My wife as well a lot of a lot of you


1866
01:32:38.100 --> 01:32:41.000
guys are going to end up doing the same thing and it's gonna Network and spawn out


1867
01:32:41.300 --> 01:32:44.900
and I believe this is going to bring us to the age of Aquarius which co-rules


1868
01:32:44.900 --> 01:32:47.100
astrology and this is why I think


1869
01:32:47.100 --> 01:32:50.000
this is so important and spirit is always listening.


1870
01:32:51.200 --> 01:32:54.200
And while I was eating my burger a song


1871
01:32:54.200 --> 01:32:57.900
by The Scorpions Scorpio scorpions called Wind


1872
01:32:57.900 --> 01:33:00.200
of Change. Most of you probably know it. It's an older


1873
01:33:00.200 --> 01:33:03.100
song most you probably know it came on which has to do with


1874
01:33:03.100 --> 01:33:06.800
all of this stuff change Evolution, you know processing everything


1875
01:33:06.800 --> 01:33:09.600
and my wife says the winds


1876
01:33:09.600 --> 01:33:12.300
it's the Winds of Change when it's Breezy outside and it's like hitting pretty


1877
01:33:12.300 --> 01:33:15.100
hard. She always says that because that's what we are hoping to


1878
01:33:15.100 --> 01:33:16.100
do anyway,


1879
01:33:17.200 --> 01:33:21.800
It is a fixed sign which is interesting because it's


1880
01:33:20.800 --> 01:33:23.300
a contradiction because it is about


1881
01:33:23.300 --> 01:33:26.100
change but it's stuck change. It's also about


1882
01:33:26.100 --> 01:33:29.800
Cycles which I don't have here but is also about Cycles. It's


1883
01:33:29.800 --> 01:33:32.700
about repeating the same cycles and things that are toxic


1884
01:33:32.700 --> 01:33:35.500
and you have to be careful because Pluto energy


1885
01:33:35.500 --> 01:33:39.000
is about upheaval. It's about things that are chaos and


1886
01:33:38.500 --> 01:33:42.000
Mayhem and it's the underworld and upheaval


1887
01:33:41.100 --> 01:33:44.200
and things that are so deep down that you've repressed them


1888
01:33:44.200 --> 01:33:47.700
and you don't deal with them people who are psychologists have


1889
01:33:47.700 --> 01:33:50.600
Scorpio Eighth House or Pluto placements


1890
01:33:50.600 --> 01:33:53.300
there the people who like to dig deep and obsess over


1891
01:33:53.300 --> 01:33:56.600
things Pluto Scorpio Eighth House deep bonds


1892
01:33:56.600 --> 01:33:59.800
though. That's the positive you can have very deep bonds


1893
01:33:59.800 --> 01:34:02.100
with somebody who has Pluto it


1894
01:34:02.100 --> 01:34:05.300
can and also often if you use the energy, right? It can


1895
01:34:05.300 --> 01:34:06.900
evolve my mother.


1896
01:34:07.800 --> 01:34:10.000
and I oops that's not the right


1897
01:34:10.200 --> 01:34:13.300
one my mother and I you know, you see


1898
01:34:13.300 --> 01:34:16.100
Jupiter here in Scorpio and then Pluto like I had a


1899
01:34:16.100 --> 01:34:19.000
very abusive childhood which obviously I'm not going to get into in a class,


1900
01:34:19.200 --> 01:34:22.200
but that was my upbringing and obviously the people who have gone


1901
01:34:22.200 --> 01:34:25.200
through abuse tend to understand abuse, they understand pain and


1902
01:34:25.200 --> 01:34:27.700
they become healers many of them if they elevate


1903
01:34:28.600 --> 01:34:31.400
But now I have


1904
01:34:31.400 --> 01:34:34.200
such an amazing deep bond with My


1905
01:34:34.200 --> 01:34:37.400
adoptive mother conversely Pluto is


1906
01:34:37.400 --> 01:34:40.100
about endings too and cutting people off. I cut off


1907
01:34:40.100 --> 01:34:43.200
both my blood sister and my birth mother a very long to actually


1908
01:34:43.200 --> 01:34:46.300
right around 24 years old. That's when it happened. I


1909
01:34:47.400 --> 01:34:50.300
I was 24. That's the that's when it happened. I cut


1910
01:34:50.300 --> 01:34:51.700
them off and said you know it no more.


1911
01:34:52.400 --> 01:34:55.600
I'm done, and I'm not gonna get into the story here on my


1912
01:34:55.600 --> 01:34:56.800
podcast. I'll talk about it.


1913
01:34:57.600 --> 01:35:00.500
But you know, this is it was


1914
01:35:00.500 --> 01:35:03.500
chaos and Mayhem and my mother and I had such a tumultuous relationship


1915
01:35:03.500 --> 01:35:06.300
my adopted mother and I love her to death, but we


1916
01:35:06.300 --> 01:35:07.400
just couldn't get it together.


1917
01:35:08.300 --> 01:35:11.800
And now we're older and


1918
01:35:11.800 --> 01:35:15.000
obviously, you know non astrologically speaking


1919
01:35:14.600 --> 01:35:17.400
Time Heals wounds you grow you


1920
01:35:17.400 --> 01:35:20.700
evolve you gain wisdom so on and so forth, but and Jupiter


1921
01:35:20.700 --> 01:35:23.500
does rule wisdom and experience and that did help obviously,


1922
01:35:23.500 --> 01:35:26.500
but Jupiter's also about expansion. We have


1923
01:35:26.500 --> 01:35:29.400
an amazing Bond we go and it's also


1924
01:35:29.400 --> 01:35:32.700
about things that are hidden my mother and I don't talk that much but


1925
01:35:32.700 --> 01:35:33.900
when we do talk, it's just like


1926
01:35:34.900 --> 01:35:37.600
You know like we spoke two hours ago. It


1927
01:35:37.600 --> 01:35:40.600
just it's such an interesting set of


1928
01:35:40.600 --> 01:35:41.200
energies here.


1929
01:35:42.300 --> 01:35:45.200
But it also rules Obsession and manipulation when you're talking


1930
01:35:45.200 --> 01:35:48.300
about love and doing love readings. You have to be very careful about


1931
01:35:48.300 --> 01:35:51.800
manipulation Obsession toxic traits toxic


1932
01:35:51.800 --> 01:35:54.200
Cycles people from the past that you can't let go


1933
01:35:54.200 --> 01:35:57.400
of that kind of energy. It also rules shared resources,


1934
01:35:57.400 --> 01:36:00.500
which is right after the seventh House of partnership. The eighth house


1935
01:36:00.500 --> 01:36:02.000
is both business and


1936
01:36:04.100 --> 01:36:07.400
and marital shared assets and it's the


1937
01:36:07.400 --> 01:36:10.700
sign of using other people's stuff. So


1938
01:36:10.700 --> 01:36:13.100
if you have Pluto in the second house, most of your


1939
01:36:13.100 --> 01:36:16.300
belongings were either hand me downs or you just kind of take their


1940
01:36:16.300 --> 01:36:19.400
stuff and you use it as your own Pluto in the third house you


1941
01:36:19.400 --> 01:36:22.200
tend to take other people's ideas. I have it


1942
01:36:22.200 --> 01:36:25.400
here take other people's ideas and transform them


1943
01:36:25.400 --> 01:36:28.100
you take other people's ideas and make them your own


1944
01:36:28.100 --> 01:36:31.100
other people sayings my wife has this I have this we do


1945
01:36:31.100 --> 01:36:35.000
it all the time. We quote movie quotes like crazy. We


1946
01:36:34.200 --> 01:36:37.500
do it all the time. And we the way we deliver it


1947
01:36:37.500 --> 01:36:40.300
is almost like we invented it, but we know where it came


1948
01:36:40.300 --> 01:36:43.300
from and we know that the other person knows where it came from, but we make it


1949
01:36:43.300 --> 01:36:46.400
our own and sometimes with my Gemini energy. Sometimes I'll


1950
01:36:46.400 --> 01:36:47.200
just emulate it.


1951
01:36:47.800 --> 01:36:51.500
But that energy is there joint ventures


1952
01:36:51.500 --> 01:36:54.200
whenever you want to go into business with somebody it's the


1953
01:36:54.200 --> 01:36:55.900
assets of that joint venture.


1954
01:36:56.400 --> 01:36:59.400
Taxes inheritance again. This is other people's stuff


1955
01:36:59.400 --> 01:37:02.200
other people's money. This is money that you have to


1956
01:37:02.200 --> 01:37:05.500
that you owe it's also debt which I need to add in there. It's


1957
01:37:05.500 --> 01:37:08.800
debt taxes and inheritances regeneration. If


1958
01:37:08.800 --> 01:37:11.500
you have Pluto in the sixth house for instance your health will regenerate


1959
01:37:11.500 --> 01:37:14.800
if you have Pluto in the second house, you can regenerate


1960
01:37:14.800 --> 01:37:17.400
money if it's cyclical. You


1961
01:37:17.400 --> 01:37:20.400
can also lose that money and then it becomes this vicious cycle. That's


1962
01:37:20.400 --> 01:37:23.700
why it's very important to understand Pluto because Pluto literally


1963
01:37:23.700 --> 01:37:26.700
is your inner power. It's your personal power it


1964
01:37:26.700 --> 01:37:29.100
has to do with intimacy and love it has to do with


1965
01:37:29.100 --> 01:37:32.100
Secrets aspects of you that you keep hidden and you


1966
01:37:32.100 --> 01:37:32.900
don't show the world.


1967
01:37:34.300 --> 01:37:36.000
For very very deep reasons.


1968
01:37:37.100 --> 01:37:40.600
Rebirth and change. This is all about the cycle


1969
01:37:40.600 --> 01:37:42.400
bringing the past in.


1970
01:37:43.300 --> 01:37:46.200
Cycling it through and becoming someone else if you do


1971
01:37:46.200 --> 01:37:49.100
not become someone else it repeats the cycle and it


1972
01:37:49.100 --> 01:37:52.300
becomes very vicious. A lot of people blame Pluto in whatever house


1973
01:37:52.300 --> 01:37:55.500
for whatever ailment Pluto in the second house. I'll never


1974
01:37:55.500 --> 01:37:58.100
make money because Pluto is there in Pluto sucks is the


1975
01:37:58.100 --> 01:38:01.400
underworld chaos and Mayhem and turmoil. It is


1976
01:38:01.400 --> 01:38:04.200
naturally, but if you take it and you use


1977
01:38:04.200 --> 01:38:05.600
it Pluto is power.


1978
01:38:06.500 --> 01:38:09.400
How do you think we got to where we are here at Mystic


1979
01:38:09.400 --> 01:38:12.000
Rebels. We we use Pluto Pluto is


1980
01:38:12.400 --> 01:38:15.200
so vitally important, but I will get into that


1981
01:38:15.200 --> 01:38:17.000
through YouTube videos and whatnot.


1982
01:38:17.900 --> 01:38:20.300
Change on a slow level change on


1983
01:38:20.300 --> 01:38:23.900
a take everything from the inside and really transform and


1984
01:38:23.900 --> 01:38:26.600
become something that's more transformation than change. I


1985
01:38:26.600 --> 01:38:28.500
might have to reword that.


1986
01:38:29.300 --> 01:38:33.900
So that is Scorpio here remember joint stuff


1987
01:38:33.900 --> 01:38:35.400
your stuff?


1988
01:38:37.600 --> 01:38:39.700
All right, so ninth house.


1989
01:38:43.100 --> 01:38:46.600
Sure, you're talking about hypnosis hypnosis definitely uses


1990
01:38:46.600 --> 01:38:50.200
a combination of Neptune Pisces energy


1991
01:38:49.200 --> 01:38:52.300
and Scorpio energy once it's


1992
01:38:52.300 --> 01:38:52.700
slower.


1993
01:38:56.100 --> 01:38:59.300
It can it can become that but it has to do a transformation and


1994
01:38:59.300 --> 01:39:00.000
change.


1995
01:39:00.900 --> 01:39:03.300
Why do people say the Scorpio is


1996
01:39:03.300 --> 01:39:06.200
ruled by Mars? Ah amazing question. I thought about it earlier and


1997
01:39:06.200 --> 01:39:09.200
totally forgot this to speak on this when you're talking about people who


1998
01:39:09.200 --> 01:39:12.200
do what's called traditional astrology. They are


1999
01:39:12.200 --> 01:39:12.600
using


2000
01:39:13.800 --> 01:39:16.400
all of the planets as rulers up through


2001
01:39:16.400 --> 01:39:19.500
Saturn before the other three planets were


2002
01:39:19.500 --> 01:39:21.900
discovered Uranus Neptune in Pluto are fairly new.


2003
01:39:22.700 --> 01:39:25.500
And the interesting thing with Pluto, let me


2004
01:39:25.500 --> 01:39:28.100
go back since that's what we're talking about. The interesting thing with Pluto here


2005
01:39:28.100 --> 01:39:31.100
is Pluto is demoted to a dwarf planet.


2006
01:39:31.100 --> 01:39:34.300
Then it was a planet again that it was not a planet then they


2007
01:39:34.300 --> 01:39:37.200
weren't sure if it was in the solar system then it because they couldn't


2008
01:39:37.200 --> 01:39:40.400
find it for a minute. Then it came back and then they demoted it


2009
01:39:40.400 --> 01:39:43.300
back down. And now I think it's still a divorce Planet. They keep


2010
01:39:43.300 --> 01:39:47.400
changing it right Scorpio change transformation. The


2011
01:39:46.400 --> 01:39:49.200
reason that it's a dwarf planet


2012
01:39:49.200 --> 01:39:53.100
is because unlike every other planet it exists with


2013
01:39:52.100 --> 01:39:55.500
all the space dust and debris around it


2014
01:39:55.500 --> 01:39:58.400
instead of absorbing it into the planet and becoming


2015
01:39:58.400 --> 01:39:58.800
larger.


2016
01:39:59.700 --> 01:40:01.100
Well what Scorpio rule?


2017
01:40:01.900 --> 01:40:03.000
shared assets


2018
01:40:04.300 --> 01:40:07.400
Where is it right there shared resources. It doesn't absorb it


2019
01:40:07.400 --> 01:40:10.900
in. It just lives among it and it's there everything that


2020
01:40:10.900 --> 01:40:14.600
has happened with the planet Pluto literally embodies


2021
01:40:13.600 --> 01:40:16.900
Scorpio energy, and I find that extremely fascinating.


2022
01:40:17.800 --> 01:40:20.200
But a lot of astrologers say Mars because before we


2023
01:40:20.200 --> 01:40:23.600
discovered Pluto, the ruler was Mars Mars co-ruled Aries


2024
01:40:23.600 --> 01:40:25.900
and co-ruled Scorpio now.


2025
01:40:26.900 --> 01:40:29.500
I have huge issue with that and it's


2026
01:40:29.500 --> 01:40:32.500
going to be the same thing with the last three planets. It's going


2027
01:40:32.500 --> 01:40:35.600
to be or not three plants three signs. It's going to be Scorpio. It's


2028
01:40:35.600 --> 01:40:38.400
going to be Aquarius and then Pisces


2029
01:40:38.400 --> 01:40:42.600
they all have different co-rulers Scorpio was


2030
01:40:41.600 --> 01:40:44.300
Mars. Now the problem that


2031
01:40:44.300 --> 01:40:47.400
I have this isn't helping. Let me go back over here. The problem that


2032
01:40:47.400 --> 01:40:50.300
I have with Mars ruling Scorpio is


2033
01:40:50.300 --> 01:40:53.100
that Scorpio's themes all have to do with


2034
01:40:53.100 --> 01:40:56.200
things that are extremely deep inside they have


2035
01:40:56.200 --> 01:40:59.600
to do with change they have to do with transformation. And yes, it's


2036
01:40:59.600 --> 01:41:02.900
Pluto does rule rage, right so


2037
01:41:02.900 --> 01:41:05.300
I can see why people think that Mars rules


2038
01:41:05.300 --> 01:41:08.700
it because the in our minds the excess


2039
01:41:09.600 --> 01:41:12.300
the most excessive extreme of Mars would


2040
01:41:12.300 --> 01:41:16.000
be rage but rage is not excessive anger


2041
01:41:15.900 --> 01:41:18.400
rage is a display of


2042
01:41:18.400 --> 01:41:22.000
inner turmoil that comes about often in


2043
01:41:21.400 --> 01:41:23.900
a way that you don't know where it came from.


2044
01:41:24.700 --> 01:41:27.500
It just comes out of nowhere. It is explosive. It


2045
01:41:27.500 --> 01:41:30.100
is Carnage and that is Pluto.


2046
01:41:30.600 --> 01:41:33.200
But it's not outward. It's not obvious. It's not


2047
01:41:33.200 --> 01:41:36.500
like oh, they're getting angry. It's like where the did


2048
01:41:36.500 --> 01:41:39.400
that come from and it's just is out on display.


2049
01:41:39.400 --> 01:41:42.300
It doesn't match. It doesn't


2050
01:41:42.300 --> 01:41:46.000
match the physical body. Scorpio is extremely internalized.


2051
01:41:45.100 --> 01:41:49.800
It is sharing other people's stuff and Mars


2052
01:41:48.800 --> 01:41:52.200
is all about me. Selfish extremely


2053
01:41:51.200 --> 01:41:55.500
about me self-centered egotistical


2054
01:41:54.500 --> 01:41:57.600
in in a very different way than Leo


2055
01:41:57.600 --> 01:42:00.300
just just selfish right? It's not


2056
01:42:00.300 --> 01:42:03.500
about Pride. It's just about no, it's mine mine mine


2057
01:42:03.500 --> 01:42:06.600
mine. All me Scorpio is about this is ours


2058
01:42:06.600 --> 01:42:09.200
and there's an element of this is ours, but I'm gonna


2059
01:42:09.200 --> 01:42:12.600
take this because it's ours I can take it whenever I want but that's


2060
01:42:12.600 --> 01:42:15.500
the opposite and that's why I have a problem with Mars is


2061
01:42:15.500 --> 01:42:18.500
the rule. I do not use traditional. I do use modern


2062
01:42:18.500 --> 01:42:19.400
rulership.


2063
01:42:20.100 --> 01:42:23.500
I don't believe that there are two planets that rule one sign


2064
01:42:23.500 --> 01:42:26.600
because I for the reasons I just explained the


2065
01:42:26.600 --> 01:42:30.000
other planet doesn't make any sense. And this is also it's


2066
01:42:29.300 --> 01:42:31.100
a great question because


2067
01:42:33.300 --> 01:42:36.800
it's a great question because it's important to understand that we


2068
01:42:36.800 --> 01:42:39.800
do not age a Pisces era of Pisces now


2069
01:42:39.800 --> 01:42:42.500
phase of cancer and and that'll


2070
01:42:42.500 --> 01:42:45.400
be in a you in more YouTube videos that I'll talk about this the ages


2071
01:42:45.400 --> 01:42:47.200
and how we calculate that and everything but


2072
01:42:47.900 --> 01:42:50.900
We do not understand much and that's


2073
01:42:50.900 --> 01:42:53.400
what Pisces is all about. We don't know that much


2074
01:42:53.400 --> 01:42:56.400
in in the grand scheme of things. We're we're lost. We're in a


2075
01:42:56.400 --> 01:42:57.200
haze. We're trying to figure it out.


2076
01:42:58.100 --> 01:43:01.200
We have to have these spiritual beliefs spiritual beliefs are


2077
01:43:01.200 --> 01:43:04.500
great, but we kind of need to believe that something because we don't know everything.


2078
01:43:05.600 --> 01:43:05.800
and


2079
01:43:09.500 --> 01:43:12.100
Once you take all of this knowledge and you move it forward


2080
01:43:12.100 --> 01:43:15.900
and you're able to find new things there


2081
01:43:15.900 --> 01:43:18.400
will be discoveries in technique in you


2082
01:43:18.400 --> 01:43:21.000
know, astronomers are gonna find planets astrologers are going to


2083
01:43:21.200 --> 01:43:24.200
convert them into how they seem to affect as they trans it


2084
01:43:24.200 --> 01:43:27.200
by we don't know everything no textbook knows everything.


2085
01:43:27.200 --> 01:43:30.800
I don't know everything. I'm teaching what I do know over many


2086
01:43:30.800 --> 01:43:33.300
years of Obsessed Obsession literally.


2087
01:43:35.300 --> 01:43:38.300
obsessing on a very personal level my


2088
01:43:38.300 --> 01:43:41.900
IC which might be a next class about


2089
01:43:42.900 --> 01:43:45.800
You know things that are extremely personal to me at home,


2090
01:43:45.800 --> 01:43:48.600
which is where I did most of this and it's taboo stuff


2091
01:43:48.600 --> 01:43:51.400
which astrology is a part of the occult as what I


2092
01:43:51.400 --> 01:43:51.400
did.


2093
01:43:52.600 --> 01:43:55.500
And that's this is also because it spills into Libra's energy.


2094
01:43:55.500 --> 01:43:58.500
This is why I found people in public and just kept trying


2095
01:43:58.500 --> 01:43:59.300
kept trying.


2096
01:44:00.200 --> 01:44:03.500
And kept doing it and working working over and over and kept transforming how


2097
01:44:03.500 --> 01:44:07.100
I believed how I thought how I learned. This


2098
01:44:06.100 --> 01:44:08.900
is why I learned the way I learned.


2099
01:44:10.100 --> 01:44:11.600
But we'll get into that in another time.


2100
01:44:12.600 --> 01:44:13.800
Sagittarius here


2101
01:44:14.700 --> 01:44:17.300
Pluto is absolutely power. You can see it as power


2102
01:44:17.300 --> 01:44:18.500
struggles with people as well.


2103
01:44:20.600 --> 01:44:23.500
Taylor that was Taylor's question if someone has a lot of Scorpio


2104
01:44:23.500 --> 01:44:26.500
would you say there a OCD? No, that is more Virgo.


2105
01:44:27.100 --> 01:44:31.500
Scorpio is more private about everything's Virgo


2106
01:44:30.500 --> 01:44:33.500
because they need structure and


2107
01:44:33.500 --> 01:44:36.600
organization need everything to be where it needs to be. That's Virgo.


2108
01:44:37.800 --> 01:44:39.700
It's very Mercurial energy here.


2109
01:44:42.500 --> 01:44:45.100
Answered that one I heard Pluto is where you try


2110
01:44:45.100 --> 01:44:48.500
to claim your power and can maybe relate to power dynamics. Yep.


2111
01:44:50.300 --> 01:44:53.500
Pluto is all about power and again when I


2112
01:44:53.500 --> 01:44:56.300
tell when I have clients, I always go


2113
01:44:56.300 --> 01:44:59.300
to Pluto Chiron in the moon. Those are the three main things


2114
01:44:59.300 --> 01:45:02.700
and we'll talk about those separately in future classes


2115
01:45:02.700 --> 01:45:05.100
those three once we get


2116
01:45:05.100 --> 01:45:08.400
into the actual what you can do with them. You can change your


2117
01:45:08.400 --> 01:45:11.300
entire existence and literally like become a


2118
01:45:11.300 --> 01:45:14.500
different person living a different life by honing in on that.


2119
01:45:16.700 --> 01:45:19.100
Sagittarius is all about Higher Learning.


2120
01:45:19.100 --> 01:45:22.300
It's the ruler of the ninth House Ninth house ruled by


2121
01:45:22.300 --> 01:45:25.600
Jupiter which rules Sagittarius Higher Learning philosophy


2122
01:45:25.600 --> 01:45:28.700
travel distance. This is all Sagittarius


2123
01:45:28.700 --> 01:45:31.200
Jupiter, which everybody thinks is an amazing


2124
01:45:31.200 --> 01:45:34.400
planet and for the most part it is because Jupiter also rules


2125
01:45:34.400 --> 01:45:37.100
luck, which I don't think I put on here but it does


2126
01:45:37.100 --> 01:45:40.300
I didn't remember I did this a couple


2127
01:45:40.300 --> 01:45:44.500
minutes before I started. So I was putting all this together real quick Sagittarius


2128
01:45:43.500 --> 01:45:46.100
is the Archer. This is


2129
01:45:46.100 --> 01:45:49.200
the symbol for Sagittarius. This is Jupiter which rules it and you'll see


2130
01:45:49.200 --> 01:45:52.300
this which looks kind of like a number four four by the way is a


2131
01:45:52.300 --> 01:45:54.000
lucky number. It's how I remember that


2132
01:45:55.600 --> 01:45:59.400
it is a mutable sign meaning changeable fire passion shortbirts


2133
01:45:58.400 --> 01:46:01.800
bursts of energy a lot of sagittarians get


2134
01:46:01.800 --> 01:46:03.300
second wins very easily.


2135
01:46:04.800 --> 01:46:07.900
It's all about Higher Learning this includes College if


2136
01:46:07.900 --> 01:46:10.300
you're going to trade school, if you're trying to learn something that


2137
01:46:10.300 --> 01:46:13.500
requires more than just the basics. Remember the basics being


2138
01:46:13.500 --> 01:46:16.600
the third ninth axis. The basics is


2139
01:46:16.600 --> 01:46:19.800
all Gemini. This is the facts. This is the philosophy


2140
01:46:19.800 --> 01:46:20.800
and application.


2141
01:46:22.600 --> 01:46:23.500
of knowledge


2142
01:46:24.400 --> 01:46:24.900
there goes


2143
01:46:25.700 --> 01:46:28.400
It is also beliefs so politics which


2144
01:46:28.400 --> 01:46:32.300
I didn't put on your other politics your opinions religion


2145
01:46:31.300 --> 01:46:34.500
as in terms of the actual philosophy of


2146
01:46:34.500 --> 01:46:37.500
religions not the church. The church is ruled by Capricorn


2147
01:46:37.500 --> 01:46:41.100
and Saturn as a structure. The belief system


2148
01:46:40.100 --> 01:46:44.600
within religion is ruled by


2149
01:46:44.600 --> 01:46:47.600
Sagittarius. It's all your opinions. We had


2150
01:46:47.600 --> 01:46:49.100
a huge thing going on.


2151
01:46:50.200 --> 01:46:53.400
That's not right. There we go. We had a huge thing going on during the


2152
01:46:53.400 --> 01:46:56.700
phase of Gemini, which we just left. It was 2008


2153
01:46:56.700 --> 01:47:00.300
to roughly 2022 and to 2020.


2154
01:46:59.300 --> 01:47:02.300
We're like on the cusp. We're


2155
01:47:02.300 --> 01:47:03.300
really in cancer now, but


2156
01:47:05.200 --> 01:47:08.700
The bipolarity of Gemini over the last 10 to


2157
01:47:08.700 --> 01:47:11.400
15 ish years bringing in the opposite


2158
01:47:11.400 --> 01:47:14.400
axis of politics and opinion. It literally was


2159
01:47:14.400 --> 01:47:17.300
fact versus opinion and people justifying their


2160
01:47:17.300 --> 01:47:20.400
opinions thinking they're factually accurate. This was


2161
01:47:20.400 --> 01:47:23.700
the last this was a rough time for everybody in this


2162
01:47:23.700 --> 01:47:25.800
brought in a lot of problems in terms of the phase.


2163
01:47:26.900 --> 01:47:29.600
we're now in cancer the phase


2164
01:47:29.600 --> 01:47:33.600
of cancer which is healing now when I talk about age-era phase


2165
01:47:33.600 --> 01:47:36.900
these are breakdowns of very large or


2166
01:47:36.900 --> 01:47:41.000
very long-lasting over 2,000


2167
01:47:40.200 --> 01:47:44.000
year, you know time periods the once


2168
01:47:43.100 --> 01:47:46.600
they break down and then break down again into each


2169
01:47:46.600 --> 01:47:49.200
sign you're talking about 10 to 15 years in each


2170
01:47:49.200 --> 01:47:52.900
sign for the phases depending on the constellation and then


2171
01:47:52.900 --> 01:47:55.500
the eras are one cycle is


2172
01:47:55.500 --> 01:47:56.300
one sign so


2173
01:47:57.500 --> 01:48:00.400
Ages work backwards the other two work forward. I'll do


2174
01:48:00.400 --> 01:48:03.400
that in a different thing. The age of Aquarius is next but the errors and


2175
01:48:03.400 --> 01:48:06.500
phases move forward around counterclockwise around


2176
01:48:06.500 --> 01:48:06.800
the chart.


2177
01:48:07.600 --> 01:48:09.700
When I get into Sagittarian energy.


2178
01:48:10.700 --> 01:48:13.600
Pluto Chiron and the moon are the


2179
01:48:13.600 --> 01:48:16.300
three major ones. We're not there yet. But I


2180
01:48:16.300 --> 01:48:20.200
just wanted to point out that those three are going to be vital for


2181
01:48:19.200 --> 01:48:21.200
self-transformation.


2182
01:48:22.600 --> 01:48:25.600
Journeys travel long distance travel if


2183
01:48:25.600 --> 01:48:28.900
you're moving and you're moving like in


2184
01:48:28.900 --> 01:48:31.700
within the same city or the next town over that's Gemini energy.


2185
01:48:31.700 --> 01:48:34.600
If you're moving state to state country to


2186
01:48:34.600 --> 01:48:37.200
country that is Sagittarius and it


2187
01:48:37.200 --> 01:48:40.300
also has to do with culture. So whenever we're talking about which goes


2188
01:48:40.300 --> 01:48:43.000
in with philosophy and beliefs and religion is culture.


2189
01:48:43.700 --> 01:48:46.400
It all has to do with anything of the philosophical mind


2190
01:48:46.400 --> 01:48:49.400
the what if anything that's what if anything that's


2191
01:48:49.400 --> 01:48:54.000
really hard to prove. Gemini is provable. Sagittarius


2192
01:48:52.200 --> 01:48:55.400
is very difficult to prove.


2193
01:48:56.400 --> 01:48:59.100
Journeys travel. Yeah, so whenever you


2194
01:48:59.100 --> 01:49:02.700
take a plane ride you're looking at Jupiter. So you want to make sure Jupiter's


2195
01:49:02.700 --> 01:49:05.400
favorable Sagittarius and/or your ninth


2196
01:49:05.400 --> 01:49:08.200
house again, your ninth house rules higher education, like


2197
01:49:08.200 --> 01:49:11.600
colleges and universities. Although private universities are


2198
01:49:11.600 --> 01:49:13.200
actually the 11th house, but we'll get to that later.


2199
01:49:14.200 --> 01:49:17.600
Your meaning this is what's my


2200
01:49:17.600 --> 01:49:20.500
life purpose? What am I supposed to be here?


2201
01:49:20.500 --> 01:49:23.600
For now? We're talking about life purpose not in a spiritual way a


2202
01:49:23.600 --> 01:49:26.500
soul away because that's the North Node not in a


2203
01:49:26.500 --> 01:49:29.600
career way because that's the mid heaven, but we're talking about like, where's


2204
01:49:29.600 --> 01:49:30.600
my place in the world?


2205
01:49:31.700 --> 01:49:34.500
Is this more about the you know you where you


2206
01:49:34.500 --> 01:49:37.500
are in the world as opposed to like life purpose


2207
01:49:37.500 --> 01:49:40.500
meaning? What am I supposed to do? Where am


2208
01:49:40.500 --> 01:49:44.200
I supposed to be? How do I fit in with everything the what


2209
01:49:43.200 --> 01:49:46.100
ifs the howls that's all


2210
01:49:46.100 --> 01:49:50.200
Sagittarius? So that has to do with all kinds of philosophy anything


2211
01:49:49.200 --> 01:49:52.700
anytime you test something anything. It's like theoretical.


2212
01:49:52.700 --> 01:49:57.000
That's all Sagittarius. This is like Play-Doh Socrates


2213
01:49:56.800 --> 01:49:59.200
Aristotle. It's that kind of energy there.


2214
01:49:59.200 --> 01:50:02.100
But it also Co rules law. It's not


2215
01:50:02.100 --> 01:50:05.200
law as in legal matters. It's law as in the actual.


2216
01:50:07.600 --> 01:50:10.300
The actual like Philosophy of Law


2217
01:50:10.300 --> 01:50:14.400
meaning I study law I practice law. I may lawyer me


2218
01:50:13.400 --> 01:50:16.300
going and having a legal case is


2219
01:50:16.300 --> 01:50:20.400
Libra me practicing law is Sagittarius.


2220
01:50:21.300 --> 01:50:24.400
So you see how it can be confusing sometimes because you're talking


2221
01:50:24.400 --> 01:50:27.200
in in the day-to-day context. We're just it's


2222
01:50:27.200 --> 01:50:30.700
law but it's not legal matters are different sign


2223
01:50:30.700 --> 01:50:33.600
than the philosophy the the beliefs the


2224
01:50:33.600 --> 01:50:36.400
system of belief of Law and how it plays out


2225
01:50:36.400 --> 01:50:40.100
because law is made off of what the the


2226
01:50:39.100 --> 01:50:43.000
people who wrote it but usually the collective or


2227
01:50:42.200 --> 01:50:45.200
whoever was involved believed in


2228
01:50:45.200 --> 01:50:48.700
that's why laws change that's why some laws are Antiquated because


2229
01:50:48.700 --> 01:50:51.000
those things change our beliefs change and that's why


2230
01:50:51.400 --> 01:50:54.900
the actual term of law is on that morals in


2231
01:50:54.900 --> 01:50:55.700
terms of ethics.


2232
01:50:56.500 --> 01:51:00.100
The second house also rules morals, but it's more like manners this


2233
01:50:59.100 --> 01:51:02.600
is because it has to do with Elegance. This


2234
01:51:02.600 --> 01:51:05.200
has to do with like your philosophical morals.


2235
01:51:05.800 --> 01:51:08.300
You know holding the door. I mean


2236
01:51:08.300 --> 01:51:11.100
that could go both ways. Why are you holding the door open for somebody


2237
01:51:11.100 --> 01:51:14.500
that's Sagittarius just doing it is the


2238
01:51:14.500 --> 01:51:17.300
value is what you were taught to do, which is a little


2239
01:51:17.300 --> 01:51:20.400
bit Capricorn but it's the value of it holding the door because it


2240
01:51:20.400 --> 01:51:23.400
is nice that is the Venus side of it. And like


2241
01:51:23.400 --> 01:51:26.000
I said ethics when you're talking about integrity when you're


2242
01:51:26.200 --> 01:51:26.400
talking about


2243
01:51:28.400 --> 01:51:31.200
For instance when people buy something from me and I cannot


2244
01:51:31.200 --> 01:51:31.500
deliver.


2245
01:51:32.700 --> 01:51:35.700
Do I refund them? I do absolutely because


2246
01:51:35.700 --> 01:51:39.900
I can't I have extremely extremely


2247
01:51:38.900 --> 01:51:41.300
strong ethics and


2248
01:51:41.300 --> 01:51:44.300
this is not shadiness the way when I was young. I


2249
01:51:44.300 --> 01:51:47.100
used to lie a lot and then I got closer to


2250
01:51:47.100 --> 01:51:50.500
like my late teens and this Gemini energy with Pluto


2251
01:51:50.500 --> 01:51:53.100
this harmonious flow here in this Trine which again we'll talk


2252
01:51:53.100 --> 01:51:53.900
about in another class.


2253
01:51:54.800 --> 01:51:57.200
I didn't want to do that anymore. I couldn't keep up


2254
01:51:57.200 --> 01:52:00.500
with the lies basically with this Uranus here. I lied all


2255
01:52:00.500 --> 01:52:00.600
the time.


2256
01:52:01.500 --> 01:52:04.200
And then I realized with it on my IC opposing my


2257
01:52:04.200 --> 01:52:07.200
midheaven of value with value here.


2258
01:52:07.200 --> 01:52:10.600
I don't want to lie anymore. I I I'm afraid


2259
01:52:10.600 --> 01:52:13.700
of getting caught with Chiron here. There's an insecurity within


2260
01:52:13.700 --> 01:52:16.200
my own lying. I am honest because the


2261
01:52:16.200 --> 01:52:19.700
energies have made me honest, but when I was younger, I


2262
01:52:19.700 --> 01:52:22.700
didn't feel that way. I felt like I needed


2263
01:52:22.700 --> 01:52:25.400
to lie I needed to because I didn't I was afraid of


2264
01:52:25.400 --> 01:52:25.800
punishment.


2265
01:52:27.400 --> 01:52:27.900
you see


2266
01:52:28.700 --> 01:52:31.000
and there's an in conjunction here, which means it took me a minute


2267
01:52:31.300 --> 01:52:31.800
to figure that out.


2268
01:52:32.800 --> 01:52:33.800
But that's how that plays out.


2269
01:52:37.800 --> 01:52:40.200
So for Libra Rising do we


2270
01:52:40.200 --> 01:52:43.400
possibly run into the potential of seeing our opinions as


2271
01:52:43.400 --> 01:52:44.600
facts? Yes.


2272
01:52:45.700 --> 01:52:48.300
Absolutely, because your third and Ninth house are flipped


2273
01:52:48.300 --> 01:52:52.000
when we start getting into different charts.


2274
01:52:51.200 --> 01:52:54.300
A lot of that's on my YouTube channel that I'm gonna start talking about


2275
01:52:54.300 --> 01:52:57.100
Libra risings are an interesting


2276
01:52:57.100 --> 01:53:00.400
because they're literally a mirror of everything that should be


2277
01:53:00.400 --> 01:53:03.200
they as a leap of


2278
01:53:03.200 --> 01:53:06.300
rising. They need relationships identify. They feel natural in a


2279
01:53:06.300 --> 01:53:09.500
relationship. But the irony is when they're in them because areas in


2280
01:53:09.500 --> 01:53:12.600
the seventh house they argue they alienate their


2281
01:53:12.600 --> 01:53:15.200
partner to do things. They're very selfish within their relationship and


2282
01:53:15.200 --> 01:53:16.500
it's something they usually have to learn


2283
01:53:17.400 --> 01:53:21.000
every chart every rising sign has something but that's


2284
01:53:20.400 --> 01:53:24.100
one thing that I've noticed with labor


2285
01:53:23.100 --> 01:53:26.800
risings there. Everything is flipped and


2286
01:53:26.800 --> 01:53:29.900
it does make things a bit more difficult. Libra


2287
01:53:29.900 --> 01:53:32.400
risings have Scorpio in the second house and obviously


2288
01:53:32.400 --> 01:53:35.200
where Pluto is matters, but that means


2289
01:53:35.200 --> 01:53:38.200
Naturally Speaking. They don't own their own


2290
01:53:38.200 --> 01:53:41.600
stuff. It's always somebody else's stuff or it's a hand-me-down or


2291
01:53:41.600 --> 01:53:44.600
it's just shared with somebody Libra risings


2292
01:53:44.600 --> 01:53:47.400
are like the type to share like makeup or share their


2293
01:53:47.400 --> 01:53:48.500
hair brush with their mother.


2294
01:53:49.500 --> 01:53:51.900
again, depending on where all the planets are sitting


2295
01:53:53.100 --> 01:53:56.300
We're going to move into Capricorn here. The Capricorn energy is


2296
01:53:56.300 --> 01:53:59.900
what most people strongly dislike.


2297
01:53:59.900 --> 01:54:02.100
They always hate this they always


2298
01:54:02.100 --> 01:54:05.700
look forward toward to it when they're talking about career and you know


2299
01:54:05.700 --> 01:54:08.300
what they're gonna end up doing, you know for a job


2300
01:54:08.300 --> 01:54:11.400
and whatnot. But they tend to have a very difficult time


2301
01:54:11.400 --> 01:54:14.300
with actual Saturn energy as it rules


2302
01:54:14.300 --> 01:54:17.700
the tenth house with here because it does have to do with your reputation, but


2303
01:54:17.700 --> 01:54:18.500
it is the


2304
01:54:21.400 --> 01:54:24.300
It's the goat. It is the goat. The greatest of all


2305
01:54:24.300 --> 01:54:27.100
time is literally it. It's the one that's striving for


2306
01:54:27.100 --> 01:54:27.500
the best.


2307
01:54:28.400 --> 01:54:31.300
This is the energy or I'm sorry, the glyph for


2308
01:54:31.300 --> 01:54:34.700
Capricorns ruled by Saturn people don't like Saturn


2309
01:54:34.700 --> 01:54:37.900
why because Saturn return has such a bad rep because if you fight Saturn


2310
01:54:37.900 --> 01:54:40.100
Saturn's the daddy energy Saturn's all


2311
01:54:40.100 --> 01:54:43.500
about Saturn is Father Time. Literally Father Time


2312
01:54:43.500 --> 01:54:46.300
wherever Saturn sits in your chart that is


2313
01:54:46.300 --> 01:54:49.300
going to happen for you later in life. You being able


2314
01:54:49.300 --> 01:54:52.500
to master that area of life is going to happen later on


2315
01:54:52.500 --> 01:54:55.600
Saturn causes delays and restrictions, which


2316
01:54:55.600 --> 01:54:57.400
I don't have down here by this important to know.


2317
01:54:58.400 --> 01:55:01.400
It's Cardinal sign starts winter Capricorn is


2318
01:55:01.400 --> 01:55:04.500
cold. That's why it's the beginning of winter it


2319
01:55:04.500 --> 01:55:04.500
is.


2320
01:55:05.600 --> 01:55:08.000
It once the best for you, it's all about


2321
01:55:08.700 --> 01:55:11.800
rounding out everything so that you can start anew because that's


2322
01:55:11.800 --> 01:55:13.500
gonna lead us into spring again.


2323
01:55:14.300 --> 01:55:17.400
It's starting that process for you and it's an earth


2324
01:55:17.400 --> 01:55:20.300
sign. What I say is what I say. What I want is


2325
01:55:20.300 --> 01:55:23.100
what I want not in a Mars way not in an Aries way,


2326
01:55:23.100 --> 01:55:26.200
but in a I know it's best for you. I'm the authority you're gonna


2327
01:55:26.200 --> 01:55:29.700
do it now, obviously when it's poorly Afflicted it causes problems, but


2328
01:55:29.700 --> 01:55:32.500
when it's positively when it


2329
01:55:32.500 --> 01:55:35.500
positively resonates, it is great for career. It's


2330
01:55:35.500 --> 01:55:38.900
great for having Authority with with Saturn in


2331
01:55:38.900 --> 01:55:40.400
the third house. I actually have it here.


2332
01:55:41.400 --> 01:55:44.200
With Saturn or Capricorn in the third house, you have to ignore


2333
01:55:44.200 --> 01:55:47.100
the other two planets because they add flavor to it.


2334
01:55:47.100 --> 01:55:50.200
But this brings in the sense of


2335
01:55:50.200 --> 01:55:53.700
authority within the theme so when it comes to my businesses,


2336
01:55:53.700 --> 01:55:56.100
I'm the boss. I am I do


2337
01:55:56.100 --> 01:55:59.800
not let other people run my business. I do not do equal Partnerships. Even


2338
01:55:59.800 --> 01:56:03.300
if it's legally equal our what do


2339
01:56:03.300 --> 01:56:03.400
you call them?


2340
01:56:04.200 --> 01:56:07.800
Operating agreement always says that I have final say it's


2341
01:56:07.800 --> 01:56:10.200
just the way that it is. It's the way I have to have it and I


2342
01:56:10.200 --> 01:56:13.500
also have my moon over here and all this is all this kind of goes together


2343
01:56:13.500 --> 01:56:16.300
and whatnot. But I also have the authority in


2344
01:56:16.300 --> 01:56:19.200
my communication when I get to a certain point where I've said


2345
01:56:19.200 --> 01:56:22.800
what I've said, I do not like to repeat myself and I


2346
01:56:22.800 --> 01:56:25.300
won't repeat myself. I put my foot down and


2347
01:56:25.300 --> 01:56:28.900
it's Authority and I will only do that if I feel that it's


2348
01:56:28.900 --> 01:56:31.300
needed to be for compassion reasons.


2349
01:56:32.300 --> 01:56:35.000
Which is this energy here and this energy here, which is part of


2350
01:56:35.200 --> 01:56:38.500
my kite. If I let go of my ego for a minute and have some


2351
01:56:38.500 --> 01:56:41.600
empathy that's part of what all these aspect patterns


2352
01:56:41.600 --> 01:56:44.500
mean, but people who don't have that might not


2353
01:56:44.500 --> 01:56:47.800
go to that Neptune when I was younger. I ignored


2354
01:56:47.800 --> 01:56:50.300
this Neptune in order to access your


2355
01:56:50.300 --> 01:56:53.300
kite. I had to or my kite I had to use Neptune again.


2356
01:56:54.200 --> 01:56:58.100
This is a bit more advanced but it's important to understand wherever Saturn


2357
01:56:57.100 --> 01:57:00.500
is in your chart. That's where you think you


2358
01:57:00.500 --> 01:57:03.700
have authority that's where you act as though your authoritarian


2359
01:57:03.700 --> 01:57:06.400
this here also day to


2360
01:57:06.400 --> 01:57:09.600
day. I always ended up being a manager even


2361
01:57:09.600 --> 01:57:12.400
if I wasn't paid for it. That was the problem is that


2362
01:57:12.400 --> 01:57:15.400
I always wasn't paid for it. But I ended up being the manager


2363
01:57:15.400 --> 01:57:18.400
of the boss all the time. I was hiring manager. I was you know,


2364
01:57:18.400 --> 01:57:21.100
hired as a host at a restaurant and I ended


2365
01:57:21.100 --> 01:57:24.300
up the like doing everything. It's the assistant manager. I work for Radio Shack


2366
01:57:24.300 --> 01:57:27.000
at 17 and they made me the store manager didn't pay me


2367
01:57:27.200 --> 01:57:28.100
for it. That's all this.


2368
01:57:29.300 --> 01:57:32.300
That's the in conjunction with that ruler here, not understanding my


2369
01:57:32.300 --> 01:57:35.200
own value and getting paid that stuff. I had to


2370
01:57:35.200 --> 01:57:36.500
learn in the future.


2371
01:57:38.800 --> 01:57:41.300
But let me go back. We're talking about career and


2372
01:57:41.300 --> 01:57:44.100
Public Image. If you have mercury in the 10th house, you're a public


2373
01:57:44.100 --> 01:57:47.100
speaker. This is natural for you. It's what you want to do. You also


2374
01:57:47.100 --> 01:57:50.300
think about your career and talk about your career a lot Public Image


2375
01:57:50.300 --> 01:57:53.100
and reputation. It's your father. It's anybody who


2376
01:57:53.100 --> 01:57:56.200
has a father or authoritarian figures now with


2377
01:57:56.200 --> 01:57:59.400
the fourth and 12th axis. What's interesting is it can


2378
01:57:59.400 --> 01:58:02.700
be flipped? Sometimes if your father was gone or even


2379
01:58:02.700 --> 01:58:06.500
if your father was there and your mother was the authority there's


2380
01:58:05.500 --> 01:58:09.000
a mix she still the


2381
01:58:08.100 --> 01:58:11.200
mother. She's still the fourth house your father's technically


2382
01:58:11.200 --> 01:58:12.100
still the 10th house.


2383
01:58:12.800 --> 01:58:15.400
but the way most of it waited out plays is


2384
01:58:15.400 --> 01:58:18.700
that the mother ends up being the 10th


2385
01:58:18.700 --> 01:58:21.100
house in the father ends up being the fourth house and I've seen that in a few


2386
01:58:21.100 --> 01:58:23.700
charts and it's it's all about experience and


2387
01:58:26.100 --> 01:58:29.200
and perspective the big thing about astrology when I was


2388
01:58:29.200 --> 01:58:33.000
talking about it being not black and white is this has to do not with


2389
01:58:32.800 --> 01:58:36.100
what it is, but how


2390
01:58:35.100 --> 01:58:38.500
you see it and how it seems


2391
01:58:38.500 --> 01:58:41.100
to affect you and it is how you


2392
01:58:41.100 --> 01:58:44.200
affect you but it's up to you how you actually see it.


2393
01:58:44.200 --> 01:58:47.200
It's it's it brings in that philosophy which


2394
01:58:47.200 --> 01:58:50.400
is why Jupiter Co rules astrology. You have to change your


2395
01:58:50.400 --> 01:58:53.500
beliefs in order to use astrology effectively. If you


2396
01:58:53.500 --> 01:58:56.300
don't believe if you believe that astrology tells


2397
01:58:56.300 --> 01:58:59.200
you what is the way it's always gonna be that's the way


2398
01:58:59.200 --> 01:59:01.600
it's gonna be because you're not using it. You're not transmuting the energy


2399
01:59:02.500 --> 01:59:05.200
But we can because you believe it because you can because


2400
01:59:05.200 --> 01:59:06.200
you've seen it and done it.


2401
01:59:06.900 --> 01:59:10.500
Large organizations and government. I'm Amazon


2402
01:59:09.500 --> 01:59:12.600
is tenth house


2403
01:59:12.600 --> 01:59:15.300
Capricorn energy the little guy who


2404
01:59:15.300 --> 01:59:18.800
owns or girl wife. Whoever owns


2405
01:59:18.800 --> 01:59:21.200
the Mom Pop shop on the corner. That's the


2406
01:59:21.200 --> 01:59:24.100
11th house. That's that's small organizations. The big


2407
01:59:24.100 --> 01:59:27.700
ones are Capricorn the one with authority the one with this a


2408
01:59:27.700 --> 01:59:30.300
different sense of powers. It's not Pluto power internal power.


2409
01:59:30.300 --> 01:59:33.200
This is authoritarian presence and Power.


2410
01:59:34.100 --> 01:59:37.300
It has to do with your long-term goals, not your hopes and dreams but your


2411
01:59:37.300 --> 01:59:37.500
actual.


2412
01:59:38.200 --> 01:59:41.400
Not the strategy how you're going to get there, but the goals the


2413
01:59:41.400 --> 01:59:44.400
Milestones that you're setting for yourself that is Capricorn energy because


2414
01:59:44.400 --> 01:59:47.800
it takes time to get to them. Remember Saturn has


2415
01:59:47.800 --> 01:59:49.300
to do with time delays restrictions.


2416
01:59:50.300 --> 01:59:52.500
And it also has to do with Focus.


2417
01:59:53.600 --> 01:59:57.200
And then tradition and structure the church because it


2418
01:59:57.200 --> 02:00:01.600
is a structure the church is the religious side


2419
02:00:00.600 --> 02:00:03.400
when we're talking about religion. The


2420
02:00:03.400 --> 02:00:05.900
church is Capricorn not Jupiter.


2421
02:00:06.600 --> 02:00:09.500
The actual belief is Jupiter also has


2422
02:00:09.500 --> 02:00:11.700
to do a structures like actual physical buildings as well.


2423
02:00:15.300 --> 02:00:17.800
mc-9 test plus this


2424
02:00:19.400 --> 02:00:22.100
Mid heaven, I'm not gonna be able to get to angles. I'm gonna


2425
02:00:22.100 --> 02:00:25.300
start my next class with the angles. This is


2426
02:00:25.300 --> 02:00:28.400
my first class ever guys. So the timing I was


2427
02:00:28.400 --> 02:00:29.200
like not sure.


2428
02:00:30.200 --> 02:00:33.200
How much I can get in but we're doing well. I'm just not gonna get to angles. I'm


2429
02:00:33.200 --> 02:00:36.300
going to do that in the next class. So but I will answer this


2430
02:00:36.300 --> 02:00:39.600
mid-heaven usually in the 10th or can it be in the ninth if


2431
02:00:39.600 --> 02:00:42.300
you use placidus house system. It's always


2432
02:00:42.300 --> 02:00:44.000
the 10th house cusp.


2433
02:00:45.700 --> 02:00:46.200
but in


2434
02:00:47.100 --> 02:00:50.800
in whole science, it could be in the ninth tenth or


2435
02:00:50.800 --> 02:00:53.400
11th house and that just means whether or


2436
02:00:53.400 --> 02:00:56.500
not there's an aspect of authority. There's more of a belief system


2437
02:00:56.500 --> 02:00:59.500
and you doing the things that you feel you want to do or


2438
02:00:59.500 --> 02:01:02.400
you work with teams and you kind of do like you chase


2439
02:01:02.400 --> 02:01:05.100
more of your hopes and dreams and philanthropy and things of that nature.


2440
02:01:09.200 --> 02:01:12.900
Thank you Kathy. I appreciate the the compliment there.


2441
02:01:12.900 --> 02:01:15.300
So this is like I said Capricorn the


2442
02:01:15.300 --> 02:01:18.600
goat again Saturn tenth


2443
02:01:18.600 --> 02:01:21.300
house goat greatest of all time. It's the


2444
02:01:21.300 --> 02:01:24.700
achievement the reputation people who have stuff


2445
02:01:24.700 --> 02:01:27.400
in the tenth house Venus in


2446
02:01:27.400 --> 02:01:30.300
the tenth house for me is I have to have a public image


2447
02:01:30.300 --> 02:01:34.500
of respect. I have to have a public image of having luxury.


2448
02:01:33.500 --> 02:01:37.100
I have to have a public image of this Chiron


2449
02:01:36.100 --> 02:01:40.500
comes in and says people don't believe me which is


2450
02:01:40.500 --> 02:01:44.200
why I've done a few tiktok videos and I'm like, they're like,


2451
02:01:44.200 --> 02:01:47.600
you're not a millionaire. You're not a billionaire. I'm like, look, I'm not gonna tell you my financials


2452
02:01:47.600 --> 02:01:50.000
here. But here's what I drive. Here's the


2453
02:01:50.200 --> 02:01:53.100
house. I live in there's still like, you know, it just is


2454
02:01:53.100 --> 02:01:56.300
what it is. Now. I use this to heal the public I use this


2455
02:01:56.300 --> 02:01:59.900
as a healing my reputation is of a Healer now, I've used


2456
02:01:59.900 --> 02:02:02.300
this in the way. I followed my life purpose to


2457
02:02:02.300 --> 02:02:05.000
get to this point but things in the 10th house


2458
02:02:05.300 --> 02:02:08.200
always have to do with career reputation and they


2459
02:02:08.200 --> 02:02:09.100
do affect your rep.


2460
02:02:09.200 --> 02:02:13.200
And how your reputation plays out again relocation astrology,


2461
02:02:12.200 --> 02:02:15.600
which is going to be a different course is going


2462
02:02:15.600 --> 02:02:18.200
to move your mid or could move your mid


2463
02:02:18.200 --> 02:02:21.300
having your tenth house in all those planets somewhere else because your sentient moves


2464
02:02:21.300 --> 02:02:24.200
and it literally turns the wheel for you and then it's


2465
02:02:24.200 --> 02:02:27.600
a new layer which can be good or bad depending on where it


2466
02:02:27.600 --> 02:02:30.200
is, which is why it's good to get a good reading and not just


2467
02:02:30.200 --> 02:02:31.100
someone who looks at the map.


2468
02:02:32.200 --> 02:02:35.900
As we move on to the 11th. Oh is Aquarius


2469
02:02:35.900 --> 02:02:38.500
ruled by Saturn or is it ruled by Uranus?


2470
02:02:38.500 --> 02:02:39.400
Make it make sense?


2471
02:02:40.400 --> 02:02:42.500
This is a good question. I'm moving into Aquarius now.


2472
02:02:43.200 --> 02:02:46.700
Remember tenth house is all about home and work balance on that access. So


2473
02:02:46.700 --> 02:02:49.700
cancer is all about home. This is about outward.


2474
02:02:49.700 --> 02:02:52.800
This is also what people see what you put physically out


2475
02:02:52.800 --> 02:02:56.500
for people to see is Capricorn energy. Now Capricorn


2476
02:02:55.500 --> 02:02:58.200
is ruled by the 10th house.


2477
02:02:58.200 --> 02:03:02.500
Aquarius is ruled definitively by Uranus


2478
02:03:01.500 --> 02:03:05.300
in the 11th house now traditional astrologers


2479
02:03:04.300 --> 02:03:07.400
believe it is Saturn here is my problem.


2480
02:03:07.400 --> 02:03:10.700
Once we get into Uranus which rules friendships


2481
02:03:10.700 --> 02:03:13.200
and whatnot. One thing that I don't


2482
02:03:13.200 --> 02:03:16.300
have on here that's important to understand about Aquarius.


2483
02:03:17.200 --> 02:03:20.900
Is that Saturn is all about tradition and


2484
02:03:20.900 --> 02:03:23.300
structure and things that are old and things


2485
02:03:23.300 --> 02:03:26.300
that have been around for a long time and how we carry that on


2486
02:03:26.300 --> 02:03:30.800
and how it stays in place and it doesn't change ironically


2487
02:03:29.800 --> 02:03:32.300
as Aquarius as a


2488
02:03:32.300 --> 02:03:36.100
fixed sign. It's all about destroying and


2489
02:03:35.100 --> 02:03:38.100
breaking down those structures. It's the one


2490
02:03:38.100 --> 02:03:41.700
that comes right after and it says these are the structures that are outmoded that


2491
02:03:41.700 --> 02:03:44.100
don't work anymore. And it says this is


2492
02:03:44.100 --> 02:03:47.900
what we're going to do is we're going to take them down and we're going to move them


2493
02:03:47.900 --> 02:03:48.100
forward.


2494
02:03:49.100 --> 02:03:52.700
Now that alone doesn't necessarily separate


2495
02:03:52.700 --> 02:03:55.200
because you could say oh that's just a different side of


2496
02:03:55.200 --> 02:03:58.600
Saturn right? That doesn't by itself say


2497
02:03:58.600 --> 02:04:02.300
that Aquarius could not be ruled by


2498
02:04:01.300 --> 02:04:04.800
Saturn but it's a very different energy


2499
02:04:04.800 --> 02:04:08.100
because it's literally about change ironically because


2500
02:04:07.100 --> 02:04:10.600
it's a fixed sign. It's about


2501
02:04:10.600 --> 02:04:12.400
change within the same system.


2502
02:04:13.200 --> 02:04:14.200
and I think that's


2503
02:04:15.100 --> 02:04:18.500
That's important to understand that often when you have Aquarius it's


2504
02:04:18.500 --> 02:04:21.800
with it's an erratic energy within a system. So


2505
02:04:21.800 --> 02:04:25.000
it does have that kind of saturnian energy because


2506
02:04:24.300 --> 02:04:27.300
it comes right afterwards, but it's all


2507
02:04:27.300 --> 02:04:30.300
about independence. It's about the lone wolf and


2508
02:04:30.300 --> 02:04:33.400
freedom and Detachment a structure needs.


2509
02:04:33.400 --> 02:04:36.800
It's Foundation needs everything in place to work whereas


2510
02:04:36.800 --> 02:04:37.700
Aquarius says.


2511
02:04:38.600 --> 02:04:41.600
I don't want that. It's literally the opposite it says


2512
02:04:41.600 --> 02:04:44.600
I'm going to go wherever I want and I don't care about your system.


2513
02:04:44.600 --> 02:04:47.300
I don't care about your structure. By the way Capricorn is


2514
02:04:47.300 --> 02:04:50.900
also systems. I don't care about that which is why Mercury


2515
02:04:50.900 --> 02:04:53.300
and retrograde and Capricorn was making it very


2516
02:04:53.300 --> 02:04:56.100
difficult to put all this together. Y'all don't know this but I


2517
02:04:56.100 --> 02:04:59.200
have some serious issues getting this all together and I'm glad it came in


2518
02:04:59.200 --> 02:05:02.500
place. But I knew that from the astrology that it would all fall oops


2519
02:05:02.500 --> 02:05:06.200
that it would all fall together come together, but for


2520
02:05:05.200 --> 02:05:08.400
a second I was like am I wrong I got


2521
02:05:08.400 --> 02:05:11.500
to make sure but but Aquarius is


2522
02:05:11.500 --> 02:05:14.300
all about hopes and dreams. It's about


2523
02:05:14.300 --> 02:05:17.400
Freedom Independence not in


2524
02:05:17.400 --> 02:05:20.700
a Mars way not in areas way where you're doing what you want, you know


2525
02:05:20.700 --> 02:05:23.200
to to drive forward and be pioneering but it's


2526
02:05:23.200 --> 02:05:26.900
revolutionary. It takes systems and changes


2527
02:05:26.900 --> 02:05:29.500
them and make some new perfect example, one


2528
02:05:29.500 --> 02:05:32.400
of the main things of my life for every career. I


2529
02:05:32.400 --> 02:05:35.100
have ever done every single business I have and you


2530
02:05:35.100 --> 02:05:36.000
guys know some of you


2531
02:05:36.700 --> 02:05:39.200
know that we have so many things that


2532
02:05:39.200 --> 02:05:39.600
we do.


2533
02:05:40.400 --> 02:05:42.400
I always take something that exists.


2534
02:05:43.300 --> 02:05:46.400
And I create I change it and I create something better from


2535
02:05:46.400 --> 02:05:49.200
it. But I'm not the guy coming up at the brand new


2536
02:05:49.200 --> 02:05:52.500
thing. I would need I would


2537
02:05:52.500 --> 02:05:55.100
need other placements in it to sit other ways. I take


2538
02:05:55.100 --> 02:05:55.800
other my


2539
02:05:57.200 --> 02:06:00.400
My my moon is in Aquarius. All of


2540
02:06:00.400 --> 02:06:04.100
this energy is in the 11th house which rules aquarius so that


2541
02:06:03.100 --> 02:06:06.400
energy is all put together


2542
02:06:06.400 --> 02:06:09.600
and then mercury in the sign of Aquarius is opposite


2543
02:06:09.600 --> 02:06:12.400
Uranus. So this is literally opposing and balancing and


2544
02:06:12.400 --> 02:06:13.400
this has to do with


2545
02:06:14.400 --> 02:06:17.400
Pulling it all together which is trying Pluto, which is


2546
02:06:17.400 --> 02:06:20.100
other people's stuff, right? So that's the way that it plays


2547
02:06:20.100 --> 02:06:23.500
out is a combination of Pluto and Aquarius as opposed to just Aquarius


2548
02:06:23.500 --> 02:06:26.200
itself because Aquarius can be revolutionary. It can


2549
02:06:26.200 --> 02:06:29.600
be something brand new in my chart. It's taking somebody else's


2550
02:06:29.600 --> 02:06:32.400
thing making it mine and then changing it


2551
02:06:32.400 --> 02:06:35.100
and making it new that's how my energy plays out.


2552
02:06:35.100 --> 02:06:39.100
Right? But Aquarius itself has to do with removing a


2553
02:06:38.100 --> 02:06:42.400
structure and moving forward. It's all about the future Saturn


2554
02:06:41.400 --> 02:06:44.300
is all about the past and the things that have worked


2555
02:06:44.300 --> 02:06:47.000
Aquarius is all about the future the age of


2556
02:06:47.600 --> 02:06:50.500
Aquarius. It's all about the future. It's all about technology which


2557
02:06:50.500 --> 02:06:53.600
is another thing technology and electricity things that


2558
02:06:53.600 --> 02:06:56.400
are electric based have a query and tendencies


2559
02:06:56.400 --> 02:06:59.300
people who are erratic and kind of do this quirks things


2560
02:06:59.300 --> 02:07:02.500
that are unique all Aquarian all Uranus energy


2561
02:07:02.500 --> 02:07:03.300
here that we see here.


2562
02:07:04.300 --> 02:07:07.400
Aquarius by the way is the water Bearer and that


2563
02:07:07.400 --> 02:07:10.300
Detachment is very interesting because aquarians are


2564
02:07:10.300 --> 02:07:13.900
as a fixed air sign or actually emotionally intelligent.


2565
02:07:14.700 --> 02:07:17.200
And they and that's why the sign


2566
02:07:17.200 --> 02:07:20.400
is is literally the waves of the water aquarians of


2567
02:07:20.400 --> 02:07:23.000
wherever your Aquarius is that you take that emotional.


2568
02:07:23.900 --> 02:07:26.200
Aspect and you're detached from it. The problem is that


2569
02:07:26.200 --> 02:07:29.500
if you do not deal with the emotional side of it or


2570
02:07:29.500 --> 02:07:33.300
the intuitive side of it you end up being detached


2571
02:07:32.300 --> 02:07:35.400
and realized and not realizing you have that Talent


2572
02:07:35.400 --> 02:07:39.400
there. But also if it's like a lunar Aquarian like me or anyone


2573
02:07:38.400 --> 02:07:41.200
else who has, you know


2574
02:07:41.200 --> 02:07:44.600
moon in the 11th house or anything like that. If you stay detached


2575
02:07:44.600 --> 02:07:47.100
with your emotions, they'll bottle up that this


2576
02:07:49.200 --> 02:07:52.500
I want to say bottle but it that's like a pot or something. Whatever


2577
02:07:52.500 --> 02:07:55.400
this is is container. It's only so big it


2578
02:07:55.400 --> 02:07:58.300
can only hold so much water before it overflows like


2579
02:07:58.300 --> 02:07:58.400
this.


2580
02:07:59.500 --> 02:08:02.300
So it comes with intuition it comes with the future. It's


2581
02:08:02.300 --> 02:08:05.200
the bridge between Saturn and Neptune which is


2582
02:08:05.200 --> 02:08:09.200
why you're in a sits Uranus being eccentric and


2583
02:08:08.200 --> 02:08:11.300
different and unique is the


2584
02:08:11.300 --> 02:08:14.600
only planet in the solar system to rotate the opposite direction and


2585
02:08:14.600 --> 02:08:18.200
sit sideways on its axis. It is unique.


2586
02:08:17.200 --> 02:08:20.900
It's the only one that does that and it's


2587
02:08:20.900 --> 02:08:21.900
Rings go up and down.


2588
02:08:23.200 --> 02:08:26.500
It has rings like Saturn. It's like the new


2589
02:08:26.500 --> 02:08:30.000
Saturn is the way that I see it. It takes


2590
02:08:29.300 --> 02:08:32.200
Center just turns its side. It's very similar to


2591
02:08:32.200 --> 02:08:35.900
it deals with a lot of the same things instead of big organizations.


2592
02:08:35.900 --> 02:08:39.000
It deals with small organizations again, your


2593
02:08:38.300 --> 02:08:42.100
mom Pop Shop anything that's small here teams friends


2594
02:08:41.100 --> 02:08:44.200
networking when you're talking about


2595
02:08:44.200 --> 02:08:47.300
I need to bring this person in this person in and


2596
02:08:47.300 --> 02:08:50.400
kind of do this kind of thing. It's a combination between Gemini and


2597
02:08:50.400 --> 02:08:51.300
Aquarius energy.


2598
02:08:52.300 --> 02:08:55.600
The Gemini energy that the Mercury Mercurial energy


2599
02:08:55.600 --> 02:08:58.300
of the communication that's needed and then


2600
02:08:58.300 --> 02:08:59.700
Aquarius it ruling.


2601
02:09:00.600 --> 02:09:03.700
Technology and electricity is why it rules the internet not


2602
02:09:03.700 --> 02:09:06.700
the media on the internet, but the internet itself


2603
02:09:06.700 --> 02:09:09.500
social media because that is how we Network.


2604
02:09:09.500 --> 02:09:12.300
It's the actual networking when you say something on social


2605
02:09:12.300 --> 02:09:15.400
media It's a combination of Uranus and Gemini, but when


2606
02:09:15.400 --> 02:09:18.800
you are just talking about social media as a as an


2607
02:09:18.800 --> 02:09:21.300
entity, it is Uranian. It is Aquarian ruled


2608
02:09:21.300 --> 02:09:26.500
has to do with Society humanitarium humanitarianism hopes


2609
02:09:25.500 --> 02:09:28.400
dreams. Nonprofits are a


2610
02:09:28.400 --> 02:09:29.100
part of this as well.


2611
02:09:31.800 --> 02:09:34.300
I seem to know more aquarians than any other sign and


2612
02:09:34.300 --> 02:09:35.300
they question everything. Yes.


2613
02:09:36.100 --> 02:09:39.700
Aquarius is all about questioning it.


2614
02:09:39.700 --> 02:09:42.500
Like I said, it's it the questioning everything comes down


2615
02:09:42.500 --> 02:09:43.300
to


2616
02:09:44.600 --> 02:09:47.100
feeling things are outmoded or outdated. This is


2617
02:09:47.100 --> 02:09:50.600
all about moving forward. This is all about saying the medical


2618
02:09:50.600 --> 02:09:53.300
system doesn't work. We need a new medical system.


2619
02:09:53.300 --> 02:09:56.300
That's Aquarian. The government doesn't work.


2620
02:09:56.300 --> 02:09:59.700
We need to break it down and we need to start fresh. That's Aquarian people


2621
02:09:59.700 --> 02:10:02.900
with heavy Aquarian are the revolutionaries. They're


2622
02:10:02.900 --> 02:10:05.100
the ones with the picket signs. They're the


2623
02:10:05.100 --> 02:10:07.700
ones back in the 60s and 70s that would you know,


2624
02:10:08.700 --> 02:10:11.500
Fight avidly for humanitarian goals because


2625
02:10:11.500 --> 02:10:14.200
that they're the philanthropists. They're the ones who want


2626
02:10:14.200 --> 02:10:17.200
betterment for Humanity Humanity as a whole


2627
02:10:17.200 --> 02:10:20.400
and Society. This has to do with large groups of


2628
02:10:20.400 --> 02:10:23.000
people when you go out in society your 11th house.


2629
02:10:24.300 --> 02:10:27.400
Has to do with how you deal when you're out in public


2630
02:10:27.400 --> 02:10:30.300
not public as like you versus the public


2631
02:10:30.300 --> 02:10:33.700
at large, but you within groups of people you walking


2632
02:10:33.700 --> 02:10:36.400
through Walmart and all those people being around you


2633
02:10:36.400 --> 02:10:37.500
that's 11th house.


2634
02:10:38.600 --> 02:10:41.300
You coming up to the cashier and there's five


2635
02:10:41.300 --> 02:10:44.900
people in line. It's Aquarius. It's Aquarius Uranus.


2636
02:10:44.900 --> 02:10:47.500
It's how you deal with it. A lot of people use this


2637
02:10:47.500 --> 02:10:50.500
energy and it's getting get off get out. And that's how it


2638
02:10:50.500 --> 02:10:53.300
plays out. It's a Detachment, especially if


2639
02:10:53.300 --> 02:10:56.500
you have this sitting naturally you get in there you act


2640
02:10:56.500 --> 02:10:59.300
independent you go there for what you're there for and you leave


2641
02:10:59.300 --> 02:11:02.800
if you have you know mercury in


2642
02:11:02.800 --> 02:11:03.600
here like I do actually


2643
02:11:05.700 --> 02:11:08.600
Mercury and Gemini in the 11th house you go and you you make


2644
02:11:08.600 --> 02:11:09.000
a good time.


2645
02:11:09.900 --> 02:11:12.700
You talk to people about their day. You're like hey, that's a


2646
02:11:12.700 --> 02:11:15.300
really cool outfit that you got on, you know, you talk to


2647
02:11:15.300 --> 02:11:18.400
people you make comments about them, especially since this opposite Uranus.


2648
02:11:18.400 --> 02:11:20.200
I pick and choose who I do that with.


2649
02:11:20.900 --> 02:11:23.300
But that type of energy is how it kind


2650
02:11:23.300 --> 02:11:27.600
of it changes and let's get into. Oh, yeah,


2651
02:11:27.600 --> 02:11:31.000
and then like it's it's also outward goals of


2652
02:11:30.100 --> 02:11:33.500
like creative expression as well. It's the opposite of


2653
02:11:33.500 --> 02:11:36.600
internal expression. It's outward what


2654
02:11:36.600 --> 02:11:39.200
I want. It's hope dreams and wishes. This is


2655
02:11:39.200 --> 02:11:42.200
all the the pipe dreams out there the things


2656
02:11:42.200 --> 02:11:43.100
almost


2657
02:11:44.100 --> 02:11:47.100
Almost idealistic, but that actually gets into the 12th house,


2658
02:11:47.100 --> 02:11:47.900
but it is you know.


2659
02:11:48.800 --> 02:11:51.600
What you want that is going to better be better for the


2660
02:11:51.600 --> 02:11:53.600
group better for the team better for everybody.


2661
02:11:54.800 --> 02:11:55.200
and then


2662
02:11:56.600 --> 02:11:59.400
12th house Pisces. It is


2663
02:11:59.400 --> 02:12:02.600
ruled by Neptune. This is the glyph and it's all about the subconscious and


2664
02:12:02.600 --> 02:12:06.100
the spiritual realm. It is literally the antithesis


2665
02:12:05.100 --> 02:12:08.600
of the sixth house, which is the material world. This


2666
02:12:08.600 --> 02:12:11.300
is Letting Go some people since we're talking


2667
02:12:11.300 --> 02:12:14.800
about spiritual practice get too involved in their Pisces energy


2668
02:12:14.800 --> 02:12:17.300
and they become too spiritual and


2669
02:12:17.300 --> 02:12:20.300
you see these people all the time where they're talking about where all


2670
02:12:20.300 --> 02:12:24.100
the sending to 5D and I'm taking all these herbal medicines


2671
02:12:23.100 --> 02:12:26.300
and I've done this and you know, we're all


2672
02:12:26.300 --> 02:12:29.200
aliens which also aliens is also in a


2673
02:12:30.300 --> 02:12:33.300
A uranium thing Aquarius rules aliens,


2674
02:12:33.300 --> 02:12:36.300
but it kind of rules this whole like we're not


2675
02:12:36.300 --> 02:12:39.500
supposed to be living in our body The Human Experience is


2676
02:12:39.500 --> 02:12:42.700
so yesterday. We're supposed to be astral traveling


2677
02:12:42.700 --> 02:12:45.200
and do it. That's that's somebody who's gone too far. That's


2678
02:12:45.200 --> 02:12:48.600
somebody who has left the balance of these sixth


2679
02:12:48.600 --> 02:12:51.200
and 12th houses here


2680
02:12:51.200 --> 02:12:55.100
and they're over here and they're running away. It's literally


2681
02:12:54.100 --> 02:12:57.500
the house of escapism is the 12th house.


2682
02:12:57.500 --> 02:13:00.600
They're running away from all of their work their problems


2683
02:13:00.600 --> 02:13:03.800
their day-to-day life their their sense


2684
02:13:03.800 --> 02:13:06.900
of Duty the responsibilities anything that ties them


2685
02:13:06.900 --> 02:13:09.100
to the physical material world. They're over here.


2686
02:13:09.100 --> 02:13:12.400
There's a balance that need that needs to be struck and a


2687
02:13:12.400 --> 02:13:13.600
lot of people myself.


2688
02:13:14.700 --> 02:13:17.000
Are two invested in the sixth house


2689
02:13:17.300 --> 02:13:20.700
in Virgo in Mercury energy where they can't they


2690
02:13:20.700 --> 02:13:23.700
don't connect to their subconscious. They don't connect to their to


2691
02:13:23.700 --> 02:13:26.400
God. They don't connect to the idea of any


2692
02:13:26.400 --> 02:13:29.300
sort of spirituality. And when you look at like I


2693
02:13:29.300 --> 02:13:32.200
said my house for instance, we're not talking about the nodes in this


2694
02:13:32.200 --> 02:13:35.200
class. But the South node is like your comfort zone. You're North notice


2695
02:13:35.200 --> 02:13:38.300
what you're supposed to attain mines in the sixth house. What I'm


2696
02:13:38.300 --> 02:13:41.500
supposed to gather is in the in the


2697
02:13:41.500 --> 02:13:44.200
12th house here and for most of my life, it


2698
02:13:44.200 --> 02:13:47.600
was work work work work. I talk a lot about the film production


2699
02:13:47.600 --> 02:13:51.600
company that I started in California that I


2700
02:13:51.600 --> 02:13:54.600
started when I was homeless and it was no nose


2701
02:13:54.600 --> 02:13:57.700
to the Grind pedal to the metal. That's I manifested


2702
02:13:57.700 --> 02:13:58.900
that it was everything was there.


2703
02:14:00.500 --> 02:14:03.200
And I I didn't sleep I didn't eat I didn't


2704
02:14:03.200 --> 02:14:06.500
do anything. I was just so connected to this. No sleep.


2705
02:14:06.500 --> 02:14:10.000
No taking care of myself. No compassion. Just


2706
02:14:09.800 --> 02:14:12.600
do do 22 hours


2707
02:14:12.600 --> 02:14:15.300
a day was the average sometimes 24 hours a


2708
02:14:15.300 --> 02:14:18.400
day sometimes 20 but 22 is the average no sleep just


2709
02:14:18.400 --> 02:14:21.100
doing it and I'm not the only person who's like that.


2710
02:14:21.100 --> 02:14:24.600
These are called Workaholics Workaholics tend not


2711
02:14:24.600 --> 02:14:27.500
to have a spiritual side. They tend to neglect it


2712
02:14:27.500 --> 02:14:30.800
and people who are into science and practical application of


2713
02:14:30.800 --> 02:14:34.100
the sixth house deny the twelfth


2714
02:14:33.100 --> 02:14:36.200
house. So a lot of scientists A lot of people


2715
02:14:36.200 --> 02:14:39.300
of service even people in the medical industry. They want to


2716
02:14:39.300 --> 02:14:42.600
know the real thing. They're they're not into holistic, which


2717
02:14:42.600 --> 02:14:45.100
is holistic is all so because it's good for Humanity is


2718
02:14:45.100 --> 02:14:48.400
is 11th and Aquarian and uranium, but


2719
02:14:49.300 --> 02:14:54.800
Things that are compassionate things that are like more spiritual when


2720
02:14:52.800 --> 02:14:55.100
someone has


2721
02:14:55.100 --> 02:14:58.600
a sickness and you have heavy Virgo placements but no 12th


2722
02:14:58.600 --> 02:15:01.100
or Pisces placements. You're gonna go into big Pharma you're gonna


2723
02:15:01.100 --> 02:15:04.400
go into how you can treat that person physically as opposed


2724
02:15:04.400 --> 02:15:07.800
to realizing sometimes the person just needs to get away and remove


2725
02:15:07.800 --> 02:15:08.800
themselves from stress.


2726
02:15:10.800 --> 02:15:13.600
Sometimes they need a spiritual practice and meditate that's all


2727
02:15:13.600 --> 02:15:17.400
12 that cure so much is by lowering your stress, but


2728
02:15:16.400 --> 02:15:19.700
people with heavy six house placements Virgo.


2729
02:15:19.700 --> 02:15:21.900
They have a hard time accepting that.


2730
02:15:22.900 --> 02:15:25.300
Pisces glyph looks like this. It is


2731
02:15:25.300 --> 02:15:29.500
the fishies. It is a mutable Duality just


2732
02:15:28.500 --> 02:15:31.300
like Gemini Gemini Pisces. It's


2733
02:15:31.300 --> 02:15:35.300
ironic. They Square each other because they're both mutable and they're


2734
02:15:34.300 --> 02:15:37.200
both do they both have a duality to


2735
02:15:37.200 --> 02:15:40.600
them? This is the symbol for Neptune which rules it. It's all about water.


2736
02:15:40.600 --> 02:15:43.300
It's all about like Atlantis and that


2737
02:15:43.300 --> 02:15:46.600
kind of theme there. It's all about your intuition. Not


2738
02:15:46.600 --> 02:15:49.100
as like a mother's Intuition or like gut feeling


2739
02:15:49.100 --> 02:15:52.300
but more like intuition messages that come through spirit and


2740
02:15:52.300 --> 02:15:55.700
you don't know where they came from. But you have this Divine connection


2741
02:15:55.700 --> 02:15:58.900
that you just kind of, you know what to do. It's not


2742
02:15:58.900 --> 02:16:01.300
because you thought about it's just because it came in people who


2743
02:16:01.300 --> 02:16:04.300
have like mercury in Pisces mercury in 12th house.


2744
02:16:04.300 --> 02:16:06.000
They tend to be able to channel.


2745
02:16:07.600 --> 02:16:10.500
messages from outside themselves they tend to be able to sit there and write


2746
02:16:10.500 --> 02:16:11.400
and


2747
02:16:12.500 --> 02:16:15.500
It just flows through them and honestly just using my own chart again


2748
02:16:15.500 --> 02:16:18.500
my Mercury it does


2749
02:16:18.500 --> 02:16:21.400
that too in a different way? My Mercury is here


2750
02:16:21.400 --> 02:16:24.600
opposing Uranus and then Neptune is


2751
02:16:24.600 --> 02:16:28.700
right here and then Neptune is sex tile


2752
02:16:28.700 --> 02:16:31.700
the ruler of my 12th house. So when


2753
02:16:31.700 --> 02:16:34.300
I used to sit and write scripts, I used to write them very fast. That's


2754
02:16:34.300 --> 02:16:35.800
the Uranian energy it took me.


2755
02:16:36.600 --> 02:16:39.500
Two days to write the first full-length movie script that


2756
02:16:39.500 --> 02:16:42.600
we got all that funding for and then my wife


2757
02:16:42.600 --> 02:16:45.200
tore it down for five days. And then I rewrote it in five days.


2758
02:16:45.200 --> 02:16:48.200
So you're talking about 12 total days to write a full feature length script


2759
02:16:48.200 --> 02:16:51.100
and it just does this I see it in my head and I just


2760
02:16:51.100 --> 02:16:54.700
write it and it's just channeling through that's Pisces energy.


2761
02:16:55.600 --> 02:16:58.600
Pisces rules intangible creativity


2762
02:16:59.500 --> 02:17:02.500
intangible creativity has to do with the types


2763
02:17:02.500 --> 02:17:05.300
of creative talents that come through you


2764
02:17:05.300 --> 02:17:09.300
that you can't touch music dance anything


2765
02:17:08.300 --> 02:17:11.500
that's inspiring that kind of connects you


2766
02:17:11.500 --> 02:17:14.800
on a very soul level of even


2767
02:17:14.800 --> 02:17:16.700
though painting painting is like a combination.


2768
02:17:17.800 --> 02:17:21.000
Of especially watercolor combination of Pisces


2769
02:17:20.200 --> 02:17:23.700
and Venus energy Neptune Venus Pisces tars


2770
02:17:23.700 --> 02:17:24.700
energy here.


2771
02:17:25.700 --> 02:17:28.800
We pretty much all know that Neptune rules spirituality when


2772
02:17:28.800 --> 02:17:29.900
it's in tandem with.


2773
02:17:30.800 --> 02:17:33.200
When it's in tandem with Jupiter, it tends


2774
02:17:33.200 --> 02:17:36.700
to make a religious person. So it's their beliefs with spirituality


2775
02:17:36.700 --> 02:17:39.400
and they're more of the Christ Consciousness and they


2776
02:17:39.400 --> 02:17:42.300
kind of go that route with it. So when you see somebody who


2777
02:17:42.300 --> 02:17:45.100
has that connection, usually there's an element of


2778
02:17:45.100 --> 02:17:48.200
religion like hardcore religion in there.


2779
02:17:49.300 --> 02:17:52.400
Especially if it then ties in with Saturn in some


2780
02:17:52.400 --> 02:17:52.400
way.


2781
02:17:53.300 --> 02:17:56.600
The fishies are also chameleons. They tend


2782
02:17:56.600 --> 02:18:00.000
to be able to blend in with everything because they dissolve The


2783
02:17:59.400 --> 02:18:03.200
Human Experience. So they just kind of become anyone


2784
02:18:02.200 --> 02:18:04.100
who has Pisces in the


2785
02:18:05.600 --> 02:18:09.400
seventh house Neptune in the seventh house Venus or


2786
02:18:09.400 --> 02:18:12.500
Libra in the 12th house. You can easily get


2787
02:18:12.500 --> 02:18:15.200
lost because Neptune is all about the haze the fog


2788
02:18:15.200 --> 02:18:18.100
the loss the unknown you can


2789
02:18:18.100 --> 02:18:21.700
get lost in your relationships. Meaning you really detach from


2790
02:18:21.700 --> 02:18:24.100
yourself in a way that is unintentional and you


2791
02:18:24.100 --> 02:18:27.600
become your partner. You become fused with your partner. You basically are


2792
02:18:27.600 --> 02:18:28.900
subsumed into your relationship.


2793
02:18:30.200 --> 02:18:33.700
Let's see Drake dreams when you have dreams, that's


2794
02:18:33.700 --> 02:18:36.400
all how you dream how it's connected is all


2795
02:18:36.400 --> 02:18:38.000
your 12th house and 12th house ruler.


2796
02:18:38.700 --> 02:18:42.200
Escapism alcoholism substance abuse


2797
02:18:41.200 --> 02:18:44.200
is a combination of actually Scorpio and


2798
02:18:44.200 --> 02:18:47.200
Neptune but alcoholism in terms of why you're


2799
02:18:47.200 --> 02:18:50.500
doing it escaping and water itself. So


2800
02:18:50.500 --> 02:18:53.000
like if you see Neptune, I've told a few people when you've seen


2801
02:18:53.500 --> 02:18:57.200
Neptune in your fourth house or near your IC or maybe


2802
02:18:56.200 --> 02:18:59.200
Neptune cancer. You need to live


2803
02:18:59.200 --> 02:19:02.300
near water. You need to have water either a lake a


2804
02:19:02.300 --> 02:19:05.500
stream a pond the ocean a golf


2805
02:19:05.500 --> 02:19:08.700
or a water feature in your home is extremely


2806
02:19:08.700 --> 02:19:09.300
important for you.


2807
02:19:11.500 --> 02:19:14.500
Undoing behind the scenes where your


2808
02:19:14.500 --> 02:19:17.100
12th house is is what is not in the


2809
02:19:17.100 --> 02:19:20.200
Forefront of your life. It all operates behind the scenes and when we're


2810
02:19:20.200 --> 02:19:23.400
talking about career, it's literally the person who works on


2811
02:19:23.400 --> 02:19:26.600
the career who makes everything work, but nobody knows that they did it they


2812
02:19:26.600 --> 02:19:29.500
work nobody sees them and that's where they shine


2813
02:19:29.500 --> 02:19:33.300
they get everything done in the everything works. But because


2814
02:19:32.300 --> 02:19:34.500
they're not there.


2815
02:19:35.400 --> 02:19:38.600
Nobody sees then it's like magic which


2816
02:19:38.600 --> 02:19:41.400
Neptune rules magic as well because Neptune rules


2817
02:19:41.400 --> 02:19:41.900
illusion.


2818
02:19:43.400 --> 02:19:46.900
anything that's medical intangibly so viruses


2819
02:19:46.900 --> 02:19:49.400
which is why the lockdowns and


2820
02:19:49.400 --> 02:19:52.900
everything happened has to do with the fact that we were moved


2821
02:19:52.900 --> 02:19:55.200
into the age of here's a


2822
02:19:55.200 --> 02:19:58.800
fun fact, by the way, the Civil War for the United States was


2823
02:19:58.800 --> 02:20:02.000
the exact moment cyclically speaking as the


2824
02:20:01.800 --> 02:20:05.200
lockdowns the difference was that the age


2825
02:20:04.200 --> 02:20:05.800
of Pisces


2826
02:20:07.100 --> 02:20:11.700
for the Civil War was the age of Pisces era of Aquarius phase


2827
02:20:10.700 --> 02:20:13.100
of Gemini going into the phase of


2828
02:20:13.100 --> 02:20:17.200
cancer. When all that happened in our timeline. It


2829
02:20:16.200 --> 02:20:20.000
was Pisces Pisces Gemini cancer.


2830
02:20:19.400 --> 02:20:22.400
The difference was the era. So instead


2831
02:20:22.400 --> 02:20:25.400
of it being about states rights and which are the entities


2832
02:20:25.400 --> 02:20:28.300
humanitarianism the the theme of


2833
02:20:28.300 --> 02:20:31.400
slavery the community and everything being out in


2834
02:20:31.400 --> 02:20:34.100
society literally two teams against each other with Gemini.


2835
02:20:35.300 --> 02:20:38.300
It became no one knows what's


2836
02:20:38.300 --> 02:20:41.500
really happening Pisces energy. Nobody knows


2837
02:20:41.500 --> 02:20:44.100
where it started. Nobody knows where it came from. Nobody knows


2838
02:20:44.100 --> 02:20:47.300
what it really is. Every single news article is something


2839
02:20:47.300 --> 02:20:50.200
different. Here's what it is. Here's what it does here. The dangers. Here's


2840
02:20:50.200 --> 02:20:53.600
this no one knew for sure what it was. It's also


2841
02:20:53.600 --> 02:20:56.900
medical. It was a virus illness and


2842
02:20:56.900 --> 02:20:59.100
the illusion of illness and then


2843
02:20:59.100 --> 02:21:02.300
bring in the current current things of authority and power and control


2844
02:21:02.300 --> 02:21:06.500
and then isolation. This is literally quarantining. This


2845
02:21:06.500 --> 02:21:09.500
was literally six feet and all


2846
02:21:09.500 --> 02:21:12.100
that. That was this because it was Pisces. A lot of people


2847
02:21:12.100 --> 02:21:15.300
don't realize that's literally the Civil War cycled over


2848
02:21:15.300 --> 02:21:18.200
but now it's this and it became a civil


2849
02:21:18.200 --> 02:21:20.600
war. It's a different Civil War it was based off of this.


2850
02:21:21.400 --> 02:21:24.400
Our country the world is in a divide and


2851
02:21:24.400 --> 02:21:27.600
now we're in cancer healing this is the Reconstruction Era


2852
02:21:27.600 --> 02:21:29.200
but with Pisces themes.


2853
02:21:30.100 --> 02:21:33.100
Right after the Civil War post Civil War that's where we're in


2854
02:21:33.100 --> 02:21:36.400
now. This is why a lot of people are getting into spiritual healing. This is


2855
02:21:36.400 --> 02:21:39.400
why people are trying to find their tribe. This is why we're all trying to piece everything


2856
02:21:39.400 --> 02:21:42.600
together. We're moving forward. This is because it's cyclical.


2857
02:21:42.600 --> 02:21:45.400
This is us moving forward in that nature. So that's


2858
02:21:45.400 --> 02:21:48.200
Pisces energy here again 12th house energy,


2859
02:21:48.200 --> 02:21:51.400
there's more to Pisces, but it has a lot to and


2860
02:21:51.400 --> 02:21:54.500
again, it's our connection to God. It's literally our connection to Spirit as


2861
02:21:54.500 --> 02:21:54.700
well.


2862
02:21:55.800 --> 02:21:59.100
12th house. Yes, it's mental illness. So Danny asking


2863
02:21:58.100 --> 02:22:01.600
about the 12th house in Psych hospitals. It


2864
02:22:01.600 --> 02:22:04.900
does rule institutions, which is part of this isolation. So


2865
02:22:04.900 --> 02:22:07.300
like psych wards anything that has


2866
02:22:07.300 --> 02:22:10.200
isolation jails. It


2867
02:22:10.200 --> 02:22:11.100
also rules jail.


2868
02:22:12.100 --> 02:22:15.200
In the reason why you can't be with somebody usually when


2869
02:22:15.200 --> 02:22:18.500
you're looking in a chart and you see Neptune attached to like the sun or


2870
02:22:18.500 --> 02:22:20.900
Capricorn or in the fourth house. It's


2871
02:22:21.800 --> 02:22:24.300
there was something about that person that wasn't there


2872
02:22:24.300 --> 02:22:27.300
either they weren't there or they were an alcoholic or they


2873
02:22:27.300 --> 02:22:30.300
escaped a lot or there. It


2874
02:22:30.300 --> 02:22:34.000
could have been that there was a divorce involved and it


2875
02:22:33.100 --> 02:22:37.300
could have been that they were creative and musical too. But it's usually


2876
02:22:36.300 --> 02:22:39.500
a multiple things within the same theme


2877
02:22:39.500 --> 02:22:41.400
within the same sign that we see there.


2878
02:22:42.200 --> 02:22:46.000
So it does rule mental illness as well. So it it literally


2879
02:22:45.000 --> 02:22:46.800
opposes.


2880
02:22:48.100 --> 02:22:51.900
You're opposing Mercury and you're basically saying the


2881
02:22:51.900 --> 02:22:55.100
dissolution of mentality is


2882
02:22:54.100 --> 02:22:57.200
how you get mental illness out of the 12th house


2883
02:22:57.200 --> 02:23:00.300
and it has to do with the subconscious everything ends up going into a place


2884
02:23:00.300 --> 02:23:03.400
that you can't access anymore. That's the mental illness. It's not


2885
02:23:03.400 --> 02:23:03.700
that you're


2886
02:23:04.900 --> 02:23:07.300
it's I mean, that's the way that it functions


2887
02:23:07.300 --> 02:23:10.800
spiritually speaking. It's that you cannot access your mind.


2888
02:23:11.800 --> 02:23:14.400
And you have to be careful with this energy because it also


2889
02:23:14.400 --> 02:23:16.700
has to do with memory loss and things like that.


2890
02:23:21.900 --> 02:23:24.400
What in your chart showed you you were inclined to


2891
02:23:24.400 --> 02:23:25.500
do astrology?


2892
02:23:28.600 --> 02:23:31.300
all right, so in my chart


2893
02:23:32.100 --> 02:23:35.500
I've always been into it. It's sitting


2894
02:23:35.500 --> 02:23:39.700
right here, like passion having a Passion creative that


2895
02:23:38.700 --> 02:23:41.800
has to do with this and then with we're


2896
02:23:41.800 --> 02:23:44.300
gonna get into orbs of influence in another class, but with


2897
02:23:44.300 --> 02:23:47.400
it being at one degree and 50 minutes, it's orb of


2898
02:23:47.400 --> 02:23:50.600
influence. If you I'm doing imaginary circle of how


2899
02:23:50.600 --> 02:23:53.300
many degrees it has you can


2900
02:23:53.300 --> 02:23:56.600
see that my cursor is pulling into the next


2901
02:23:56.600 --> 02:23:59.900
house which means it's pulling uranium Sagittarian


2902
02:23:59.900 --> 02:24:02.100
energy into the fourth house


2903
02:24:02.100 --> 02:24:02.200
here.


2904
02:24:03.100 --> 02:24:06.200
Which means it's also pulling uranium energy into the fourth house


2905
02:24:06.200 --> 02:24:09.300
of Scorpio. So you have to read that as well, but it's


2906
02:24:09.300 --> 02:24:12.300
pulling Sagittarius energy into


2907
02:24:12.300 --> 02:24:14.500
the fourth house through Uranus.


2908
02:24:15.100 --> 02:24:18.600
This is where it gets complicated. This is where towards the end of the course. You're


2909
02:24:18.600 --> 02:24:21.500
going to learn how to read all that and see how that is, but Sagittarius


2910
02:24:21.500 --> 02:24:22.800
like I said co-rules.


2911
02:24:25.300 --> 02:24:28.500
Astrology, here's the spirituality aspect and


2912
02:24:28.500 --> 02:24:31.300
here is the Aquarian aspect this right


2913
02:24:31.300 --> 02:24:34.200
here is the astrology. I am also it's in


2914
02:24:34.200 --> 02:24:38.100
the fifth house and I'm a Leo Rising. Also the spiritual


2915
02:24:37.100 --> 02:24:40.400
part is opposite my chart


2916
02:24:40.400 --> 02:24:43.800
ruler the ruler of Leo. So the ruler


2917
02:24:43.800 --> 02:24:47.400
of your first house by the way is called Your


2918
02:24:47.400 --> 02:24:50.300
Chart ruler. It is the most significant Planet because


2919
02:24:50.300 --> 02:24:53.600
it has to do with your body your physical actions how you


2920
02:24:53.600 --> 02:24:56.500
approach the world because it's Mars ruled, but for


2921
02:24:56.500 --> 02:24:57.400
me, it's the Sun.


2922
02:24:58.200 --> 02:25:01.500
And that only applies to Leo everyone else has whatever their ruler


2923
02:25:01.500 --> 02:25:01.600
is.


2924
02:25:03.400 --> 02:25:06.300
Whatever this ruler is. So if you have Gemini in


2925
02:25:06.300 --> 02:25:09.200
the first house Mercury is your chart ruler if you have cancer in the


2926
02:25:09.200 --> 02:25:12.300
first house, it's the moon so on and so forth Scorpio, it's


2927
02:25:12.300 --> 02:25:14.000
Pluto. That's how that works.


2928
02:25:15.800 --> 02:25:18.200
But this is what it is and really what it came down to is


2929
02:25:18.200 --> 02:25:21.200
acceptance. It came down to my North Node


2930
02:25:21.200 --> 02:25:24.600
in the 12th house and accepting this energy and balancing


2931
02:25:24.600 --> 02:25:27.500
out the Neptune not using Neptune as escapism


2932
02:25:27.500 --> 02:25:30.100
by avoiding the ego and avoiding my passions and


2933
02:25:30.100 --> 02:25:33.500
and becoming so unhappy that I became an alcoholic which


2934
02:25:33.500 --> 02:25:36.200
has happened a few times in my life. Although it's


2935
02:25:36.200 --> 02:25:39.400
not a through line. I was a light Bloomer


2936
02:25:39.400 --> 02:25:42.500
when it comes to my drinking career at almost


2937
02:25:42.500 --> 02:25:45.500
22 because everybody I knew was like 10 years


2938
02:25:45.500 --> 02:25:48.700
earlier than that or you know, something like


2939
02:25:48.700 --> 02:25:48.800
that.


2940
02:25:49.700 --> 02:25:52.000
And I quit drinking when I was.


2941
02:25:53.400 --> 02:25:54.400
33


2942
02:25:55.700 --> 02:25:58.500
I was 33. So I only drank for 11 total years


2943
02:25:58.500 --> 02:26:01.900
and I didn't drink the whole time. I took years off because it


2944
02:26:01.900 --> 02:26:04.500
was a balance. I just kept going back and forth with you know,


2945
02:26:04.500 --> 02:26:07.100
when I was happy. I didn't drink when I was like


2946
02:26:07.100 --> 02:26:10.900
not sure and I was like with the wrong friends I


2947
02:26:10.900 --> 02:26:13.400
drank and then when I was happy again and


2948
02:26:13.400 --> 02:26:16.400
had my nose to the Grind I was doing everything I needed to do I


2949
02:26:16.400 --> 02:26:19.200
didn't drink and then there it became a point


2950
02:26:19.200 --> 02:26:22.200
where I realized that this was taking over and it became because of


2951
02:26:22.200 --> 02:26:26.000
Sagittarius is Jupiter old it became obsessive and


2952
02:26:25.200 --> 02:26:28.800
it became like way too much Jupiter's rulers


2953
02:26:28.800 --> 02:26:31.100
over here in the fourth house again, we're gonna teach you how to


2954
02:26:31.100 --> 02:26:34.500
connect all the dots later understanding the


2955
02:26:34.500 --> 02:26:36.800
basic energies is what is important.


2956
02:26:42.300 --> 02:26:45.400
Okay, I answered that I am that's what I'm gonna stop for this


2957
02:26:45.400 --> 02:26:48.600
course. I'm going to do Q&amp;A because I'm over my two hours. I know


2958
02:26:48.600 --> 02:26:51.900
what I'm gonna start with on the next one. We're gonna talk more about the luminaries the


2959
02:26:51.900 --> 02:26:54.400
four angles. We're gonna get into the North and


2960
02:26:54.400 --> 02:26:57.200
South node talk more about rulerships and


2961
02:26:57.200 --> 02:27:00.200
deccans in the second class and orbs of


2962
02:27:00.200 --> 02:27:03.100
influence. That's gonna be the major thing. This is a


2963
02:27:03.100 --> 02:27:06.000
step-by-step course so that you're gonna take everything here. You're going to


2964
02:27:06.300 --> 02:27:09.100
implement it. Obviously, I'll also be going back during the second


2965
02:27:09.100 --> 02:27:12.100
class to revisit topics of the first class so that I


2966
02:27:12.100 --> 02:27:14.200
can bring those forward so they all make sense.


2967
02:27:15.300 --> 02:27:18.400
How do natural house rulers play out in non areas Rising


2968
02:27:18.400 --> 02:27:19.100
that's good. So


2969
02:27:20.400 --> 02:27:23.800
Natural rulers are there for informative


2970
02:27:23.800 --> 02:27:26.700
reasons only meaning they're connected. But


2971
02:27:26.700 --> 02:27:28.800
if I'm a Leo Rising, which I am.


2972
02:27:29.900 --> 02:27:32.300
Aries does not rule my first house in


2973
02:27:32.300 --> 02:27:35.700
any any shape fashion or form areas has


2974
02:27:35.700 --> 02:27:37.400
nothing to do with my first house.


2975
02:27:38.400 --> 02:27:42.100
However, Aries properties rule the


2976
02:27:41.100 --> 02:27:44.200
same thing as the first house. They're


2977
02:27:44.200 --> 02:27:47.600
just they don't include my ascendant. So when I go to Aries, I


2978
02:27:47.600 --> 02:27:51.900
go to all those things that we talked about being Aries related


2979
02:27:51.900 --> 02:27:54.500
sense of self Independence body physical


2980
02:27:54.500 --> 02:27:57.400
appearance, you know action the things


2981
02:27:57.400 --> 02:28:00.500
that I do naturally here. I have a


2982
02:28:00.500 --> 02:28:03.400
double dose of it because Aries sits up in the ninth house. So this is


2983
02:28:03.400 --> 02:28:06.200
why I'm a teacher but also my ascendant sits in


2984
02:28:06.200 --> 02:28:09.300
again. We're not talking about it yet, but in the Jupiter deck in


2985
02:28:09.900 --> 02:28:12.100
Of Leo and I do want to point out that


2986
02:28:12.100 --> 02:28:15.300
it's Deccan and not Deacon. I've heard


2987
02:28:15.300 --> 02:28:18.600
a lot of people say Deacon and I'm not sure why it is definitely Decon


2988
02:28:18.600 --> 02:28:21.200
as in Deca as in 10, it is


2989
02:28:21.200 --> 02:28:24.600
every 10 degrees is a Decon. So if


2990
02:28:24.600 --> 02:28:27.300
you've heard it the other way, it's not right Deca meaning


2991
02:28:27.300 --> 02:28:29.500
ten decagon 10 sides.


2992
02:28:30.400 --> 02:28:33.400
Whatever decathlon, you know


2993
02:28:33.400 --> 02:28:33.900
ten events.


2994
02:28:34.700 --> 02:28:36.900
But this is all about this so.


2995
02:28:37.700 --> 02:28:40.400
The first house is not ruled by Aries, but


2996
02:28:40.400 --> 02:28:42.300
it is it's natural ruler meaning.


2997
02:28:43.100 --> 02:28:46.400
When someone is an Aries Rising everything seems to


2998
02:28:46.400 --> 02:28:49.700
line up their first house and their house itself. What


2999
02:28:49.700 --> 02:28:52.900
they do is just very straightforward their


3000
02:28:52.900 --> 02:28:55.300
second house. Then becomes Taurus their sense of value is


3001
02:28:55.300 --> 02:28:58.400
just normal, they value things of value. They value food. They


3002
02:28:58.400 --> 02:29:01.400
value things that are luxurious they like it's


3003
02:29:01.400 --> 02:29:04.200
just very straightforward and then the planets and


3004
02:29:04.200 --> 02:29:07.300
the ruler ships then create the uniqueness within


3005
02:29:07.300 --> 02:29:10.800
each chart. But in Aries Rising, has it very straightforward in


3006
02:29:10.800 --> 02:29:13.200
this lifetime and then the Libra Rising


3007
02:29:13.200 --> 02:29:13.900
has it flipped.


3008
02:29:14.600 --> 02:29:17.400
So everything you think it's the other way around and then you add in


3009
02:29:17.400 --> 02:29:19.300
the ruler ships from there.


3010
02:29:20.500 --> 02:29:23.400
Please put together a PDF. I would like a copy


3011
02:29:23.400 --> 02:29:25.200
to study I will take.


3012
02:29:27.200 --> 02:29:30.700
This stuff here and I have


3013
02:29:30.700 --> 02:29:33.400
it in order. So I literally just pull a PDF and


3014
02:29:33.400 --> 02:29:34.700
put it up on learnworlds.


3015
02:29:35.600 --> 02:29:38.500
And then eventually this will all be on our Mystic Rebels


3016
02:29:38.500 --> 02:29:42.000
platform. So if you're if you're watching this and you're


3017
02:29:41.400 --> 02:29:44.300
on learn worlds, we will be moving it to Mystic


3018
02:29:44.300 --> 02:29:48.400
rebels in the next few months. Once that's up and running and ready learn


3019
02:29:47.400 --> 02:29:50.400
worlds. I'm doing this separately from


3020
02:29:50.400 --> 02:29:53.200
there because they had a bunch of issues logging in some of


3021
02:29:53.200 --> 02:29:56.200
you know what I'm talking about. So I apologize for having to


3022
02:29:56.200 --> 02:29:59.000
send like multiple emails each time with the different link. I'm glad


3023
02:29:59.100 --> 02:30:00.200
you guys all made it and you're all here.


3024
02:30:01.500 --> 02:30:03.700
But I will get that together.


3025
02:30:05.100 --> 02:30:08.700
Let's see Danny. What about somebody who has a lot of 12th


3026
02:30:08.700 --> 02:30:11.400
house placements. I feel like it's so misunderstood. I don't understand if


3027
02:30:11.400 --> 02:30:12.200
it's good or bad.


3028
02:30:12.900 --> 02:30:16.200
If you have placements and then house, let me say I


3029
02:30:15.200 --> 02:30:18.300
don't believe there's a such thing as a bad chart.


3030
02:30:18.300 --> 02:30:21.300
I don't think it matters where your energy is. And this


3031
02:30:21.300 --> 02:30:24.800
is why I think I don't believe in planetary dignities again. A


3032
02:30:24.800 --> 02:30:27.100
planetary dignity is talking about if Mars is in


3033
02:30:27.100 --> 02:30:30.400
the first house or I'm sorry. If it's an Aries that


3034
02:30:30.400 --> 02:30:34.500
it's that it is that it is home and domicile if


3035
02:30:33.500 --> 02:30:36.200
it is in Libra that


3036
02:30:36.200 --> 02:30:39.800
it's in detriment if it's in other houses that it is exalted. You've


3037
02:30:39.800 --> 02:30:42.100
heard that term it's exalted. I don't


3038
02:30:42.100 --> 02:30:45.500
believe that I think that term is outmoded and


3039
02:30:45.500 --> 02:30:48.100
Antiquated and maybe that's just all the Aquarian energy in me.


3040
02:30:49.300 --> 02:30:50.600
But I also don't think it's fair.


3041
02:30:51.700 --> 02:30:54.400
I don't think it's fair when somebody reads a chart. It's again. It's


3042
02:30:54.400 --> 02:30:58.300
like The Vedic astrology sidereal astrology traditional Hellenistic


3043
02:30:57.300 --> 02:30:58.600
astrology.


3044
02:30:59.300 --> 02:31:02.200
Viewpoint that you're focusing so much on the


3045
02:31:02.200 --> 02:31:05.200
negative in the bad and I just don't see it playing out that way I don't


3046
02:31:05.200 --> 02:31:09.000
see Venus and Taurus or


3047
02:31:08.200 --> 02:31:12.100
the moon in Taurus rather playing out any better


3048
02:31:11.100 --> 02:31:14.500
or different than the moon in Aries. You


3049
02:31:14.500 --> 02:31:17.300
just have to understand the energies one is not better than the


3050
02:31:17.300 --> 02:31:20.100
other one is not exalted. Although my wife would say


3051
02:31:20.100 --> 02:31:23.500
otherwise because she has a moon in Taurus. There's nothing about


3052
02:31:23.500 --> 02:31:26.500
the way that it plays out that makes it assault exalted a


3053
02:31:26.500 --> 02:31:27.300
moon in Taurus.


3054
02:31:28.100 --> 02:31:29.600
That is in conjunct.


3055
02:31:30.600 --> 02:31:32.000
your son


3056
02:31:32.600 --> 02:31:35.300
can be a very very difficult placement. There's nothing


3057
02:31:35.300 --> 02:31:38.200
exalted about a queen Kong's from your moon to your son


3058
02:31:38.200 --> 02:31:41.500
just because one of them is supposedly exalted so I


3059
02:31:41.500 --> 02:31:44.200
don't believe in that. I don't like it. I don't like the negativity of it


3060
02:31:44.200 --> 02:31:47.200
because you look at your own chart. You're like why I have nothing exalted and


3061
02:31:47.200 --> 02:31:50.200
I have everything in detriment and then it sets this mindset that


3062
02:31:50.200 --> 02:31:53.600
doesn't even play out that way people with energies in


3063
02:31:53.600 --> 02:31:54.400
the 12th house.


3064
02:31:55.100 --> 02:31:58.300
It sits in your subconscious. You usually don't have access you have


3065
02:31:58.300 --> 02:32:01.200
to go seek it but it's also behind the scenes energy.


3066
02:32:01.200 --> 02:32:04.100
It can be tough for someone who has let's say


3067
02:32:04.100 --> 02:32:07.500
let's say the sun is in gemini or the sun's


3068
02:32:07.500 --> 02:32:08.600
in Leo or sons in.


3069
02:32:10.500 --> 02:32:13.300
Libra even and that's in the 12th house.


3070
02:32:13.300 --> 02:32:16.600
The 12th house is very you're not seen. It's almost


3071
02:32:16.600 --> 02:32:19.400
like the eighth house. They're both hidden in different ways. This


3072
02:32:19.400 --> 02:32:22.400
one's more subconscious behind the scenes kind of


3073
02:32:22.400 --> 02:32:25.200
back burner energy. The eighth house is more


3074
02:32:25.200 --> 02:32:28.400
hidden intentionally secretive energy a little


3075
02:32:28.400 --> 02:32:29.600
bit more shady, I guess.


3076
02:32:32.100 --> 02:32:35.700
or you have to really dig deep to bring it out when it's


3077
02:32:35.700 --> 02:32:36.300
in the


3078
02:32:37.300 --> 02:32:40.300
a twelfth house like when it's in Libra. It's like your


3079
02:32:40.300 --> 02:32:40.700
relationships.


3080
02:32:42.100 --> 02:32:45.600
Romance in relationships takes a back seat when it's


3081
02:32:45.600 --> 02:32:48.100
like sun and Leo, it's like you want to be seen and you want to be the


3082
02:32:48.100 --> 02:32:51.100
spotlight, but you aren't you're only the spotlight when you're by yourself.


3083
02:32:52.500 --> 02:32:55.200
Because you're in isolation and you're doing all your creative now, you can use


3084
02:32:55.200 --> 02:32:58.300
that some people with other placements that go with it. They enjoy that


3085
02:32:58.300 --> 02:33:01.300
energy because they they dance when like they dance


3086
02:33:01.300 --> 02:33:04.300
like nobody's looking because nobody's looking because no one's there.


3087
02:33:04.300 --> 02:33:07.700
They do like sewing in our art


3088
02:33:07.700 --> 02:33:10.300
and creative creative expression and creativity


3089
02:33:10.300 --> 02:33:11.900
things that are of a creative nature.


3090
02:33:13.900 --> 02:33:16.300
They do that like on their own Aries Rising,


3091
02:33:16.300 --> 02:33:19.600
honestly, unless Neptune's place in different spot music is


3092
02:33:19.600 --> 02:33:22.700
like their thing. They like to listen to music music. It's


3093
02:33:22.700 --> 02:33:25.300
music. It's not really a career. It's not something anything more


3094
02:33:25.300 --> 02:33:27.100
than I listen to it when I'm alone.


3095
02:33:27.900 --> 02:33:30.200
Or I you know, I meditate with music, you know,


3096
02:33:30.200 --> 02:33:33.100
that's an Aries rising. And again, it depends on where Neptune is.


3097
02:33:36.100 --> 02:33:39.900
When are we going to talk about manifesting? We are going to get to manifesting towards


3098
02:33:39.900 --> 02:33:43.400
the end of the course manifesting in


3099
02:33:42.400 --> 02:33:45.300
terms of astrology has to do with understanding the


3100
02:33:45.300 --> 02:33:50.000
energies and then being able to use them manifestation within


3101
02:33:48.100 --> 02:33:51.400
astrology is


3102
02:33:51.400 --> 02:33:54.900
saying I know what this is and I know the let's say


3103
02:33:54.900 --> 02:33:57.900
we're talking about the Sun or Leo or


3104
02:33:57.900 --> 02:33:58.700
the fifth house.


3105
02:33:59.500 --> 02:34:02.500
And we know all of these things and there's more to it.


3106
02:34:02.500 --> 02:34:05.500
These are like the main things but we know how this can


3107
02:34:05.500 --> 02:34:08.500
play out and you know, it's like pride and


3108
02:34:08.500 --> 02:34:11.400
ego and drama and how do we turn it around so that


3109
02:34:11.400 --> 02:34:14.800
instead of Pride and ego is humility or


3110
02:34:14.800 --> 02:34:17.200
it becomes more creative expression, but


3111
02:34:17.200 --> 02:34:21.400
I temper my pride and my ego I'm proud but it's


3112
02:34:21.400 --> 02:34:24.200
not egotistical. I I don't


3113
02:34:24.200 --> 02:34:27.700
overdo the pleasure. I turn just the pleasure maybe selfish


3114
02:34:27.700 --> 02:34:30.200
pleasure into romance instead of having too much


3115
02:34:30.200 --> 02:34:33.500
fun all the time. I try to include it and just have a child like nature


3116
02:34:33.500 --> 02:34:36.300
you temper everything you balance it and then you use that


3117
02:34:36.300 --> 02:34:39.200
energy. That's what the manifestation part is. And that's


3118
02:34:39.200 --> 02:34:43.600
later in the course once I get to making sure everybody understands what


3119
02:34:42.600 --> 02:34:44.400
all this is about.


3120
02:34:45.700 --> 02:34:48.200
Can you review Erica? Can you review


3121
02:34:48.200 --> 02:34:51.100
how to locate houses in your chart? I'm looking at my chart and I can't


3122
02:34:51.100 --> 02:34:54.200
seem to find it right in the center. So if


3123
02:34:54.200 --> 02:34:57.700
you've pulled up astro.com right in the center are


3124
02:34:57.700 --> 02:35:00.200
the house numbers one, two, three, four, five six seven and


3125
02:35:00.200 --> 02:35:00.800
when your house


3126
02:35:01.700 --> 02:35:05.200
once you get used to it, you know that the you're using


3127
02:35:05.200 --> 02:35:08.700
whole science health system that the one that's sitting here this line right


3128
02:35:08.700 --> 02:35:11.300
below. It is the first house the line that


3129
02:35:11.300 --> 02:35:14.600
goes straight down right to the right is the fourth house one four


3130
02:35:14.600 --> 02:35:17.100
seven and ten, we're gonna get into that in the next


3131
02:35:17.100 --> 02:35:20.300
class. But those are your angles the seventh house is here


3132
02:35:20.300 --> 02:35:23.300
that the house that goes here towards the West


3133
02:35:23.300 --> 02:35:26.400
is over here. I'm going to get into your


3134
02:35:26.400 --> 02:35:29.200
ascendant next time. This is the East this is


3135
02:35:29.200 --> 02:35:32.300
the West that is over here. That is Libra number seven


3136
02:35:32.300 --> 02:35:34.200
and the one that goes straight up and down.


3137
02:35:35.300 --> 02:35:38.300
Keep going counterclockwise is 10 but in the center is


3138
02:35:38.300 --> 02:35:39.500
1 through 10 there.


3139
02:35:42.500 --> 02:35:45.600
Does the little r next to Mercury mean Mercury


3140
02:35:45.600 --> 02:35:48.500
retrograde? Yes, so when you're looking at your chart, my chart


3141
02:35:48.500 --> 02:35:51.800
has all but two planets in retrograde the


3142
02:35:51.800 --> 02:35:54.200
Sun never goes retrograde. It's stagnant. It's


3143
02:35:54.200 --> 02:35:57.800
always going because it's geocentric but


3144
02:35:57.800 --> 02:36:01.900
the sun is the center for how we do this retrograde my


3145
02:36:01.900 --> 02:36:06.300
Venus and Mars are not but Saturn Pluto


3146
02:36:05.300 --> 02:36:10.600
Jupiter Uranus Neptune and


3147
02:36:10.600 --> 02:36:12.400
oh chiron's not


3148
02:36:13.100 --> 02:36:16.200
but most of the other ones are so even down here when


3149
02:36:16.200 --> 02:36:19.200
you start looking at the aspects and you look at the degrees you see the little


3150
02:36:19.200 --> 02:36:22.200
R's down here and d means direct because


3151
02:36:22.200 --> 02:36:22.700
the nodes


3152
02:36:23.500 --> 02:36:26.500
Actually retrograde for the nodes is normal. So


3153
02:36:26.500 --> 02:36:30.200
going Direct on a node is actually backwards, but


3154
02:36:29.200 --> 02:36:31.000
that's a whole other thing.


3155
02:36:32.400 --> 02:36:35.600
But that is retrograde and I'll be talking about retrogrades in


3156
02:36:35.600 --> 02:36:38.000
another class as well because that's a whole thing because I have to


3157
02:36:38.500 --> 02:36:42.400
talk a little bit more about each planet and how that plays out in a


3158
02:36:42.400 --> 02:36:44.500
retrograde and that retrogrades are not bad.


3159
02:36:45.400 --> 02:36:48.400
So if you end up having a retrograde or


3160
02:36:48.400 --> 02:36:52.700
seeing retrograde now even okay, so Mercury retrogrades


3161
02:36:52.700 --> 02:36:54.000
messing everything up like I said.


3162
02:36:55.300 --> 02:36:58.200
The purpose of Mercury retrograde is saying something's not right. It's not


3163
02:36:58.200 --> 02:37:01.500
going to work out the way you want. It needs to change and Capricorn. It


3164
02:37:01.500 --> 02:37:04.200
has to do with systems Authority structure something about


3165
02:37:04.200 --> 02:37:07.800
what I was doing wasn't going to work and that's why I went back and


3166
02:37:07.800 --> 02:37:09.100
I made all of


3167
02:37:10.300 --> 02:37:13.000
this real quick because I


3168
02:37:13.500 --> 02:37:16.500
realized I'm gonna need this my the


3169
02:37:16.500 --> 02:37:19.700
thing that's actually broadcasting everything for me that


3170
02:37:19.700 --> 02:37:22.000
system needed to be updated. Then Zoom needed to be


3171
02:37:22.300 --> 02:37:26.100
updated then something else. They need to be updated and my computer my entire


3172
02:37:25.100 --> 02:37:29.200
computer system. My Mac everything got updated


3173
02:37:28.200 --> 02:37:31.300
in the last two three hours like before


3174
02:37:31.300 --> 02:37:32.700
jumping on here.


3175
02:37:33.700 --> 02:37:36.500
That retrograde was to make sure that I


3176
02:37:36.500 --> 02:37:39.300
had a seamless program. If I didn't


3177
02:37:39.300 --> 02:37:42.700
listen to the Mercury great retrograde and I just tried to move forward. Everything


3178
02:37:42.700 --> 02:37:45.400
would have messed up. Everything would have been bad and I wouldn't


3179
02:37:45.400 --> 02:37:48.600
be able to have this this live but also it's setting


3180
02:37:48.600 --> 02:37:50.900
me up for the future and it's setting me up for


3181
02:37:51.800 --> 02:37:54.600
understanding that this class does need some visuals that


3182
02:37:54.600 --> 02:37:57.100
this class does have a certain time frame and that we're


3183
02:37:57.100 --> 02:38:00.200
going to figure out that based off of this because my next


3184
02:38:00.200 --> 02:38:03.400
class is outside of the Mercury retrograde. This one is


3185
02:38:03.400 --> 02:38:06.300
determining. Hey, we went over two hours, you know,


3186
02:38:06.300 --> 02:38:09.200
either you need to extend the time or you need to truncate a


3187
02:38:09.200 --> 02:38:10.000
little bit now. I know


3188
02:38:11.900 --> 02:38:14.700
The other classes Kathy are scheduled every


3189
02:38:14.700 --> 02:38:17.500
other Sunday. So two Sundays


3190
02:38:17.500 --> 02:38:20.400
from tonight is mine. So basically my wife is teaching


3191
02:38:20.400 --> 02:38:23.300
a psychic development class and then her second class


3192
02:38:23.300 --> 02:38:26.500
is tarot a course rather first class is


3193
02:38:26.500 --> 02:38:29.800
psychic development second one and third one are tarot. I don't


3194
02:38:29.800 --> 02:38:32.400
know the ones after that. I do know that she gets into herbalism and


3195
02:38:32.400 --> 02:38:35.600
wellness and meditation some other stuff. If you're


3196
02:38:35.600 --> 02:38:39.000
not taking her class, please sign up for that because it's amazing. She


3197
02:38:38.300 --> 02:38:42.000
taught me how to open up my third eye psychic


3198
02:38:41.400 --> 02:38:44.500
activation and I use my intuition when


3199
02:38:44.500 --> 02:38:47.100
I'm reading people's charts when I read my own


3200
02:38:47.100 --> 02:38:48.700
when I read others to be able to


3201
02:38:49.700 --> 02:38:52.700
Here are the messages from Spirit for what you need to hear part


3202
02:38:52.700 --> 02:38:56.600
of what makes me what I feel as a good astrology reader


3203
02:38:56.600 --> 02:38:58.400
is that I'm listening to my intuition.


3204
02:38:59.100 --> 02:39:02.100
When things don't line up the universe is


3205
02:39:02.100 --> 02:39:05.800
telling me the answer and I use that and I allow it Ashley taught


3206
02:39:05.800 --> 02:39:06.100
me that.


3207
02:39:06.800 --> 02:39:09.500
She opened up my third eye. She taught me how to do that. She


3208
02:39:09.500 --> 02:39:12.500
taught me tarot and now I read tarot, but I read tarot


3209
02:39:12.500 --> 02:39:15.200
My Own Way same thing with astrology. I'm teaching you guys


3210
02:39:15.200 --> 02:39:18.300
astrology. You're going to learn astrology through me


3211
02:39:18.300 --> 02:39:21.200
you're gonna learn my system and you're gonna take that and you're


3212
02:39:21.200 --> 02:39:24.300
gonna learn your own way. You're gonna develop your own way of reading


3213
02:39:24.300 --> 02:39:27.200
using your intuition if you're already locked in honed in


3214
02:39:27.200 --> 02:39:28.100
great otherwise,


3215
02:39:29.100 --> 02:39:32.100
It would behoove you to take Ashley's class now.


3216
02:39:34.700 --> 02:39:35.000
Yeah.


3217
02:39:36.700 --> 02:39:37.300
Let's see.


3218
02:39:41.100 --> 02:39:44.900
So my classes again if I didn't fully answer that my class tonight January


3219
02:39:44.900 --> 02:39:47.100
15th. My next class is in two weeks


3220
02:39:47.100 --> 02:39:50.300
on Sunday at 7pm. Same time. Each class is


3221
02:39:50.300 --> 02:39:53.800
going to be that way Ashley's is the Sunday between we


3222
02:39:53.800 --> 02:39:56.400
decided just to alternate Sundays to make it easier. There


3223
02:39:56.400 --> 02:39:59.800
are a lot of people already signed up for both classes. It just


3224
02:39:59.800 --> 02:40:02.300
makes it easier and you guys that you don't have to sit there


3225
02:40:02.300 --> 02:40:05.200
in the middle of the day and then the end of the day is just once a


3226
02:40:05.200 --> 02:40:08.000
week you guys will take it and it just


3227
02:40:08.300 --> 02:40:12.000
makes it easier. So my classes again every other week Sunday 7pm Eastern


3228
02:40:11.200 --> 02:40:12.500
Standard Time.


3229
02:40:14.300 --> 02:40:17.600
We did this Rick Mercury retrograde. What


3230
02:40:17.600 --> 02:40:20.300
if you don't have a placement in a house multiple placements in


3231
02:40:20.300 --> 02:40:20.600
one house?


3232
02:40:21.600 --> 02:40:24.500
Awesome, we're gonna get into stelliums and satellitiums in


3233
02:40:24.500 --> 02:40:27.900
either the next class of the one after that. But when


3234
02:40:27.900 --> 02:40:30.300
you have planets that I don't actually have


3235
02:40:30.300 --> 02:40:33.400
any stelliums, but when they're clustered together is considered


3236
02:40:33.400 --> 02:40:36.300
a stellium a stellium is of is a grouping of


3237
02:40:36.300 --> 02:40:39.700
three or more planets that are


3238
02:40:39.700 --> 02:40:42.500
within an orb of influence of


3239
02:40:42.500 --> 02:40:45.400
each other meaning they directly have conjunctions with each


3240
02:40:45.400 --> 02:40:48.400
other and aspect each other a satellitium, which


3241
02:40:48.400 --> 02:40:49.000
would be this.


3242
02:40:50.100 --> 02:40:53.300
Are three planets in the same house, but they're not


3243
02:40:53.300 --> 02:40:56.600
close enough to be impacting each other. So they all


3244
02:40:56.600 --> 02:40:59.100
operate in the same house. They all affect the house,


3245
02:40:59.100 --> 02:41:02.200
but they don't affect each other. So my Mars has


3246
02:41:02.200 --> 02:41:05.300
nothing to do with my Pluto unless it's aspected in


3247
02:41:05.300 --> 02:41:08.200
a different sense, which it's not and same thing


3248
02:41:08.200 --> 02:41:09.300
with my my Saturn.


3249
02:41:14.200 --> 02:41:17.600
Oh an empty house means that your energies are


3250
02:41:17.600 --> 02:41:20.200
not concentrated in that area of life. It doesn't mean


3251
02:41:20.200 --> 02:41:23.300
that it doesn't matter. It doesn't mean that nothing happens. It just means


3252
02:41:23.300 --> 02:41:26.400
that you need to pay attention to the Chart rule or the house


3253
02:41:26.400 --> 02:41:30.100
ruler. So in this case my ninth house Mars everything


3254
02:41:29.100 --> 02:41:32.800
that affects my ninth house my education my


3255
02:41:32.800 --> 02:41:34.100
college my


3256
02:41:36.500 --> 02:41:39.700
My philosophies my travel that's all


3257
02:41:39.700 --> 02:41:42.400
sitting down here in my third house. I


3258
02:41:42.400 --> 02:41:43.100
didn't go to college.


3259
02:41:43.900 --> 02:41:46.200
Not because it's an empty house, but because


3260
02:41:46.200 --> 02:41:50.700
I went to school I barely graduated


3261
02:41:50.700 --> 02:41:53.200
because in the 11th grade I decided I didn't want


3262
02:41:53.200 --> 02:41:56.500
to go to college. I said 12th grades a waste of my life. So I


3263
02:41:56.500 --> 02:41:59.300
dropped all my courses to standard and I was always in advanced placement


3264
02:41:59.300 --> 02:42:02.500
and I almost didn't feel I did


3265
02:42:02.500 --> 02:42:04.200
but then I my father.


3266
02:42:05.100 --> 02:42:08.400
Had a one-on-one my mother and my father but my they


3267
02:42:08.400 --> 02:42:11.100
had a one-on-one said I need to go there and then if


3268
02:42:11.100 --> 02:42:14.600
I don't like it, then I don't have to and I said, nope. I


3269
02:42:14.600 --> 02:42:15.200
don't want to do it.


3270
02:42:16.500 --> 02:42:19.500
That has to do with this. This is why I didn't go to college but I have


3271
02:42:19.500 --> 02:42:23.000
my higher education here through research and


3272
02:42:22.300 --> 02:42:25.200
through deep knowledge and I studied the things


3273
02:42:25.200 --> 02:42:28.700
I care about and that's kind of What's led me along my


3274
02:42:28.700 --> 02:42:31.300
life as I I get I am Mass a


3275
02:42:31.300 --> 02:42:33.900
lot of information here with all of this but


3276
02:42:35.300 --> 02:42:38.200
I never had any desire to go to a university or anything


3277
02:42:38.200 --> 02:42:41.400
like that. So it just means that you need to look to the Chart rollers see


3278
02:42:41.400 --> 02:42:43.000
how that house is actually impacted.


3279
02:42:44.200 --> 02:42:47.600
Which house or houses would you say have an influence over marketing?


3280
02:42:47.600 --> 02:42:50.500
Well, if you're talking about the media aspect of marketing one


3281
02:42:50.500 --> 02:42:53.900
thing I forgot to say about Pisces is it rules media, which


3282
02:42:53.900 --> 02:42:57.000
is again intangible creativity. It's when


3283
02:42:56.200 --> 02:42:59.700
you go on social media that actual picture that's


3284
02:42:59.700 --> 02:43:01.100
sitting there is Pisces ruled.


3285
02:43:02.100 --> 02:43:05.800
So the 12th house Neptune Pisces has


3286
02:43:05.800 --> 02:43:08.700
to do with marketing Sagittarius does


3287
02:43:08.700 --> 02:43:11.400
because Sagittarius also rule ninth house


3288
02:43:11.400 --> 02:43:13.700
Sagittarius also rules.


3289
02:43:16.200 --> 02:43:19.700
Here we go. Sagittarius also rules publishing and


3290
02:43:19.700 --> 02:43:22.500
an advertising and then


3291
02:43:22.500 --> 02:43:26.500
the third house is sales and Logistics


3292
02:43:25.500 --> 02:43:28.400
and then marketing also


3293
02:43:28.400 --> 02:43:31.600
is Libra it all depends on what aspect this is why is


3294
02:43:31.600 --> 02:43:34.500
very important to get very specific when you're asking somebody what


3295
02:43:34.500 --> 02:43:37.200
do you want to do? What are you doing now? Because if someone just


3296
02:43:37.200 --> 02:43:41.100
says marketing it's like, all right. Are you


3297
02:43:41.100 --> 02:43:44.300
doing it for Public Image and reputation? Like are you the boss of a marketing


3298
02:43:44.300 --> 02:43:47.500
company? You have your own marketing company. Do you work one-on-one. Do


3299
02:43:47.500 --> 02:43:50.200
you do the design? Are you doing the sales of marketing? Are


3300
02:43:50.200 --> 02:43:53.200
you the one who publishes? Are you the one who creates? Are you using


3301
02:43:53.200 --> 02:43:56.300
social media for marketing every Mouse movement that


3302
02:43:56.300 --> 02:43:59.200
I just made is all marketing, but it


3303
02:43:59.200 --> 02:44:03.000
depends on what aspect of marketing. It's like I work


3304
02:44:02.200 --> 02:44:05.200
in real estate. It's like well what aspect do you


3305
02:44:05.200 --> 02:44:08.800
make the houses? Do you sell the houses? Do you design


3306
02:44:08.800 --> 02:44:11.400
the houses? Do you like work with


3307
02:44:11.400 --> 02:44:14.400
like government and Contracting and


3308
02:44:14.400 --> 02:44:15.600
whatnot like which


3309
02:44:15.900 --> 02:44:18.800
Try to be here as well. Like what is it that you


3310
02:44:18.800 --> 02:44:21.300
do Contracting arguably would be sixth and


3311
02:44:21.300 --> 02:44:21.700
seventh house.


3312
02:44:22.800 --> 02:44:25.100
So it's it gets very detailed because you have


3313
02:44:25.100 --> 02:44:28.400
to this is why understanding the energies is


3314
02:44:28.400 --> 02:44:31.700
extremely important when we go through these and you kind of look at you


3315
02:44:31.700 --> 02:44:32.400
know what we've put here.


3316
02:44:33.300 --> 02:44:36.100
It's like when we're talking about your business.


3317
02:44:37.400 --> 02:44:37.900
where to go


3318
02:44:38.400 --> 02:44:39.700
we're talking about your no.


3319
02:44:41.800 --> 02:44:44.800
Sorry your business here. This is the actual business


3320
02:44:44.800 --> 02:44:47.500
itself and your relationship with the business


3321
02:44:47.500 --> 02:44:48.700
or business partners.


3322
02:44:49.600 --> 02:44:50.500
if your business


3323
02:44:52.300 --> 02:44:55.200
is in Fitness, this is the business. This is


3324
02:44:55.200 --> 02:44:58.300
the legal structure. This is your date not you're


3325
02:44:58.300 --> 02:45:01.700
not even your day-to-day operations. That's Virgo how you


3326
02:45:01.700 --> 02:45:04.600
engage with other people would


3327
02:45:04.600 --> 02:45:08.400
be this how you engage with the public but Capricorn


3328
02:45:07.400 --> 02:45:09.700
would be your Public Image.


3329
02:45:10.900 --> 02:45:13.800
Capricorn would be the reputation of your business. So


3330
02:45:13.800 --> 02:45:16.800
like I said, it's it's understanding that everything


3331
02:45:16.800 --> 02:45:19.500
is broken down. And when you're looking at charting


3332
02:45:19.500 --> 02:45:22.400
your reading you have to pause for a moment, you have to say what am


3333
02:45:22.400 --> 02:45:25.700
I really talking about? What is the energy behind the theme


3334
02:45:25.700 --> 02:45:28.400
of what I really mean when I talk about my physical


3335
02:45:28.400 --> 02:45:28.800
body?


3336
02:45:29.800 --> 02:45:32.800
just as it is when I get into medical astrology


3337
02:45:32.800 --> 02:45:35.300
and I understand that Pluto is


3338
02:45:35.300 --> 02:45:38.400
the both the reproductive and the


3339
02:45:38.400 --> 02:45:39.400
X like


3340
02:45:40.500 --> 02:45:45.100
Pee and poop the elimination Capricorn


3341
02:45:43.100 --> 02:45:46.800
is all about the structure the


3342
02:45:46.800 --> 02:45:49.500
spine the bones and the joints Pisces is


3343
02:45:49.500 --> 02:45:53.000
the feet Uranus is the ankles Sagittarius is


3344
02:45:52.100 --> 02:45:55.000
the hips and thighs where Sagittarius right here


3345
02:45:55.100 --> 02:45:58.500
understanding that each one has its own placement. And


3346
02:45:58.500 --> 02:46:02.000
then when you're talking about, you know, that's why the chart


3347
02:46:01.500 --> 02:46:04.200
ruler the first house the ascendant all of


3348
02:46:04.200 --> 02:46:07.200
this is your physical body because it links in with


3349
02:46:07.200 --> 02:46:10.300
medical astrology. It links in with the actual physical you do


3350
02:46:10.300 --> 02:46:14.000
not look like your siblings. I mean you do but you


3351
02:46:13.100 --> 02:46:16.200
don't look like you're siblings. Look at your hair lines. Look


3352
02:46:16.200 --> 02:46:19.200
at who's got thicker versus thinner hair. Look at your height. Look


3353
02:46:19.200 --> 02:46:21.700
at your weight. Look at the things you deal with you're not your siblings.


3354
02:46:22.800 --> 02:46:26.000
In this lifetime you share common family


3355
02:46:25.400 --> 02:46:28.800
and that comes through all your your moon


3356
02:46:28.800 --> 02:46:32.600
stuff. It comes through your lineage, but it


3357
02:46:32.600 --> 02:46:35.300
doesn't come through and the IC is


3358
02:46:35.300 --> 02:46:38.200
part of it of what you look like and


3359
02:46:38.200 --> 02:46:39.200
where you came from, but


3360
02:46:40.100 --> 02:46:43.200
You know your first house is actually your physical traits in your body.


3361
02:46:44.300 --> 02:46:47.900
Is it true that you should not start a business during a Mercury retrograde? It


3362
02:46:47.900 --> 02:46:50.600
depends on what you're doing. If you're if


3363
02:46:50.600 --> 02:46:53.200
you are doing sales outward sales.


3364
02:46:54.800 --> 02:46:57.600
And you need to get a product outward. I probably


3365
02:46:57.600 --> 02:47:00.300
wouldn't start it during a Mercury retrograde if you


3366
02:47:00.300 --> 02:47:03.400
were doing sales where the sales have to come into you


3367
02:47:03.400 --> 02:47:04.000
and you have to


3368
02:47:05.300 --> 02:47:08.300
Like find a way to sell somebody who doesn't want


3369
02:47:08.300 --> 02:47:09.000
to be sold to.


3370
02:47:09.800 --> 02:47:12.200
Mercury retrograde is great because that


3371
02:47:12.200 --> 02:47:15.700
Mercury retrograde is Inward and again, I'll get to retrogrades in another


3372
02:47:15.700 --> 02:47:16.300
class, but


3373
02:47:17.100 --> 02:47:20.400
You're taking energy of that planet. You're turning it, Inward and you're


3374
02:47:20.400 --> 02:47:21.000
thinking differently.


3375
02:47:21.900 --> 02:47:24.800
Because it's Mercury instead of thinking linearly and


3376
02:47:24.800 --> 02:47:27.800
straightforward you're thinking abstractly and


3377
02:47:27.800 --> 02:47:30.700
you're coming back in on yourself and you're thinking like this which


3378
02:47:30.700 --> 02:47:33.000
is patterns. They create when you think


3379
02:47:33.200 --> 02:47:36.100
like this, it becomes patterns, it's abstract. So people who


3380
02:47:36.100 --> 02:47:39.900
are born like myself with a Mercury retrograde tend to


3381
02:47:39.900 --> 02:47:42.200
think not linearly. They think over here they


3382
02:47:42.200 --> 02:47:45.000
come over here they come here and then they get their answer and they tend to


3383
02:47:45.100 --> 02:47:48.600
think in patterns patterns are much easier. They're more visual Learners.


3384
02:47:48.600 --> 02:47:51.700
It's almost a Pisces type Vibe like a Mercury and


3385
02:47:51.700 --> 02:47:54.700
Pisces where they a bit more visual a


3386
02:47:54.700 --> 02:47:57.400
bit more like it's not quite Pisces because


3387
02:47:57.400 --> 02:48:00.400
that is like more abstract. That is more. Like I need to see


3388
02:48:00.400 --> 02:48:03.500
it visualize it but it is very


3389
02:48:03.500 --> 02:48:06.500
abstract in the sense that you're doing patterns


3390
02:48:06.500 --> 02:48:08.900
and you get there in a way that other people don't understand.


3391
02:48:10.300 --> 02:48:12.100
Unless they have a Mercury retrograde as well.


3392
02:48:13.500 --> 02:48:16.600
What happens if your chart is bottom heavy? I'll talk


3393
02:48:16.600 --> 02:48:20.100
about this again. Well, I could just talk about it now the


3394
02:48:22.400 --> 02:48:23.800
government card


3395
02:48:24.400 --> 02:48:24.700
mmm


3396
02:48:27.200 --> 02:48:30.900
angles the angles here which technically are these so


3397
02:48:30.900 --> 02:48:33.200
they go this way and then for mine, they


3398
02:48:33.200 --> 02:48:36.300
go this way everything that sits this side is


3399
02:48:36.300 --> 02:48:40.500
the Eastern Hemisphere. This is the Western Hemisphere you're


3400
02:48:39.500 --> 02:48:43.100
ascendant is the constellation that


3401
02:48:42.100 --> 02:48:45.100
was coming up over the Eastern Horizon when


3402
02:48:45.100 --> 02:48:45.500
you were born


3403
02:48:46.400 --> 02:48:49.700
The top is the northern the bottom is the Southern Hemisphere


3404
02:48:49.700 --> 02:48:52.400
bottom means you're more private top means


3405
02:48:52.400 --> 02:48:55.700
you're more outgoing left or Eastern means


3406
02:48:55.700 --> 02:48:58.400
you are more of a self-starter right or Western


3407
02:48:58.400 --> 02:49:01.500
means you need other people to help get


3408
02:49:01.500 --> 02:49:04.400
you going and motivate you or whatever you do day to


3409
02:49:04.400 --> 02:49:07.600
day you prefer with others or need others to be able to to


3410
02:49:07.600 --> 02:49:07.900
live life.


3411
02:49:09.900 --> 02:49:12.200
So bottom heavy just means you're more introverted.


3412
02:49:14.800 --> 02:49:17.800
I know her schedule and I am registered seems Sundays


3413
02:49:17.800 --> 02:49:20.800
will be a thing. Oh, yes. Yes Kathy Sundays


3414
02:49:20.800 --> 02:49:21.600
are the thing.


3415
02:49:22.300 --> 02:49:25.400
Sunday at Ashley's classes every Sunday at 3


3416
02:49:25.400 --> 02:49:28.100
pm Eastern Standard Time because she puts the baby down. So she


3417
02:49:28.100 --> 02:49:31.300
does her earlier. Mine is at 7pm because she puts the


3418
02:49:31.300 --> 02:49:35.000
baby down and it's this is what I can do while that's


3419
02:49:34.000 --> 02:49:35.200
happening.


3420
02:49:35.900 --> 02:49:38.700
Angie is it normal to feel overwhelmed


3421
02:49:38.700 --> 02:49:41.700
at first of this? Hell, yeah. I am cramming


3422
02:49:41.700 --> 02:49:44.600
seven years of learning into to


3423
02:49:44.600 --> 02:49:47.600
seven classes seven two-hour sessions 14


3424
02:49:47.600 --> 02:49:50.100
hours and not everything but I'm


3425
02:49:50.100 --> 02:49:53.200
cramming a lot and the reason why you have access to rewatch. This


3426
02:49:53.200 --> 02:49:56.500
is not you're not supposed to grasp everything everybody who


3427
02:49:56.500 --> 02:49:59.600
sitting here like, oh my God. Oh my God. Don't don't do that


3428
02:49:59.600 --> 02:50:02.200
to yourself. You have to also remember when I


3429
02:50:02.200 --> 02:50:02.700
was talking about


3430
02:50:03.700 --> 02:50:06.500
Gemini and the third house down here and


3431
02:50:06.500 --> 02:50:09.200
I was telling you that this is early learning. This is how you learn


3432
02:50:09.200 --> 02:50:12.300
and wherever Gemini is whatever the third house


3433
02:50:12.300 --> 02:50:15.800
is planets here. Wherever Mercury is brings elements


3434
02:50:15.800 --> 02:50:18.500
here. If you have let's say Saturn or


3435
02:50:18.500 --> 02:50:21.300
a Capricorn here or


3436
02:50:21.300 --> 02:50:24.700
a Mercury in the tenth house or a Mercury and Capricorn you


3437
02:50:24.700 --> 02:50:28.200
are not going to grasp this unless you have like uranium uranium


3438
02:50:27.200 --> 02:50:30.100
energy attached to it. You're not gonna grasp this


3439
02:50:30.100 --> 02:50:33.900
on the first go everyone learns differently and when


3440
02:50:33.900 --> 02:50:36.800
I do parent and and child charts, this


3441
02:50:36.800 --> 02:50:39.300
is one of the things I focus on is, how


3442
02:50:39.300 --> 02:50:42.200
does your child learn because you don't


3443
02:50:42.200 --> 02:50:45.300
want them to struggle in school? No parent wants to see their kids struggle.


3444
02:50:46.700 --> 02:50:49.400
Understanding how they will learn is extremely important understanding how


3445
02:50:49.400 --> 02:50:52.300
you will learn is extremely important. For instance.


3446
02:50:52.300 --> 02:50:55.300
I in my chart I dive deep


3447
02:50:55.300 --> 02:50:58.300
I learn better when I'm working with somebody when I'm talking it out.


3448
02:50:58.300 --> 02:51:01.300
I dive in I just I just


3449
02:51:01.300 --> 02:51:04.400
want to keep shooting off ideas. I want to get it and want that banter. I


3450
02:51:04.400 --> 02:51:07.200
wanted to go back and forth. It's tied in with groups. I


3451
02:51:07.200 --> 02:51:10.400
love talking in groups about things just hopes and


3452
02:51:10.400 --> 02:51:13.200
dreams and the what ifs with with Jupiter spilling in here,


3453
02:51:13.200 --> 02:51:17.100
but I don't get everything. I don't grasp everything especially systems


3454
02:51:16.100 --> 02:51:17.700
because it's


3455
02:51:18.800 --> 02:51:22.200
Especially Financial systems. I talk a lot about like investing


3456
02:51:21.200 --> 02:51:24.300
in amassing worth wealth. I don't do that.


3457
02:51:24.300 --> 02:51:27.200
I do not understand the stock market at all.


3458
02:51:27.200 --> 02:51:30.600
I don't get it for whatever reason this energy here and


3459
02:51:30.600 --> 02:51:32.700
in conjunct Venus, I don't get it. I use it.


3460
02:51:33.400 --> 02:51:36.200
But I don't make the play. I know my energy. I know


3461
02:51:36.200 --> 02:51:39.300
that I don't understand. I know I can use it. I just know that I won't understand


3462
02:51:39.300 --> 02:51:42.200
it. So this is me saying I need it for my career. I need


3463
02:51:42.200 --> 02:51:45.200
certain systems for my career and I need to use those things


3464
02:51:45.200 --> 02:51:48.200
and Investments, but I don't understand it because I just have a hard time


3465
02:51:48.200 --> 02:51:51.500
learning it and even here I would have to really really study


3466
02:51:51.500 --> 02:51:54.200
to grasp it and I'm just not interested. I don't


3467
02:51:54.200 --> 02:51:57.200
care I have other things that I enjoy doing but this is what


3468
02:51:57.200 --> 02:52:00.200
it has to do and and a lot of things once I get into


3469
02:52:00.200 --> 02:52:04.100
it and it's something that I like and I think it's usable and useful that's


3470
02:52:03.100 --> 02:52:05.200
Saturn energy useful.


3471
02:52:06.600 --> 02:52:09.500
Hell out of it I get so obsessed and


3472
02:52:09.500 --> 02:52:12.400
it becomes my world and that's how I got into astrology and


3473
02:52:12.400 --> 02:52:15.700
that's why I know what I know in astrology. But I also trial


3474
02:52:15.700 --> 02:52:18.700
and error when it doesn't work I go again. If it this is


3475
02:52:18.700 --> 02:52:21.500
also the element of how do I Implement things


3476
02:52:21.500 --> 02:52:24.100
because it's Mars. It's in the third house. I try it.


3477
02:52:24.100 --> 02:52:27.200
I actually mentally communicate and I do it with other


3478
02:52:27.200 --> 02:52:30.400
people. Does it work? Does it work that is it true? Is


3479
02:52:30.400 --> 02:52:33.200
it honest meaning is it in the third house


3480
02:52:33.200 --> 02:52:36.500
is a factual but Saturn's Integrity as well


3481
02:52:36.500 --> 02:52:39.800
is it it's on top of Venus. Does


3482
02:52:39.800 --> 02:52:42.200
it work? No, it doesn't work back to the drawing board.


3483
02:52:42.200 --> 02:52:45.100
Does it work back to the drawing board? And this is how the cycle works. I


3484
02:52:45.100 --> 02:52:48.600
literally say, nope. Go back. Does it work? Nope go back and this


3485
02:52:48.600 --> 02:52:51.700
is the cycle Perpetual. I sometimes that's


3486
02:52:51.700 --> 02:52:52.900
annoying because I'll buy something.


3487
02:52:54.500 --> 02:52:58.000
Um that I want you know, and I'll


3488
02:52:57.100 --> 02:53:00.100
try it. I don't like it and I return it


3489
02:53:00.100 --> 02:53:03.600
which is this energy here and I do it a lot. I do


3490
02:53:03.600 --> 02:53:04.000
it all the time.


3491
02:53:05.300 --> 02:53:08.300
So that's kind of that. I want to use this modality so


3492
02:53:08.300 --> 02:53:11.700
much in my life, but my brain is like, oh don't don't feel that


3493
02:53:11.700 --> 02:53:14.600
way Angie. It's it's completely normal.


3494
02:53:15.700 --> 02:53:18.300
For you to feel overwhelmed with something


3495
02:53:18.300 --> 02:53:21.400
that is so mathematically intense, which I'm hoping


3496
02:53:21.400 --> 02:53:24.200
in this class that I really took the edge off of


3497
02:53:24.200 --> 02:53:27.100
the math. Even when I get into the degrees and everything and I've took the


3498
02:53:27.100 --> 02:53:29.800
edge off of the seriousness and the


3499
02:53:31.400 --> 02:53:34.200
I don't know the boringness. I hope this was exciting. I hope this


3500
02:53:34.200 --> 02:53:37.400
like was absorbable even if it not


3501
02:53:37.400 --> 02:53:40.200
everything because I talk fast I info dump


3502
02:53:40.200 --> 02:53:43.200
a lot. I don't expect everybody to get it. I


3503
02:53:43.200 --> 02:53:46.400
have to slow down if I wanted to but I'm I'm cramming as


3504
02:53:46.400 --> 02:53:49.400
much as I can. I want you to get your value out of this. So I


3505
02:53:49.400 --> 02:53:50.600
hope that that came across.


3506
02:53:52.100 --> 02:53:55.400
This was great. All right, I appreciate that guys. I


3507
02:53:55.400 --> 02:53:58.100
appreciate that Brandy as well. You've done a great job. Thank you


3508
02:53:58.100 --> 02:54:01.800
that really helps because I was concerned not


3509
02:54:01.800 --> 02:54:05.500
because I don't think I'm a good teacher but because every every


3510
02:54:04.500 --> 02:54:07.400
school every class even the


3511
02:54:07.400 --> 02:54:10.400
ones that Ashley's watching they have nothing to do with astrology. I'm just


3512
02:54:10.400 --> 02:54:13.300
like, oh my God are all classes like this


3513
02:54:13.300 --> 02:54:16.200
and obviously there has to be an interest for


3514
02:54:16.200 --> 02:54:16.800
it but like


3515
02:54:18.100 --> 02:54:21.300
Oh man, some of them are super boring some of the ones on YouTube some that


3516
02:54:21.300 --> 02:54:24.300
I checked out before I did it trying to figure out how I wanted to do it. I


3517
02:54:24.300 --> 02:54:28.200
actually just went with this setup because I do readings like this you see


3518
02:54:27.200 --> 02:54:30.700
me. You see what I'm pointing to I zoom


3519
02:54:30.700 --> 02:54:33.100
in if I need to let's talk about it. Let's zoom out


3520
02:54:33.100 --> 02:54:36.400
and then for this class I made extra materials so


3521
02:54:36.400 --> 02:54:40.200
that I could you know, get that up there. So Lori Ann,


3522
02:54:40.200 --> 02:54:41.500
when can we sign up for class two?


3523
02:54:42.500 --> 02:54:45.100
You know, it should be up shouldn't it in the next?


3524
02:54:46.500 --> 02:54:49.300
it's gonna take me two to three days, but I will get it up it is


3525
02:54:49.300 --> 02:54:49.600
going to be


3526
02:54:50.800 --> 02:54:53.400
Two weeks from now. Where's my phone? I put it somewhere


3527
02:54:53.400 --> 02:54:54.300
where it wouldn't bother me.


3528
02:54:55.800 --> 02:54:56.900
It is going to be.


3529
02:54:59.300 --> 02:55:00.200
The 29th.


3530
02:55:00.800 --> 02:55:04.400
It'll be January 29th at 7pm Eastern


3531
02:55:03.400 --> 02:55:06.500
Standard Time. Same deal except


3532
02:55:06.500 --> 02:55:09.200
we'll be taught and I'll put a video out you'll know exactly what


3533
02:55:09.200 --> 02:55:12.600
we're gonna learn. I'm going to I didn't want to I


3534
02:55:12.600 --> 02:55:15.300
kept saying I was gonna tell you what everything was but all


3535
02:55:15.300 --> 02:55:18.500
these videos but I was like Mercury retrograde something's got


3536
02:55:18.500 --> 02:55:21.200
to change. So I held out on releasing the


3537
02:55:21.200 --> 02:55:24.100
second class because I didn't want to put out and say hey this is what we're


3538
02:55:24.100 --> 02:55:27.800
doing ahead of time knowing the Mercury retrograde in Capricorn


3539
02:55:27.800 --> 02:55:29.500
was gonna make me Teach Authority.


3540
02:55:30.400 --> 02:55:33.300
And my Jupiter here and we're Jupiter is over


3541
02:55:33.300 --> 02:55:36.800
in Aries. I'm just gonna have to teach differently. I


3542
02:55:36.800 --> 02:55:39.200
was gonna I knew I was gonna run out of time. So that was


3543
02:55:39.200 --> 02:55:41.200
important, but that will be up in the next few days.


3544
02:55:42.200 --> 02:55:42.400
and


3545
02:55:44.400 --> 02:55:47.000
Yeah, hope you guys enjoyed the first class and want to go to the


3546
02:55:47.300 --> 02:55:51.300
second class. Is there a chart to use to evaluate evaluate


3547
02:55:50.300 --> 02:55:53.400
your own business? Yes, spoke a


3548
02:55:53.400 --> 02:55:57.000
little bit about it earlier. It is called an election chart it


3549
02:55:56.700 --> 02:55:59.500
you cast it pretty much like this except. It's


3550
02:55:59.500 --> 02:56:02.700
an event chart and it has to do with how


3551
02:56:02.700 --> 02:56:06.100
the business is finances are what the businesses reputation if


3552
02:56:05.100 --> 02:56:08.300
there are any business partners how the money will be


3553
02:56:08.300 --> 02:56:11.400
that's all in the things that are hidden that you should you should


3554
02:56:11.400 --> 02:56:14.800
be aware of the seventh house is also open enemies


3555
02:56:14.800 --> 02:56:17.500
the 12th house is hidden enemies hidden open.


3556
02:56:18.400 --> 02:56:21.100
Understanding when people like to challenge you how they


3557
02:56:21.100 --> 02:56:24.200
show up in your chart my hidden enemies become my open


3558
02:56:24.200 --> 02:56:28.500
enemies. They just reveal themselves, which actually is great for me


3559
02:56:28.500 --> 02:56:31.000
because they always you know, I don't have


3560
02:56:31.100 --> 02:56:31.900
to wonder.


3561
02:56:34.500 --> 02:56:37.200
But then again, sometimes it's like people who are really close to


3562
02:56:37.200 --> 02:56:40.600
me end up being that's been a theme of my life that my hidden


3563
02:56:40.600 --> 02:56:43.500
enemies actually don't reveal themselves until much


3564
02:56:43.500 --> 02:56:45.700
later and that has kind of sucked in my life.


3565
02:56:46.400 --> 02:56:50.200
Especially when I was in Film Production, but that


3566
02:56:49.200 --> 02:56:52.100
is an election chart that won't be


3567
02:56:52.100 --> 02:56:55.100
in this course, but I will do a class or course on that


3568
02:56:55.100 --> 02:56:58.300
and then you can run sinistry, which is also going


3569
02:56:58.300 --> 02:56:58.900
to be another course.


3570
02:57:01.500 --> 02:57:03.500
Does sixth house have anything to do with pets?


3571
02:57:05.900 --> 02:57:08.800
Hmm. Yes, and it supposed


3572
02:57:08.800 --> 02:57:10.400
to it's supposed to


3573
02:57:12.500 --> 02:57:15.500
astrology is all about perspective and I've noticed


3574
02:57:17.300 --> 02:57:20.400
I've noticed in my own charts and I don't like to talk about pets


3575
02:57:20.400 --> 02:57:23.400
too much for this reason. It's supposed


3576
02:57:23.400 --> 02:57:26.500
to be ruled by the sixth house supposed to be small animals in


3577
02:57:26.500 --> 02:57:29.900
pets. I've noticed that usually when


3578
02:57:29.900 --> 02:57:32.400
stuff happens. Sometimes it's in the sixth house


3579
02:57:32.400 --> 02:57:35.600
and sometimes in the fifth house because a lot of us treat our


3580
02:57:35.600 --> 02:57:36.400
pets like children.


3581
02:57:37.500 --> 02:57:40.000
And astrology is not black and white. It is about


3582
02:57:40.600 --> 02:57:44.100
perspective and it is about perception. So I don't the reason


3583
02:57:43.100 --> 02:57:46.500
why pets wasn't listed in small animals wasn't listed


3584
02:57:46.500 --> 02:57:49.400
here is because I've seen it not be there.


3585
02:57:49.400 --> 02:57:52.300
So there are a few things that you may look at my chart


3586
02:57:52.300 --> 02:57:55.300
and be like, well, what about this? This is usually in this house and I don't


3587
02:57:55.300 --> 02:57:58.300
put it there because I don't see it in that house. I see it in other


3588
02:57:58.300 --> 02:57:59.500
houses or I see it split


3589
02:58:01.900 --> 02:58:04.500
Melissa, I thought I was introverted but


3590
02:58:04.500 --> 02:58:07.300
maybe not my chart is top habit. Well if your top


3591
02:58:07.900 --> 02:58:10.700
If it's top here that's like very rudimentary if


3592
02:58:10.700 --> 02:58:11.800
all the rulers.


3593
02:58:14.600 --> 02:58:17.200
Well, you're taking all your private stuff. You're putting it


3594
02:58:17.200 --> 02:58:18.800
out, but also realize that top heavy.


3595
02:58:19.900 --> 02:58:22.500
That's what it's supposed to be. But look The


3596
02:58:22.500 --> 02:58:24.400
Eighth House in the 12th house are both in the top.


3597
02:58:25.100 --> 02:58:28.700
And those are both hidden so don't take the top versus bottom


3598
02:58:28.700 --> 02:58:31.400
the East and West is absolutely true the top and


3599
02:58:31.400 --> 02:58:34.400
bottom. I don't know about that which is why I was I


3600
02:58:34.400 --> 02:58:36.400
almost didn't answer that question that way.


3601
02:58:37.300 --> 02:58:40.100
But it also depends on where the rulers are and I think that's one of


3602
02:58:40.100 --> 02:58:40.900
the major problems.


3603
02:58:43.700 --> 02:58:46.300
Is that you know this house and this house, although this


3604
02:58:46.300 --> 02:58:49.600
is shared resources. And this is not you. This is


3605
02:58:49.600 --> 02:58:53.600
your connection to the collective when


3606
02:58:52.600 --> 02:58:55.100
things sit here they can make


3607
02:58:55.100 --> 02:58:58.700
you very introverted. So and if any of these are Pluto it


3608
02:58:58.700 --> 02:59:01.100
can do the same thing. So take it with a grain of salt for


3609
02:59:01.100 --> 02:59:01.100
that.


3610
02:59:02.100 --> 02:59:05.700
But that's the general answer is that this is introvert and


3611
02:59:05.700 --> 02:59:08.000
this is extroverted or this is more private. And this is


3612
02:59:08.300 --> 02:59:11.200
more outgoing like more more public. It's not


3613
02:59:11.200 --> 02:59:13.800
necessarily that you're an extrovert. It's more that people. See you.


3614
02:59:14.600 --> 02:59:17.800
And you're what you do is not as private. It's


3615
02:59:17.800 --> 02:59:19.300
out for people to see.


3616
02:59:21.100 --> 02:59:24.300
My Geminis in the 12th house with Chiron would that mean I have difficulty


3617
02:59:24.300 --> 02:59:28.600
expressing my mind definitely means that you have and I


3618
02:59:28.600 --> 02:59:32.000
won't I'm gonna get into Chiron in a different class. But when


3619
02:59:31.400 --> 02:59:34.700
Chiron sits here, it has to do with spiritual issues as to


3620
02:59:34.700 --> 02:59:37.400
deal with not dealing with your wounds and maybe not even


3621
02:59:37.400 --> 02:59:39.000
being aware of what your wounds are.


3622
02:59:39.700 --> 02:59:42.500
In Gemini, it has to do with communication siblings.


3623
02:59:45.600 --> 02:59:48.500
There's the main two things and just not believing that you're smart


3624
02:59:48.500 --> 02:59:48.700
enough.


3625
02:59:49.600 --> 02:59:52.500
Actually, if you're taking this course with a Chiron in the 12th house


3626
02:59:52.500 --> 02:59:55.400
in Gemini, you could feel like you're not smart enough


3627
02:59:55.400 --> 02:59:58.700
to grasp everything. I'm saying just realize that Cairo


3628
02:59:58.700 --> 03:00:00.100
comes early in life.


3629
03:00:00.900 --> 03:00:03.400
Has nothing to do with you and it is something that


3630
03:00:03.400 --> 03:00:06.000
you can heal from but it's always going to be there reminding you.


3631
03:00:06.900 --> 03:00:09.100
Kathy have a great night. Thank you


3632
03:00:09.100 --> 03:00:10.100
for being here.


3633
03:00:11.100 --> 03:00:14.300
Patrick is there a website or somewhere we can go to follow the


3634
03:00:14.300 --> 03:00:18.600
Cycles phases and arrows that we're in right now. Honestly astro.com


3635
03:00:17.600 --> 03:00:19.400
has the best


3636
03:00:22.800 --> 03:00:24.900
descriptions


3637
03:00:29.900 --> 03:00:30.500
Where is it?


3638
03:00:31.900 --> 03:00:33.800
Let me see if I can pull it up while you guys are here.


3639
03:00:38.200 --> 03:00:41.500
And stroh.com if I


3640
03:00:41.500 --> 03:00:42.900
can spell it would really help.


3641
03:00:45.200 --> 03:00:46.100
Okay, so


3642
03:00:47.300 --> 03:00:50.900
There's this whole article here by Robert Fitzgerald


3643
03:00:50.900 --> 03:00:53.800
who is a pretty well known


3644
03:00:53.800 --> 03:00:56.400
astrologer and most of what he


3645
03:00:56.400 --> 03:00:59.400
says not everything. Do I agree with in this in this


3646
03:00:59.400 --> 03:00:59.700
article?


3647
03:01:01.900 --> 03:01:04.100
One thing I forgot to mention with cancer now that


3648
03:01:04.100 --> 03:01:07.500
I'm thinking about it when from reading this article is cancer does rule


3649
03:01:07.500 --> 03:01:10.800
agriculture. It does not rule food. It does.


3650
03:01:11.900 --> 03:01:15.500
Involve farming in agriculture, but this


3651
03:01:15.500 --> 03:01:18.200
whole thing talks about the age of cancer age of


3652
03:01:18.200 --> 03:01:19.900
Gemini and then it breaks it down.


3653
03:01:23.400 --> 03:01:26.900
To the phases Aquarius era


3654
03:01:26.900 --> 03:01:30.600
phase of Scorpio keeps going Gemini


3655
03:01:29.600 --> 03:01:30.900
face.


3656
03:01:31.800 --> 03:01:34.500
And it doesn't get into cancer and this was


3657
03:01:34.500 --> 03:01:35.200
actually written.


3658
03:01:37.100 --> 03:01:40.300
In 2009 when the Gemini face started so it's


3659
03:01:40.300 --> 03:01:43.700
interesting to see what he had to say because he wrote it before it


3660
03:01:43.700 --> 03:01:46.000
really kicked in it it just kind of started.


3661
03:01:46.800 --> 03:01:50.000
It's interesting like 2008 with


3662
03:01:49.100 --> 03:01:53.000
the financial crisis. And then the the government bailouts


3663
03:01:52.900 --> 03:01:55.500
government bailouts was all part


3664
03:01:55.500 --> 03:01:58.700
of politics was all part of the Gemini phase


3665
03:01:58.700 --> 03:02:01.000
and it's not a line right cusps are not I mean,


3666
03:02:01.200 --> 03:02:04.100
they are lines between houses. I'll talk about that when I talk about


3667
03:02:04.100 --> 03:02:07.700
angles, but these phases overlap because energy


3668
03:02:07.700 --> 03:02:10.500
is not like this energy doesn't have walls.


3669
03:02:10.500 --> 03:02:13.800
It does this and it works like this and it


3670
03:02:13.800 --> 03:02:17.000
you know infuses and that's when we get into like aspects.


3671
03:02:16.300 --> 03:02:19.900
We'll talk more about how energy melds together.


3672
03:02:21.400 --> 03:02:26.200
But when we're going through different phases going from


3673
03:02:26.200 --> 03:02:29.300
the Gemini phase to the cancer phase you're actually dealing


3674
03:02:29.300 --> 03:02:32.600
with so much energy. We're dealing with the third ninth


3675
03:02:32.600 --> 03:02:35.500
house axis and the fourth tenth house axis all at


3676
03:02:35.500 --> 03:02:38.500
the same time for the last couple of years, which is why that work


3677
03:02:38.500 --> 03:02:41.200
from home thing with politics was all


3678
03:02:41.200 --> 03:02:44.900
infused because work from home was the fourth tenth the politics


3679
03:02:44.900 --> 03:02:47.100
and the separation from the lockdowns was the third


3680
03:02:47.100 --> 03:02:50.800
and Ninth but all of that was fusing together because of that overlap in


3681
03:02:50.800 --> 03:02:51.900
energy changing phases.


3682
03:02:52.800 --> 03:02:54.300
But this is where you would go. It's


3683
03:02:58.300 --> 03:03:01.500
it's on Astros website. I wonder if I can just search it.


3684
03:03:02.700 --> 03:03:04.900
astrological ages


3685
03:03:09.400 --> 03:03:12.100
Yeah, it's the first thing that pops up. It's this one here. So when you go to


3686
03:03:12.100 --> 03:03:15.700
astro.com's website type in astrological ages.


3687
03:03:16.500 --> 03:03:19.300
And it's actually astrological ages as an accurate


3688
03:03:19.300 --> 03:03:22.800
and effective model of History. It's an amazing fascinating.


3689
03:03:22.800 --> 03:03:25.000
This is how I got into it and I got really in tune


3690
03:03:25.200 --> 03:03:25.600
to it because


3691
03:03:26.500 --> 03:03:29.300
you're trying to figure out how you can align with energies. Well, you


3692
03:03:29.300 --> 03:03:32.600
should know what the biggest energies are. The biggest themes working


3693
03:03:32.600 --> 03:03:35.500
from home right now. It's supposed to be how do


3694
03:03:35.500 --> 03:03:38.700
you take that and do that for yourself? How do you work using cancer energy?


3695
03:03:38.700 --> 03:03:41.900
How do you nurture? How do you heal? How do you do agriculture? A


3696
03:03:41.900 --> 03:03:44.300
lot of people are looking into you know


3697
03:03:44.300 --> 03:03:47.300
farming at home? Like they want to start their own little Farms you're


3698
03:03:47.300 --> 03:03:49.200
hearing that all the time because it's the phase of cancer.


3699
03:03:50.300 --> 03:03:52.200
So that's that for that.


3700
03:03:53.600 --> 03:03:56.400
Most entertaining all thank


3701
03:03:56.400 --> 03:03:56.900
you, Danny.


3702
03:03:57.400 --> 03:04:00.900
And witty witty, I'm gonna take that amazing compliment


3703
03:04:00.900 --> 03:04:03.800
explain things very well. Thank you Valerie. It's


3704
03:04:03.800 --> 03:04:06.600
not boring at all. It's amazing. Thank you Angie. I appreciate that. That


3705
03:04:06.600 --> 03:04:09.200
was my fear. My fear was that you guys wouldn't enjoy


3706
03:04:10.900 --> 03:04:11.300
but I'm glad


3707
03:04:12.300 --> 03:04:15.200
Angeles's I've taken several classes. I think you did


3708
03:04:15.200 --> 03:04:18.700
a great job all my air understands and enjoys this type of presentation awesome.


3709
03:04:19.800 --> 03:04:22.100
Awesome. I appreciate that Jen. Thank you for your knowledge


3710
03:04:22.100 --> 03:04:25.100
of science course very helpful and interesting. I have a hard time focusing and keeping my


3711
03:04:25.100 --> 03:04:26.500
attention but not for this class.


3712
03:04:29.400 --> 03:04:31.000
Awesome. Thank you again. Thank you.


3713
03:04:32.500 --> 03:04:35.500
Taylor as you cast an election chart not a natal chart


3714
03:04:35.500 --> 03:04:38.600
so you cast yes, it's called an election chart. It's technically


3715
03:04:38.600 --> 03:04:41.200
the same thing you're going in. But when you do


3716
03:04:41.200 --> 03:04:44.300
male female you'll see where it says event you just click event


3717
03:04:44.300 --> 03:04:47.300
and you're using the time of birth for the


3718
03:04:47.300 --> 03:04:50.300
LLC or whatever. It is from the legal


3719
03:04:50.300 --> 03:04:53.300
documents. And then that creates the first breath of


3720
03:04:53.300 --> 03:04:56.300
life where it's actually a real entity and you use that


3721
03:04:56.300 --> 03:04:59.300
to decide what it is. So for instance, I don't mind


3722
03:04:59.300 --> 03:05:02.200
showing people and forever and ever and ever


3723
03:05:02.200 --> 03:05:06.000
that you guys can learn. This is Mystic Rebels LLC


3724
03:05:05.200 --> 03:05:08.900
from December 7th, 2021. It


3725
03:05:08.900 --> 03:05:11.400
was time stamped on our Florida document in


3726
03:05:11.400 --> 03:05:14.700
the insurance. Florida is where we did that it's the same in Tallahassee,


3727
03:05:14.700 --> 03:05:15.500
which is where it is.


3728
03:05:16.300 --> 03:05:20.000
I guess legally done but we did it from here. I could


3729
03:05:19.200 --> 03:05:22.600
have done it from there. It's the same chart. I looked at both 8 am.


3730
03:05:23.600 --> 03:05:26.600
And this is it. This is us doing spiritual occult


3731
03:05:26.600 --> 03:05:29.800
work. This is us being teachers like we were always destined


3732
03:05:29.800 --> 03:05:32.400
to be teaching which is so interesting. It also rules


3733
03:05:32.400 --> 03:05:35.900
astrology, which is why that's kind of at the Forefront right now is talks


3734
03:05:35.900 --> 03:05:38.100
about the money that can be made this talks about


3735
03:05:38.100 --> 03:05:41.500
the communication and how the internet and structures


3736
03:05:41.500 --> 03:05:43.000
and this this right here.


3737
03:05:43.900 --> 03:05:46.400
And this right here actually are our


3738
03:05:46.400 --> 03:05:49.200
platform that we're about to launch. It actually says


3739
03:05:49.200 --> 03:05:52.400
it right here that we're gonna launch a platform. So it's not just like Hey, we're


3740
03:05:52.400 --> 03:05:55.800
talking about it. No, and we know that the developers are and


3741
03:05:55.800 --> 03:05:58.400
at the tail end of the website and then the


3742
03:05:58.400 --> 03:06:00.200
developing the app so we can launch


3743
03:06:01.400 --> 03:06:04.800
this talks about doing all this from home, which we do also the


3744
03:06:04.800 --> 03:06:08.100
intuitive nurturing nature Chiron here


3745
03:06:08.100 --> 03:06:11.100
is in areas is you know, the fifth house here


3746
03:06:11.100 --> 03:06:14.400
six, I you know, I'm not gonna go through everything but you know, the ninth


3747
03:06:14.400 --> 03:06:17.500
House of teaching is in the first house and Sagittarius again teaching


3748
03:06:17.500 --> 03:06:20.200
teaching teaching which is why we're not going to be doing as many


3749
03:06:21.900 --> 03:06:24.900
Chart readings in the future we're


3750
03:06:24.900 --> 03:06:27.200
going to do as many as we can now, but we're


3751
03:06:27.200 --> 03:06:31.100
going to be doing mostly teaching because we want to curate the future healers as


3752
03:06:30.100 --> 03:06:33.800
opposed to just giving people readings, but we'll


3753
03:06:33.800 --> 03:06:36.100
keep our VIPs and keep reading for them as well.


3754
03:06:37.600 --> 03:06:40.400
Thank you huge effort. Thank you, Julie. I appreciate that.


3755
03:06:41.700 --> 03:06:43.200
like jet streams


3756
03:06:45.300 --> 03:06:48.500
I don't know what that means actually Brandy like jet streams.


3757
03:06:50.800 --> 03:06:54.000
I'll come back to that if you answer that and Danny


3758
03:06:53.200 --> 03:06:56.300
whenever you spoke about timing on your tiktoks,


3759
03:06:56.300 --> 03:06:59.200
are you just following the moon and where exactly do you get that


3760
03:06:59.200 --> 03:07:02.300
info? So by the end of the course you will


3761
03:07:02.300 --> 03:07:05.200
know exactly what I'm talking about as a preface.


3762
03:07:06.200 --> 03:07:09.600
When I click the transits button, which you can't see it's up here


3763
03:07:09.600 --> 03:07:12.200
next to chart selection. These green energies that


3764
03:07:12.200 --> 03:07:16.300
you see around here are transits the black glyphs


3765
03:07:15.300 --> 03:07:18.400
here are my energies meaning when


3766
03:07:18.400 --> 03:07:21.100
I was born. This is where everything was this is the snapshot that


3767
03:07:21.100 --> 03:07:24.600
became my Cosmic blueprint. The green is the moving energies


3768
03:07:24.600 --> 03:07:27.300
out in the solar system. They're they're constantly moving


3769
03:07:27.300 --> 03:07:30.500
and moving around and they're impacting things.


3770
03:07:30.500 --> 03:07:31.800
So Mars is over.


3771
03:07:32.700 --> 03:07:35.400
But this is oh, this is Mystic Rebels and


3772
03:07:35.400 --> 03:07:37.700
that's interesting Mars is over the North Node right now.


3773
03:07:38.500 --> 03:07:41.400
I actually didn't even look at this. The Moon is over


3774
03:07:41.400 --> 03:07:44.500
Pluto and Venus which is value and structure


3775
03:07:44.500 --> 03:07:44.900
and all that.


3776
03:07:45.800 --> 03:07:49.400
Which is great. I love that Saturn. This


3777
03:07:48.400 --> 03:07:51.400
is crazy. Y'all Saturn is


3778
03:07:51.400 --> 03:07:54.200
over Jupiter. I didn't look at this prior to you asking me


3779
03:07:54.200 --> 03:07:57.400
this question Saturn's over Jupiter, which is over the first


3780
03:07:57.400 --> 03:07:58.700
house, which is also teaching.


3781
03:07:59.800 --> 03:08:02.500
And then value and communication online.


3782
03:08:02.500 --> 03:08:05.200
So it's like all of this goes together


3783
03:08:05.200 --> 03:08:08.600
Uranus while I wasn't started that long ago. So that makes sense and the


3784
03:08:08.600 --> 03:08:11.200
North Node over the sixth house and bringing value


3785
03:08:11.200 --> 03:08:14.700
to day to day. It's like this is this is crazy in


3786
03:08:14.700 --> 03:08:17.500
Jupiter over Chiron. I love


3787
03:08:17.500 --> 03:08:20.800
this because it's our our for our chart ruler


3788
03:08:20.800 --> 03:08:23.100
is over Chiron in the fifth house.


3789
03:08:24.100 --> 03:08:27.200
This is beautiful. This is healing for a lot of you


3790
03:08:27.200 --> 03:08:30.500
guys. This is going to be healing your inner child, whether you're live or


3791
03:08:30.500 --> 03:08:33.400
you're watching this later you're going to be healing we're teaching


3792
03:08:33.400 --> 03:08:36.100
you how to heal ha and that's what we're


3793
03:08:36.100 --> 03:08:39.400
supposed to do. And I just I can't like


3794
03:08:39.400 --> 03:08:42.300
the sun is going over the ruler of our midheaven.


3795
03:08:43.300 --> 03:08:46.900
And like I said in future classes you're going to be able to do a


3796
03:08:46.900 --> 03:08:49.000
lot of what I'm doing not everything you're gonna have to keep


3797
03:08:49.300 --> 03:08:52.300
learning. I'm a forever student. You'll be a forever student


3798
03:08:52.300 --> 03:08:53.100
and


3799
03:08:54.400 --> 03:08:58.000
Forever student is going to be one of our our T-shirts


3800
03:08:57.700 --> 03:09:00.800
because that's just how it is with spirituality and


3801
03:09:00.800 --> 03:09:03.500
with astrology. You'll always dive down


3802
03:09:03.500 --> 03:09:05.500
this this Rabbit Hole. I promise you.


3803
03:09:08.600 --> 03:09:11.200
Randy Energy's coming together. Yeah, I guess that's the way


3804
03:09:11.200 --> 03:09:14.900
you could look at it energy is coming together like jet streams ice I visualize


3805
03:09:15.900 --> 03:09:18.400
Balls of energy almost like light


3806
03:09:18.400 --> 03:09:21.200
if you shine a let's just make it easy. If


3807
03:09:21.200 --> 03:09:24.500
you shine a red light you shine a yellow light that's a


3808
03:09:24.500 --> 03:09:27.100
yellow light and a red light and they are what they are. But when they come


3809
03:09:27.100 --> 03:09:30.100
together, they create an orange light and to realize that if


3810
03:09:30.100 --> 03:09:32.400
you're looking for orange, or you could use crayons, I guess in the same.


3811
03:09:33.100 --> 03:09:34.900
metaphor analogy, but


3812
03:09:36.600 --> 03:09:39.300
that's how I see it and I love it.


3813
03:09:39.300 --> 03:09:41.500
And here's the thing about manifestation.


3814
03:09:42.500 --> 03:09:45.600
This is it's this I'm gonna regurgitate my Pluto


3815
03:09:45.600 --> 03:09:48.500
in the third. I'm going to regurgitate what my martial arts


3816
03:09:48.500 --> 03:09:51.200
instructor told me when I was like 11 to 12 years old.


3817
03:09:52.300 --> 03:09:55.500
Because it applies to this and applies to manifestation used to


3818
03:09:55.500 --> 03:09:58.200
have all these different sayings one of them which is


3819
03:09:58.200 --> 03:10:01.700
a part of manifestation is to remove yourself


3820
03:10:01.700 --> 03:10:05.000
from toxic situations and toxic people anything that


3821
03:10:04.300 --> 03:10:07.500
goes against what you want is holding you


3822
03:10:07.500 --> 03:10:10.300
back because it becomes a part of your life part of your energy part of


3823
03:10:10.300 --> 03:10:13.200
your mindset. He used to say one of the two things was


3824
03:10:14.100 --> 03:10:17.100
if you stick your hands in garbage, you'll smell like trash too.


3825
03:10:18.300 --> 03:10:21.000
And it stuck with me obviously for 30 more years.


3826
03:10:21.800 --> 03:10:24.700
And it comes down to you. He


3827
03:10:24.700 --> 03:10:27.400
was referencing. You know, who you hang out with


3828
03:10:27.400 --> 03:10:30.700
and The Company You Keep but it's it goes


3829
03:10:30.700 --> 03:10:33.100
beyond just your friends. It goes to your


3830
03:10:33.100 --> 03:10:36.100
family. It goes to your work acquaintances. It goes to your


3831
03:10:36.100 --> 03:10:39.300
job. It goes to every aspect to your life. It goes to the if you


3832
03:10:39.300 --> 03:10:41.200
go drink and you go out to the bar, it's them.


3833
03:10:42.300 --> 03:10:45.300
Who are you hanging out with are they the type of people and you'll


3834
03:10:45.300 --> 03:10:48.300
see inspirational videos on social media saying are you hanging


3835
03:10:48.300 --> 03:10:51.300
out with people who are at your level or lower


3836
03:10:51.300 --> 03:10:54.100
or you hanging out Pete with people who got it? They got


3837
03:10:54.100 --> 03:10:57.200
it made they got it together that you want to Aspire to you always want


3838
03:10:57.200 --> 03:10:58.200
to hire hang out with them.


3839
03:10:59.100 --> 03:11:02.500
And at some point when you're at the top keep the closest people who have supported


3840
03:11:02.500 --> 03:11:05.400
you and always had your back. The second thing is he


3841
03:11:05.400 --> 03:11:08.200
used to talk about how when you have a red light


3842
03:11:08.200 --> 03:11:11.600
if you take a light and you just shine red light. It's just


3843
03:11:11.600 --> 03:11:14.000
a red light doesn't hurt you. It just puts a


3844
03:11:14.300 --> 03:11:17.800
pigment on your skin a hue whatever and there's nothing


3845
03:11:17.800 --> 03:11:20.500
dangerous or damaging about it. But if you take that same


3846
03:11:20.500 --> 03:11:23.200
light and you take all that light and you focus it in


3847
03:11:23.200 --> 03:11:27.100
on one spot, it becomes a laser and a


3848
03:11:26.100 --> 03:11:28.100
laser can cut diamonds.


3849
03:11:28.800 --> 03:11:31.500
And this is all about manifestation. This is all about using


3850
03:11:31.500 --> 03:11:34.300
your energy. This is all about Focus. This is all about taking


3851
03:11:34.300 --> 03:11:37.600
saturnian energy that focus and discipline. It's also


3852
03:11:37.600 --> 03:11:40.300
about discipline Saturn. It's about so many things but


3853
03:11:40.300 --> 03:11:41.400
it's all in the same, you know.


3854
03:11:42.700 --> 03:11:43.100
sphere


3855
03:11:44.200 --> 03:11:47.700
It's about taking that light all this energy that you have and


3856
03:11:47.700 --> 03:11:50.500
finding that pinpoint laser focus so that


3857
03:11:50.500 --> 03:11:53.600
you can cut diamonds so you can literally do anything which


3858
03:11:53.600 --> 03:11:56.200
is what the point is, right. He was talking about


3859
03:11:56.200 --> 03:11:59.400
energy in martial arts and it being


3860
03:11:59.400 --> 03:12:02.300
dispersed versus having that focus and hitting the point that


3861
03:12:02.300 --> 03:12:05.400
you wanted but when it comes to manifestation it talks


3862
03:12:05.400 --> 03:12:08.400
about this is the thing I want and I've got to focus everything here


3863
03:12:08.400 --> 03:12:11.300
and I've got to be there which also brings the other element


3864
03:12:11.300 --> 03:12:14.400
of when you punch when you were breaking concrete or


3865
03:12:14.400 --> 03:12:17.500
breaking wood and essentially breaking bones when you


3866
03:12:17.500 --> 03:12:20.300
punch you don't need it. You don't think I'm going up


3867
03:12:20.300 --> 03:12:23.900
to it. You aim past it you overshoot you


3868
03:12:23.900 --> 03:12:27.000
go through it and your goal is


3869
03:12:26.200 --> 03:12:28.000
to mentally


3870
03:12:29.400 --> 03:12:32.600
um C to mentally picture already being


3871
03:12:32.600 --> 03:12:35.200
through it. That's how you break boards in martial arts.


3872
03:12:35.200 --> 03:12:38.600
That's how you break concrete. It's already broken. I actually


3873
03:12:38.600 --> 03:12:41.800
ironically I do this when I open jars like


3874
03:12:41.800 --> 03:12:43.800
pickle jars or sauerkraut or whatever I'm opening.


3875
03:12:44.700 --> 03:12:47.200
And my wife gets a kick out of it. I will sit there and try


3876
03:12:47.200 --> 03:12:50.300
to turn it and I'll forget and like it's hard and I'll just sit there.


3877
03:12:50.300 --> 03:12:53.400
I breathe in I breathe out. I picture it already open


3878
03:12:53.400 --> 03:12:57.400
and I say I verbally say open and


3879
03:12:56.400 --> 03:12:59.400
literally it feels like no energy. It's


3880
03:12:59.400 --> 03:12:59.700
just open.


3881
03:13:00.500 --> 03:13:03.400
And it takes a lot of dedication a


3882
03:13:03.400 --> 03:13:06.300
lot of focus to get to that point, but that's what you're doing is you're


3883
03:13:06.300 --> 03:13:09.300
taking all this dedication all this energy and you're focusing


3884
03:13:09.300 --> 03:13:12.400
it in where you want and then Divine timing has


3885
03:13:12.400 --> 03:13:15.200
to do with when these energies come around and they open up


3886
03:13:15.200 --> 03:13:18.500
there's two steps one is your energies. How do


3887
03:13:18.500 --> 03:13:21.300
your energies work out? What can you do the second step


3888
03:13:21.300 --> 03:13:24.200
is when can you do it? That's the transits.


3889
03:13:24.700 --> 03:13:25.800
Who what? Why where when


3890
03:13:26.700 --> 03:13:29.100
the when is the green as it comes along


3891
03:13:29.100 --> 03:13:32.500
and you get opportunities this energy this outward Force


3892
03:13:32.500 --> 03:13:36.100
that's pushing in and saying I'm going to bring in this creativity


3893
03:13:35.100 --> 03:13:38.300
this Vitality. I'm going to shine a light


3894
03:13:38.300 --> 03:13:41.700
on this and I'm in with Pluto. I'm going to transform it.


3895
03:13:41.700 --> 03:13:44.500
I'm going to go really deep. I'm gonna potentially be


3896
03:13:44.500 --> 03:13:47.200
upheaval and make you change in the sun with it


3897
03:13:47.200 --> 03:13:49.800
is making it combust so it's making it.


3898
03:13:50.700 --> 03:13:53.700
It's actually amplifying it a lot of people say that it lowers


3899
03:13:53.700 --> 03:13:56.300
the Vitality. But for me, it sets it


3900
03:13:56.300 --> 03:13:59.200
on fire is the way that I see it. I don't like the


3901
03:13:59.200 --> 03:14:02.300
term combust in the way that they use it. I like it the way I use it


3902
03:14:02.300 --> 03:14:05.600
because I like to use this energy and I like when it's combust.


3903
03:14:05.600 --> 03:14:08.400
It's like hell, yeah. It's that issues on


3904
03:14:08.400 --> 03:14:11.600
fire. And but anyway, this is the when so


3905
03:14:11.600 --> 03:14:12.400
to answer your question.


3906
03:14:13.200 --> 03:14:16.700
We're gonna get into transits, but that is how you that's how


3907
03:14:16.700 --> 03:14:18.200
you know when that's Divine timing.


3908
03:14:19.200 --> 03:14:22.500
Taylor thank you so much for this. I taught myself the basics but this took it


3909
03:14:22.500 --> 03:14:25.800
to a deeper level of understanding. That's what I was hoping for really looking


3910
03:14:25.800 --> 03:14:28.600
forward to upcoming classes for people who have already learned the


3911
03:14:28.600 --> 03:14:31.300
basics of astrology. A lot of people were asking me do


3912
03:14:31.300 --> 03:14:32.900
I need this class and like


3913
03:14:34.100 --> 03:14:37.400
of course, I'm selling it. I'm teaching it. I want to say yes, but


3914
03:14:37.400 --> 03:14:40.400
I also want to be honest. It's like I don't I don't know. I don't


3915
03:14:40.400 --> 03:14:43.300
know how well you taught it. I don't know who you learned from. I don't


3916
03:14:43.300 --> 03:14:46.200
know if it's accurate when I do my readings it's all about


3917
03:14:46.200 --> 03:14:49.400
accuracy. If something's off either the time is off or I missed


3918
03:14:49.400 --> 03:14:52.900
something and I have to go back and figure out what I missed some people


3919
03:14:52.900 --> 03:14:55.300
start to easier to read than others, but that's the whole


3920
03:14:55.300 --> 03:14:56.400
goal of it. So


3921
03:14:57.300 --> 03:15:00.400
that's what that's all about. I want you to have accuracy if


3922
03:15:00.400 --> 03:15:02.100
it doesn't work every single time.


3923
03:15:03.100 --> 03:15:04.000
Why learn it?


3924
03:15:04.800 --> 03:15:07.500
Why learn it that's my problem with that's always


3925
03:15:07.500 --> 03:15:10.800
been my problem with astrology every reading. I've gotten Hit


3926
03:15:10.800 --> 03:15:13.500
or Miss Vedic tropical doesn't


3927
03:15:13.500 --> 03:15:16.200
matter. They're all using classes as Health Systems probably why but some


3928
03:15:16.200 --> 03:15:19.400
of it is just them they don't understand how to pull it all together.


3929
03:15:20.300 --> 03:15:23.300
And they're very surface. Once they say Mars in the


3930
03:15:23.300 --> 03:15:26.800
in Scorpio Mars in the 12th house. That's it. They leave it and maybe


3931
03:15:26.800 --> 03:15:29.800
they get into aspects. Maybe they say hey, there's an agitation a


3932
03:15:29.800 --> 03:15:33.200
semi sex tile with the ascendant of the business being able


3933
03:15:33.200 --> 03:15:36.300
to do, you know certain things behind the scenes who which we have


3934
03:15:36.300 --> 03:15:39.600
we've had difficulty behind the scenes because we're always teaching we


3935
03:15:39.600 --> 03:15:43.700
can't be doing both. So we've actually had this experience but


3936
03:15:42.700 --> 03:15:45.200
they don't go into that. They don't go into


3937
03:15:45.200 --> 03:15:48.700
on top of that Pluto. Where's Pluto Pluto's


3938
03:15:48.700 --> 03:15:51.400
down here? What's Pluto aspecting bring all this energy back


3939
03:15:51.400 --> 03:15:54.700
into the 12th house? Also we're talking about Mars Mars is


3940
03:15:54.700 --> 03:15:57.600
the ruler of Aries. Oh, there's Chiron here. How are


3941
03:15:57.600 --> 03:16:00.500
we using Chiron as a healing or is it helping is it pain


3942
03:16:00.500 --> 03:16:03.500
or is it, you know nurturing and it's it's


3943
03:16:03.500 --> 03:16:07.000
all of this here. And then Chiron is aspecting


3944
03:16:06.600 --> 03:16:09.400
Saturn with a sex tile. You have to bring


3945
03:16:09.400 --> 03:16:12.400
the third house energy back into the twelfth house. It gets


3946
03:16:12.400 --> 03:16:15.900
very complex very quickly, but


3947
03:16:15.900 --> 03:16:19.300
it yields such accurate fine-tuned


3948
03:16:18.300 --> 03:16:20.200
details that when


3949
03:16:20.400 --> 03:16:23.900
learn how to do this. You're not going to do it tomorrow. It took


3950
03:16:23.900 --> 03:16:26.100
me seven years to get to this point. I'm not saying


3951
03:16:26.900 --> 03:16:29.400
And that's things gonna take you seven years because I'm


3952
03:16:29.400 --> 03:16:32.300
I'm killing off eliminating like


3953
03:16:32.300 --> 03:16:35.300
three plus three to four of


3954
03:16:35.300 --> 03:16:39.100
those years, maybe three of those years of sifting


3955
03:16:38.100 --> 03:16:42.100
through the garbage that's out there for astrology


3956
03:16:41.100 --> 03:16:45.200
on these different websites and books and podcasts and


3957
03:16:45.200 --> 03:16:48.400
YouTube videos and whatnot so that I can teach you what does


3958
03:16:48.400 --> 03:16:51.100
work so you don't have to worry about what doesn't work. I'm just teaching you


3959
03:16:51.100 --> 03:16:54.000
what works you're jumping ahead a couple of years. I'm saving you the time.


3960
03:16:55.500 --> 03:16:58.500
So if you are nowhere near your birth certificate should you


3961
03:16:58.500 --> 03:17:01.300
change the location to your current city? Your natal chart


3962
03:17:01.300 --> 03:17:03.800
energies will always apply. However.


3963
03:17:04.800 --> 03:17:07.600
You also need to add in your relocated energies


3964
03:17:07.600 --> 03:17:10.200
because they act as a layer on top and we will be doing


3965
03:17:10.200 --> 03:17:13.200
an astro cartography course so that


3966
03:17:13.200 --> 03:17:16.200
you can understand that you're using both of these energies and


3967
03:17:16.200 --> 03:17:19.600
what it does is it fine-tunes. I just did a video on tiktok about


3968
03:17:19.600 --> 03:17:22.600
this where basically you're taking these energies


3969
03:17:22.600 --> 03:17:25.400
and these energies and I use the analogy of buying


3970
03:17:25.400 --> 03:17:28.100
a car and saying that if your mid had been was buying a


3971
03:17:28.100 --> 03:17:31.700
car right your life purpose was to go buy this car and there was


3972
03:17:31.700 --> 03:17:34.300
and to break it down simple as possible the analogy. I


3973
03:17:34.300 --> 03:17:37.500
think I said something along the lines up. It's there's Mars and


3974
03:17:37.500 --> 03:17:39.200
Saturn energy in your natal chart.


3975
03:17:40.100 --> 03:17:43.300
And let's say Saturn is it has to be strong. It has


3976
03:17:43.300 --> 03:17:46.300
to be durable. Maybe an older car. Maybe a used vehicle


3977
03:17:46.300 --> 03:17:49.200
is something that's gonna last it could be the bare minimum. I


3978
03:17:49.200 --> 03:17:53.000
don't need anything fancy and then Mars energy


3979
03:17:52.300 --> 03:17:55.000
says I do need to be powerful and I do


3980
03:17:55.200 --> 03:17:56.800
need to make a presence and be strong.


3981
03:17:57.700 --> 03:18:00.400
So those two energies and then you've driven when


3982
03:18:00.400 --> 03:18:03.400
you live in your natal area. That's what you've always driven. But then


3983
03:18:03.400 --> 03:18:06.500
you move somewhere else is completely different and let's say that mid haven't changes


3984
03:18:06.500 --> 03:18:09.500
and now you're adding in Venus and Uranus.


3985
03:18:09.500 --> 03:18:12.200
Well Venus is all about luxury. It's all


3986
03:18:12.200 --> 03:18:16.000
about value and then Uranus is all about technology. So


3987
03:18:15.300 --> 03:18:18.400
now you're bringing in saying that old vehicle


3988
03:18:18.400 --> 03:18:21.500
that you used to only need for, you know getting from


3989
03:18:21.500 --> 03:18:24.300
A to B and having a powerful engine. Maybe it was an old


3990
03:18:24.300 --> 03:18:25.600
muscle car is what you had


3991
03:18:26.300 --> 03:18:29.200
And didn't have any Tech it was whatever and you love that thing because that's exactly


3992
03:18:29.200 --> 03:18:32.100
what you wanted. But now you're somewhere else and now it needs


3993
03:18:32.100 --> 03:18:35.400
to be luxurious. So it's not necessarily new because


3994
03:18:35.400 --> 03:18:38.700
you still have Saturn's energy, but it's gonna


3995
03:18:38.700 --> 03:18:41.400
have luxury to us. And now the next one you buy might


3996
03:18:41.400 --> 03:18:44.700
have leather seats. It might have like a couple


3997
03:18:44.700 --> 03:18:47.500
of features to the other didn't it might have a sunroof and


3998
03:18:47.500 --> 03:18:48.400
then you bring in


3999
03:18:50.300 --> 03:18:53.300
And then you bring in Uranus energy now, it has more


4000
03:18:53.300 --> 03:18:56.300
Tech now. It's got GPS and now it's got you


4001
03:18:56.300 --> 03:18:59.800
know, heads up display or whatever. So now the new car it's


4002
03:18:59.800 --> 03:19:02.600
not just Venus and Uranus. It's all four


4003
03:19:02.600 --> 03:19:05.300
of those energies. So when you're doing relocation, you


4004
03:19:05.300 --> 03:19:08.400
have to look at both of those and it it just adds


4005
03:19:08.400 --> 03:19:11.600
it adds energy and it changes things the


4006
03:19:11.600 --> 03:19:13.000
reason why when I went


4007
03:19:16.600 --> 03:19:19.200
Mr. Rebels whoops. This is


4008
03:19:19.200 --> 03:19:23.000
my chart. So the reason why when I went from working commission


4009
03:19:22.500 --> 03:19:25.100
jobs, and I was a server a couple


4010
03:19:25.100 --> 03:19:28.900
times and doing those kind of jobs and I moved to, California.


4011
03:19:30.100 --> 03:19:33.000
And in California, I developed and I'll show you


4012
03:19:33.200 --> 03:19:33.900
what happens there.


4013
03:19:35.800 --> 03:19:37.500
in Los Angeles


4014
03:19:40.300 --> 03:19:42.500
nothing happens when you don't hit in the Box.


4015
03:19:43.600 --> 03:19:46.500
When you go into Los Angeles, California, and then


4016
03:19:46.500 --> 03:19:49.300
I switch this again. This is going to be for a different class. Maybe even


4017
03:19:49.300 --> 03:19:52.900
a different course when I go here my


4018
03:19:52.900 --> 03:19:55.300
mid Heaven ends up in the ninth house instead of the tenth


4019
03:19:55.300 --> 03:19:58.400
house and it's in Pisces. I become a cancer Rising


4020
03:19:58.400 --> 03:20:01.600
my son shifted from the 11th to the 12th house. What ended


4021
03:20:01.600 --> 03:20:04.600
up happening is I became a film producer director. I did


4022
03:20:04.600 --> 03:20:07.700
not become an actor even though I had a tenth house


4023
03:20:07.700 --> 03:20:10.100
midheaven in Taurus with Venus there which is


4024
03:20:10.100 --> 03:20:12.800
the Arts. I've always been an artist and in


4025
03:20:14.800 --> 03:20:18.000
And been in in that kind of interest and instead


4026
03:20:17.100 --> 03:20:20.400
of it me being able to be an actor


4027
03:20:20.400 --> 03:20:23.300
even though I have the son in the 11th. I always got there and then


4028
03:20:23.300 --> 03:20:26.200
I ended up doing background work. So I'm in the


4029
03:20:26.200 --> 03:20:29.600
thing as a part of the group but in the background and


4030
03:20:29.600 --> 03:20:32.400
then I ended up using this energy on knowingly actually


4031
03:20:32.400 --> 03:20:35.300
took me years and instead of that. I became a


4032
03:20:35.300 --> 03:20:38.300
screenwriter a director a producer of multiple projects and


4033
03:20:38.300 --> 03:20:42.000
multiple Realms and instead of Pisces being


4034
03:20:41.500 --> 03:20:43.800
hospitals or


4035
03:20:46.700 --> 03:20:49.800
Hospitals or like music it ended


4036
03:20:49.800 --> 03:20:52.200
up being because of this energy. Actually I did


4037
03:20:52.200 --> 03:20:55.300
do music and then I moved over to film it ended up


4038
03:20:55.300 --> 03:20:56.600
being a film.


4039
03:20:57.700 --> 03:21:00.000
So instead of hospitals that ended up being filmed.


4040
03:21:01.600 --> 03:21:04.800
One I don't have any Virgo service to others energy my


4041
03:21:04.800 --> 03:21:07.200
sixth house had this here. So actually this


4042
03:21:07.200 --> 03:21:10.300
could have been Medical but because my natal chart


4043
03:21:10.300 --> 03:21:13.500
has Capricorn here, which is boss energy


4044
03:21:13.500 --> 03:21:16.500
and then has a mid


4045
03:21:16.500 --> 03:21:19.200
heaven in Taurus. That's the Arts. It's why it ended up


4046
03:21:19.200 --> 03:21:22.600
film and not medicine and why I owned my own company out


4047
03:21:22.600 --> 03:21:25.300
there because it's in the in the ninth house. Again, that's for


4048
03:21:25.300 --> 03:21:25.600
another.


4049
03:21:27.400 --> 03:21:30.100
Class in the following classes where you teach us how


4050
03:21:30.100 --> 03:21:33.800
to read the lines without having to get on apps. I


4051
03:21:33.800 --> 03:21:36.600
will be teaching you. Actually I


4052
03:21:36.600 --> 03:21:37.300
don't read lines.


4053
03:21:38.400 --> 03:21:41.300
I don't read lines. So you're gonna learn how I read these lines


4054
03:21:41.300 --> 03:21:42.300
are extremely confusing.


4055
03:21:43.100 --> 03:21:46.200
This is a ball of yarn to me. Now. Some people this is really


4056
03:21:46.200 --> 03:21:49.200
exciting. And if you add in more aspects, it just


4057
03:21:49.200 --> 03:21:52.700
becomes a jumbled up mess. I I glance at


4058
03:21:52.700 --> 03:21:55.200
them to see like here I see the


4059
03:21:55.200 --> 03:21:58.800
grand Trine and then I see the the kite what


4060
03:21:58.800 --> 03:22:01.300
I do is I look at planets the major


4061
03:22:01.300 --> 03:22:05.500
planets and I look at their degrees. So I see 2521 all


4062
03:22:05.500 --> 03:22:08.600
in the air signs 25:21 and 24.


4063
03:22:08.600 --> 03:22:11.500
This is my grand Trine and I see another 25, that's the


4064
03:22:11.500 --> 03:22:14.100
kite because it's in opposition. So I'm gonna teach you


4065
03:22:14.100 --> 03:22:16.500
that but also all the aspects are actually down here.


4066
03:22:17.800 --> 03:22:20.300
So when we're looking at all of this, this is where you


4067
03:22:20.300 --> 03:22:23.700
I double check if I'm not sure like some


4068
03:22:23.700 --> 03:22:26.700
of them like a queen kunk's is only about two degrees orb


4069
03:22:26.700 --> 03:22:28.400
of influence and if I can't tell if it's like


4070
03:22:29.700 --> 03:22:32.200
With the minutes and everything if it's within I'll just come


4071
03:22:32.200 --> 03:22:35.300
down here and double check some of them like this one right here


4072
03:22:35.300 --> 03:22:38.900
that I have. I know this Queen Cooks within one degree. I'll double


4073
03:22:38.900 --> 03:22:41.200
check it but I don't actually use this much


4074
03:22:41.200 --> 03:22:43.600
other than reference. I use the numbers.


4075
03:22:45.600 --> 03:22:49.000
But I will show you that when we start talking about aspects my


4076
03:22:48.400 --> 03:22:51.200
Jupiter is about to be over Chiron. I've been healing


4077
03:22:51.200 --> 03:22:53.000
so much. Yeah, Melissa, that's


4078
03:22:53.900 --> 03:22:54.700
That's amazing.


4079
03:22:55.600 --> 03:22:58.900
Learning learning will help you heal because that's what Jupiter's


4080
03:22:58.900 --> 03:22:59.100
all about.


4081
03:22:59.900 --> 03:23:02.500
Angie if you ever doubt yourself have a bad day in


4082
03:23:02.500 --> 03:23:06.000
your business rewatch the last 10 minutes and you explaining


4083
03:23:05.100 --> 03:23:07.800
this business chart love it.


4084
03:23:08.500 --> 03:23:11.200
Fired up and passion coming through when you speak about this in the


4085
03:23:11.200 --> 03:23:14.000
chart and the reasons behind it. Super cool be proud. Thank you


4086
03:23:14.600 --> 03:23:16.400
Angie. I appreciate that so much guys.


4087
03:23:18.900 --> 03:23:21.200
Brandy thank you for taking the extra time explaining the


4088
03:23:21.200 --> 03:23:24.300
questions Brandy. You are very welcome. That's all the questions I have


4089
03:23:24.300 --> 03:23:27.500
here. Unless anybody has any last lingering questions here.


4090
03:23:27.500 --> 03:23:30.200
You guys can feel free to


4091
03:23:30.200 --> 03:23:33.100
also leave a review on Google review. If you type in


4092
03:23:33.100 --> 03:23:36.400
Mystic Rebels on Google Maps, it'll pull us up if you guys enjoyed this


4093
03:23:36.400 --> 03:23:39.100
class and you want other people to know about it. It'll be


4094
03:23:39.100 --> 03:23:42.600
super helpful once it gets to our platform. But Google reviews do


4095
03:23:42.600 --> 03:23:44.800
help. I think people do actually look at them.


4096
03:23:45.400 --> 03:23:48.400
And everybody's left us a review. I tried to catch up. I'm very


4097
03:23:48.400 --> 03:23:51.400
appreciative of all of you guys. You guys don't understand what


4098
03:23:51.400 --> 03:23:54.200
it means Vibe tribe is one of our t-shirts that's gonna come out. You guys


4099
03:23:54.200 --> 03:23:57.500
are our Vibe tribe. You guys are Mystic Rebels,


4100
03:23:57.500 --> 03:24:00.600
you're Rebel Academy students. Now you guys are Mystic


4101
03:24:00.600 --> 03:24:03.100
Rebels Mystic Rebels was never meant to be


4102
03:24:03.100 --> 03:24:06.300
Ashley and I it was meant to be everybody anybody who


4103
03:24:06.300 --> 03:24:09.700
wanted to rebel against Pop Culture astrology or


4104
03:24:09.700 --> 03:24:12.500
the standard textbook stuff and wanted


4105
03:24:12.500 --> 03:24:15.400
to rebel against life and just kind of take things in their


4106
03:24:15.400 --> 03:24:18.900
own hands and do things on their own. That is the rebellious attitude.


4107
03:24:18.900 --> 03:24:21.100
We're looking for and obviously Mystic being in this


4108
03:24:21.100 --> 03:24:24.300
occult theme, that's what Mystic Rebels is


4109
03:24:24.300 --> 03:24:27.400
all about. It's all about learning and then taking this knowledge


4110
03:24:27.400 --> 03:24:30.100
applying it expanding and then if you


4111
03:24:30.100 --> 03:24:33.500
want teach other people not everybody's learning needs to


4112
03:24:33.500 --> 03:24:34.400
be a teacher but


4113
03:24:35.300 --> 03:24:38.700
you can do some amazing things and by the end of these seven classes,


4114
03:24:38.700 --> 03:24:40.000
I really think you're going to have


4115
03:24:41.100 --> 03:24:44.500
like just a much deeper understanding of


4116
03:24:44.500 --> 03:24:47.400
the fundamentals that make astrology work without having


4117
03:24:47.400 --> 03:24:50.600
to get into the nitty-gritty of all the math the biggest


4118
03:24:50.600 --> 03:24:53.800
I think I'm getting into the math is just saying hey 10 plus


4119
03:24:53.800 --> 03:24:56.900
2 or 10 plus 3, you


4120
03:24:56.900 --> 03:24:59.500
know, when I'm looking here this part of fortunate 10


4121
03:24:59.500 --> 03:25:00.800
degrees in this North Node it


4122
03:25:01.800 --> 03:25:04.500
Uh 13 degrees this right


4123
03:25:04.500 --> 03:25:07.300
here is you know,


4124
03:25:07.300 --> 03:25:10.300
three degrees away from each other. That's all you


4125
03:25:10.300 --> 03:25:13.900
really have to do. Is that kind of math there 25 you might


4126
03:25:13.900 --> 03:25:16.400
have something at 28 degrees something at 2 degrees just understand


4127
03:25:16.400 --> 03:25:17.500
that's four degrees away.


4128
03:25:18.900 --> 03:25:21.200
That's the extent of the math. I don't need you guys to learn all


4129
03:25:21.200 --> 03:25:21.800
the rest of it.


4130
03:25:24.100 --> 03:25:28.000
Urinatal chart looks like a diamond or Square Encompass. Thank


4131
03:25:27.100 --> 03:25:30.100
you for today. See you next to you next time Patrick. Thank you


4132
03:25:30.100 --> 03:25:34.000
for being a part of this Angie. So cool. We all


4133
03:25:33.400 --> 03:25:36.400
at the very first class ever. Go Vibe tribe.


4134
03:25:36.400 --> 03:25:39.300
Yes, go Vibe. Try my first class ever. I have


4135
03:25:39.300 --> 03:25:42.700
a feeling what I'm gonna be doing most is exploring expanding and


4136
03:25:42.700 --> 03:25:46.000
then teaching you guys my new theories because I've got


4137
03:25:45.200 --> 03:25:48.200
all these theories sitting up here that I really want


4138
03:25:48.200 --> 03:25:51.300
to test and they're not in textbooks and most people say


4139
03:25:51.300 --> 03:25:54.400
that they're not true and I'm just sitting there like no, I


4140
03:25:54.400 --> 03:25:57.300
think some of these might actually play out one that


4141
03:25:57.300 --> 03:25:58.000
I don't teach much


4142
03:25:59.100 --> 03:25:59.400
is


4143
03:26:01.100 --> 03:26:04.700
I've accurately predicted about 80% of


4144
03:26:04.700 --> 03:26:08.400
the time because I'm still figuring it out when


4145
03:26:07.400 --> 03:26:10.200
a woman's gonna go in labor and have


4146
03:26:10.200 --> 03:26:10.500
her child.


4147
03:26:11.200 --> 03:26:14.200
And that was exciting because if I can if I can get that


4148
03:26:14.200 --> 03:26:16.400
to a hundred percent and teach the world.


4149
03:26:17.300 --> 03:26:20.800
You know how many women that are pregnant will stop


4150
03:26:20.800 --> 03:26:23.400
worrying so much. They'll know what day


4151
03:26:23.400 --> 03:26:26.500
they're supposed to have the baby and if it's late if it's early if


4152
03:26:26.500 --> 03:26:29.300
it's whatever they know when it's gonna come out. So I'm working


4153
03:26:29.300 --> 03:26:32.700
on that. I haven't gotten it foolproof. But I've I predicted


4154
03:26:32.700 --> 03:26:35.500
our child. I knew the exact day. She was coming out my buddy as


4155
03:26:35.500 --> 03:26:35.500
well.


4156
03:26:36.500 --> 03:26:39.300
Few other people, so I got one or two off


4157
03:26:39.300 --> 03:26:41.200
one of them. I had three dates.


4158
03:26:42.600 --> 03:26:45.100
And honestly, I didn't think it was the first date and it ended up being the first


4159
03:26:45.100 --> 03:26:47.700
date. So I'm not 100% on it, but when I get that down.


4160
03:26:49.100 --> 03:26:50.100
I'm gonna get it down.


4161
03:26:52.800 --> 03:26:54.500
The degrees tell you the age you'll get married.


4162
03:26:55.800 --> 03:26:58.500
I'm still working on that. I got married.


4163
03:26:59.600 --> 03:27:02.300
This is a relocation chart. I got married at


4164
03:27:02.300 --> 03:27:03.000
24.


4165
03:27:04.700 --> 03:27:05.500
the first time


4166
03:27:09.800 --> 03:27:10.000
so


4167
03:27:11.900 --> 03:27:14.600
Nothing here. I mean Pluto and Libra,


4168
03:27:14.600 --> 03:27:15.200
but I also got


4169
03:27:18.600 --> 03:27:20.500
I mean, it's very transformational but this is


4170
03:27:22.400 --> 03:27:25.400
some other stuff that happened. I have a lot of stuff that happened at 24


4171
03:27:25.400 --> 03:27:25.900
and 25.


4172
03:27:26.900 --> 03:27:29.400
Which is why a lot of this is sitting the


4173
03:27:29.400 --> 03:27:29.900
way that it is.


4174
03:27:32.800 --> 03:27:33.900
I haven't figured that out yet.


4175
03:27:34.800 --> 03:27:37.100
And the biggest thing is I don't teach stuff that I


4176
03:27:37.100 --> 03:27:40.200
don't know works 100% So I have my theories and


4177
03:27:40.200 --> 03:27:42.900
sometimes I'll test things but until I know 100%


4178
03:27:44.100 --> 03:27:47.400
I won't I won't use it. I won't share it. But I those


4179
03:27:47.400 --> 03:27:50.600
are things trust me. I am working on then certain things. Like I said


4180
03:27:50.600 --> 03:27:53.600
that the moment where you're at a place where you're


4181
03:27:53.600 --> 03:27:56.100
ready to fall in love and be with


4182
03:27:56.100 --> 03:27:59.600
somebody that I call a marriage Transit and has nothing to do with marriage. I


4183
03:27:59.600 --> 03:28:02.300
have to rename it. I figure that out like that was a theory


4184
03:28:02.300 --> 03:28:05.300
that I tested and it worked a hundred percent of the time and now I use


4185
03:28:05.300 --> 03:28:05.800
it all the time.


4186
03:28:07.800 --> 03:28:10.300
Thank you for the class Lori in it's been a


4187
03:28:10.300 --> 03:28:15.200
great time. Thank you. Thank you 16 roses


4188
03:28:14.200 --> 03:28:17.300
on astro.com. Where do I go to change the


4189
03:28:17.300 --> 03:28:20.200
transit dates? I have today's date, but I want to do a


4190
03:28:20.200 --> 03:28:23.200
future date. So when you go back to your chart selection, it's


4191
03:28:23.200 --> 03:28:26.300
right here right under web web default Style just change


4192
03:28:26.300 --> 03:28:28.200
the state and then hit show the chart.


4193
03:28:29.700 --> 03:28:32.400
And then in the top right next to the green button, you'll


4194
03:28:32.400 --> 03:28:35.500
see a blue button that says transits and that'll


4195
03:28:35.500 --> 03:28:36.400
pull up the transits for you.


4196
03:28:38.800 --> 03:28:41.700
Alright, you guys have been amazing. Thank
