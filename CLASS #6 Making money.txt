00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:06.550
Welcome to the Mystic Rebels Rebel Academy.


2
00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.150
True astrology start making money class. This is true astrology.


3
00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.110
So whatever's going on in your chart,


4
00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.070
that's what we're using to be able to manifest the type of life that you want to


5
00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.190
live. True stands for transmuting real universal energies.


6
00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:22.710
This is a system I developed.


7
00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:26.870
So if you're jumping into this start making money class and you have not taken


8
00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:28.110
the masterclass,


9
00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.030
then you need to stop and go back and take that because if you continue on with


10
00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:33.950
this one and you haven't done that, you're going to be lost.


11
00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.710
I'm going to be talking about all the principles that I teach you in those five


12
00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:41.430
classes, and I will refer to them constantly.


13
00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:44.150
I will use them as though you already know what I'm talking about,


14
00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:45.390
so I'm not gonna break it down.


15
00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:47.870
Make sure you've taken that before you come here. Now,


16
00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.750
the reason I'm teaching this class is because while I'm teaching it,


17
00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:55.710
Jupiter and the north node are conjunct. They are in TAUs right now.


18
00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:59.790
Uranus is in TAUs. This is all about changing your mindset on value,


19
00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:03.630
changing how you look at things when it comes to money and finances.


20
00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:05.830
It's also about learning. It's also about teaching. Like,


21
00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:09.270
this is what I'm supposed to be doing right now and this is over my mid-heaven


22
00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:10.430
in TAUs in the 10th house.


23
00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:13.830
So I feel like this class is extremely important also,


24
00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:17.710
just because whether I'm doing tarot or astrology,


25
00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:21.750
it is the most common question that I get. How do I make my finances better?


26
00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:24.630
How do I build wealth? Um, am I doomed?


27
00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.470
Like I usually get the adverse side of this. Am I doomed?


28
00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:30.070
Am I not gonna make money? Why do I always lose money?


29
00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.990
The second house and Venus placement have to do with not money,


30
00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:38.070
not how much money you're gonna make, but your relationship with money.


31
00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:39.390
And a lot of people get this wrong.


32
00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.150
They think that the placement there is what it is. First off, uh,


33
00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:46.710
we know that the blueprint is there, but it is not a static set of energies.


34
00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:50.590
You can transmute energies. Otherwise, the true astrology system wouldn't work.


35
00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:54.150
We use it in our everyday life here at Mystic Rebels.


36
00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:57.990
So we know that you can take this energy, align with it,


37
00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:02.750
and do amazing things with your life, which are going to bring you value and um,


38
00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.710
also in increase your own sense of self-worth. And then of course,


39
00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:07.750
your finances and money.


40
00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:11.710
And there are a lot of things in the chart that signify money,


41
00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:15.590
although I consider this an intro class because we're only gonna be talking


42
00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:20.190
mainly about the Venus placement and the second house.


43
00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.910
Uh, there's gonna be a lot of information in this class,


44
00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:25.590
and I will be building upon this because money again,


45
00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.110
is one of the things that I get asked whether Tara or astrology,


46
00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.310
it's always about improving finances or going off on your own or making sure


47
00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.350
that you are set. Because in this material world, this is one of the things.


48
00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:39.830
It's one area of life that we need to be able to, uh,


49
00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:44.990
manifest the types of things that we want here. So I am going to go here to, uh,


50
00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:49.190
second slide. This is probably the most important thing to realize,


51
00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:52.990
is that although I'm gonna be focusing on Venus Tarus and the second house


52
00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.823
placements,


53
00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:58.790
that everything in your chart works together and you are not like anybody


54
00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:02.200
else. You have energies that are very specific to you.


55
00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:06.760
So when you hear people doing horoscopes or doing these social media videos,


56
00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:10.560
realize that's not you specifically,


57
00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:14.560
although there may be an overtone that could apply to you if you make it work.


58
00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.080
They do not have your chart in front of you.


59
00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:18.960
They don't know all your aspects of your rulerships, they don't know the trends.


60
00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:21.360
It's going to whatever planets that you have.


61
00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.800
They don't know the qu conks or the square or the rine.


62
00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:28.400
They know nothing like that in your chart. This is for you to develop the, um,


63
00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.200
the knowledge and the insight to be able to say, okay,


64
00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.560
these are the transit that's happening. This is what's in my natal chart.


65
00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:36.800
I'm only gonna be talking about the natal chart in this class.


66
00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:40.160
I'll be talking about transits in a separate class because it's just a lot of


67
00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:44.080
information and I wanna make sure that you get this down. Again,


68
00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:47.800
this is your relationship with money and your entire chart is a factor.


69
00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.720
We have your ascendant here, which is how you approach life in general,


70
00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:56.360
which means whether we're talking about love, career, children, uh,


71
00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:57.920
your friends, spirituality,


72
00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:01.440
it all comes back to the ascendant because that point right there is the hot


73
00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:03.800
wire of who you are in the first house of self.


74
00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:06.280
So that is always gonna be a factor,


75
00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:10.760
and you'll hear me touch on it every once in a while, uh, during this class.


76
00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:15.320
But that's always gonna be a factor in how you navigate this world.


77
00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:18.000
A couple of things that I'm not gonna be talking about in this class,


78
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.640
but are going to be very important for other classes include your progressions


79
00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:24.520
and your relocations. If you have moved,


80
00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:29.160
you have to factor in the new area and how if you were born there,


81
00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:33.760
that's the area, uh, the energy's influence of that area impacting you.


82
00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:36.600
And it does make changes to a lot of things. Namely,


83
00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:40.280
how you make money usually is greatly impacted because your mid-heaven is


84
00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:44.400
usually altered in some way in your progressions as we go through life.


85
00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:47.560
What you do when you're 20 to make money is not gonna be the same as


86
00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:51.720
30, 40, 50, 60, 70. It's always gonna change. It's always gonna be different.


87
00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:55.320
You are progressing, you are evolving. Different transits are happening.


88
00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:57.200
Different events in your life are gonna unfold.


89
00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:59.600
You need to make sure that you're not staying static.


90
00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:01.520
It's very good to understand your natal chart,


91
00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:03.560
but realize that as you progress and get older,


92
00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.960
a lot of these things are gonna add nuances and layers onto what you're doing.


93
00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:10.920
So you may start something, you might be successful for three years.


94
00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:12.000
You might hit a wall.


95
00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:15.560
That wall can be overcome if you understand the energies at play.


96
00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:17.800
But if you keep trying to do the same thing you've always been doing,


97
00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:21.920
you may be trying to work against a transit or some sort of aspect in your


98
00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:25.480
progressions, and that is the warning to say, Hey,


99
00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:27.880
you gotta make some changes in course, correct.


100
00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:32.040
So the ascendant has everything to do with your actions in this world,


101
00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:35.600
and that includes how you make money and why your second house.


102
00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:36.600
We've already talked about that.


103
00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:40.240
It is the relationship with money and how you align with value.


104
00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:43.160
It is your values and how you believe in your values.


105
00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:48.160
So it is not just money for like the static generalized term,


106
00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:52.720
but more how you and relations, yeah, you and money have this, uh,


107
00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:57.040
bond or lack thereof. The six house has to do with your work,


108
00:05:57.070 --> 00:05:58.820
work environment and your daily routine.


109
00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:01.400
The 10th house is your reputation and public image.


110
00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:05.560
We talk about this being your career house because it themes the type of work


111
00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:06.393
that we do.


112
00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:09.960
The sixth house and the 10th house do differ six houses where you have the


113
00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:10.793
authority,


114
00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:15.760
it's where you're seen in the present in in the workplace and how those


115
00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:19.000
themes apply. Whereas the sixth house has to do with the service,


116
00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:24.160
the type of job that you do in terms of services and the daily routine and


117
00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:26.720
the work environment. When you go there, what's around you?


118
00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:28.400
What type of environment are you in?


119
00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:33.800
The mid-heaven often aligned with the the, um, the 10th house, right?


120
00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:36.840
They're used synonymously, but they're not actually synonymous.


121
00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:39.920
Your 10th house does rule everything that Capricorn would rule,


122
00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:43.040
but the midheaven is a point that can actually float anywhere from the eighth to


123
00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:45.880
the 11th house. Oftentimes it's in the ninth or 11th.


124
00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:48.920
Eighth is actually very rare, but I've seen it and then often,


125
00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:50.160
I obviously see it in the 10th house.


126
00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:53.560
But this is really the opposition of your ic,


127
00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:57.320
the opposition of your nadier, the energy that you keep private.


128
00:06:57.340 --> 00:07:00.200
And it's everything that you don't keep private and you want to put out in the


129
00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:01.200
world. It's the trajectory,


130
00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:05.560
the opposition of what you seek and how you want to be seen.


131
00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:09.880
And this ends up being, um, we call it your life purpose again,


132
00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:14.520
cuz it opposes our private world, but it is a very personal angle point.


133
00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:16.040
It it is public,


134
00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:20.560
yet it's very personal to us just because it opposes the extremely personal ic.


135
00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:23.760
And then of course, Venus and your second house ruler. Remember,


136
00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:27.120
ruler ships are extremely important by directionality of ruler ships,


137
00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:29.640
if you have any planets. And the second house also very important.


138
00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:31.280
And then of course, aspects.


139
00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:35.680
This will all add additional information to color and theme everything to do


140
00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:39.960
with money. So it is a very complex th um, topic,


141
00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:42.240
but once you get into it, you'll start,


142
00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:44.600
you'll start seeing the themes and how they play out in your life,


143
00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:46.400
and then you can start aligning with them.


144
00:07:46.470 --> 00:07:49.880
Another thing that I don't talk about much in this is because, um,


145
00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:51.320
this is more on your personal level,


146
00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:56.120
is business finance is the eighth house and Scorpio and Pluto.


147
00:07:56.460 --> 00:08:01.200
So those are a, a different class for when I do the business class.


148
00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:04.200
This is more for your money, although if you have your own business,


149
00:08:04.230 --> 00:08:08.840
this still applies in addition to what the business, uh, revenue would be.


150
00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:11.120
Now we go on,


151
00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:15.080
I'm just just gonna go through each of your rising signs from Aries all the way


152
00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:15.780
to Pisces,


153
00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:19.000
and we're gonna just talk a little bit about your relationship and the ways to


154
00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:20.520
kind of use that energy and generate,


155
00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:23.400
I'm going to assume that there are no planets in any of these houses.


156
00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:28.120
I'm not gonna talk about the rulership right now, o other than what it is.


157
00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:33.000
I'm not gonna talk about where it is. And I'm going to also add in here, um,


158
00:08:33.430 --> 00:08:37.760
that it has to do with the placement of the ruler. So if you have,


159
00:08:38.540 --> 00:08:42.160
um, planets in the second house, so this is for Aries rising.


160
00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:46.040
Aries rising is here, the second house being Taurus is here.


161
00:08:46.350 --> 00:08:50.760
This is what we're looking at when we are looking for all of your money


162
00:08:50.790 --> 00:08:54.720
situation, your values, your relationship with money, uh, valuables,


163
00:08:54.990 --> 00:08:58.880
possessions and things of that nature. This also rules the earth, mother nature,


164
00:08:59.620 --> 00:09:03.160
uh, childbirth, womanhood. It's all the second house. But again,


165
00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:07.560
we are focusing through the lens of money and finances.


166
00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:12.040
So you'll see up here that the relationship with money for most Aries rising


167
00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:12.873
people, remember,


168
00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:15.920
I'm gonna go through all this and it is not gonna be a hundred percent


169
00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:19.000
applicable to every single person because this is very generic. However,


170
00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:20.720
it's a foundation to work off of.


171
00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:25.240
And each placement rulership and aspect is going to change this per person.


172
00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:29.080
But this is the basis assuming no planets not talking about the rulership.


173
00:09:29.860 --> 00:09:34.000
The relationship for most areas, risings, is that they enjoy comfortable things.


174
00:09:34.630 --> 00:09:38.560
They enjoy having things that are valuable. Value is extremely important.


175
00:09:38.660 --> 00:09:41.840
If they buy something, if they, um, spend money on something,


176
00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:45.000
they want the value out of it. And it needs to be,


177
00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:47.800
it needs to be equal to the amount that they're putting out.


178
00:09:48.230 --> 00:09:51.600
They don't mind spending money, but, and they will spend on luxury.


179
00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:55.520
But it's usually because they're in areas rising something that they want,


180
00:09:55.770 --> 00:09:59.920
right? Remember, the rising sign always colors the second house.


181
00:10:00.340 --> 00:10:03.200
And we'll talk about this. Like for instance, when I get to Leo,


182
00:10:03.340 --> 00:10:06.880
the reason why Leos are generous is because their second house of money is


183
00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:11.080
Virgo. It's service to others, right? So their money ends up being, uh,


184
00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:14.360
useful to help other people, but they come back to Aries.


185
00:10:14.420 --> 00:10:18.680
I'm getting ahead of myself. They like to spend on luxury, but money is money.


186
00:10:19.070 --> 00:10:23.000
This is kind of a compartmentalized thing for Aries rising in general.


187
00:10:23.110 --> 00:10:26.840
Work is work, communications, communication, home is home, blah, blah, blah.


188
00:10:27.180 --> 00:10:31.840
But money is money. They make money to make money. They see the value in money.


189
00:10:31.900 --> 00:10:36.320
But un until you get into the rulership, the actual, uh,


190
00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:40.440
topic of money doesn't really span around into the rest of their chart. It,


191
00:10:40.670 --> 00:10:42.720
they understand it for what it is.


192
00:10:42.740 --> 00:10:47.640
And that's a just a generalized natural Aries rising thing. Now,


193
00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:51.640
in order for them to generate money, they can do anything that involves food.


194
00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:56.440
They can u um, sell tangible physical items. They can, um,


195
00:10:56.540 --> 00:10:59.000
do anything that is art related to make money,


196
00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:01.840
and they can do anything that's directly related to finance.


197
00:11:01.910 --> 00:11:05.480
They could be bankers, they could be investors, they could be in investments,


198
00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:08.960
investment banking. Obviously, if you tie it all together, um,


199
00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:12.720
anything that they handle money depending on how other things are situated in


200
00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:14.520
their chart, they could even be into cryptocurrency,


201
00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:17.160
but it's all about the value of something.


202
00:11:17.870 --> 00:11:20.840
This could even be an somebody who's into like auctions and things like that.


203
00:11:20.860 --> 00:11:25.120
If they have certain placements that say, I want that value to be,


204
00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:27.680
I want to get more value than I put out, right?


205
00:11:27.820 --> 00:11:31.800
So if there's another Virgo placement or Mercury placement that's involved with


206
00:11:32.070 --> 00:11:34.640
TAUs, it could be somebody who does something like that,


207
00:11:34.740 --> 00:11:39.560
but value is value for them. Now, the money ruler is Venus. That's natural,


208
00:11:39.930 --> 00:11:44.080
right? Because TAUs rules money. So for an area's rising,


209
00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:46.280
they're looking to to TAUs. Anyway.


210
00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:50.640
I also wanna point out that anytime that you're looking at Venus and TAUs for


211
00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:53.840
money, you are always looking at Libra.


212
00:11:54.300 --> 00:11:56.760
And this is something that's often overlooked. People don't,


213
00:11:56.820 --> 00:11:58.760
do not look at their Libra house to understand.


214
00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:01.520
That is also a factor for making money. Now,


215
00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:04.320
I'm not gonna talk about Libra much throughout the entire thing.


216
00:12:04.380 --> 00:12:06.720
I'm making the statement now. So areas rising,


217
00:12:07.070 --> 00:12:10.600
also have to consider how their seventh house is situated,


218
00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:14.600
because they will also make money through others. They do it themselves,


219
00:12:14.620 --> 00:12:16.480
but they need somebody else to buy.


220
00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:22.120
So this is how they interact and this is how it works for their lib replacement


221
00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:25.480
to be involved. Aries rising needs that Libra to be involved.


222
00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:29.000
So there's often some aspect of either partnership, one-on-one dealings,


223
00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:33.040
dealing directly with the public, um, and, and public as a whole,


224
00:12:33.140 --> 00:12:36.560
not public as in like one-on-one, um, as a group,


225
00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:41.240
rather just it's the public as one. So this is extremely important. Remember,


226
00:12:41.410 --> 00:12:44.080
Libra is very important when you're talking about money as well,


227
00:12:44.460 --> 00:12:47.120
and it does tie into things that are pretty and all that kind of stuff.


228
00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:50.840
And you'll see that when we get to, um, Virgo and Libra rising.


229
00:12:51.940 --> 00:12:55.240
But, so this is Aries rising. Uh, and this also is,


230
00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:59.720
has to do with where Venus is, um, if Venus is in Taurus.


231
00:13:00.420 --> 00:13:04.040
So it's not just it's second house in Taurus or Venus in Taurus. All right,


232
00:13:05.090 --> 00:13:07.240
let's move on. Taurus rising. Well,


233
00:13:07.470 --> 00:13:12.120
TAUs rising is automatically about value anyway. Their second house is Gemini,


234
00:13:12.460 --> 00:13:16.280
but they themselves, they enjoy to be comfortable. They enjoy luxury,


235
00:13:16.430 --> 00:13:19.680
they enjoy the finer things. They enjoy, um,


236
00:13:21.950 --> 00:13:25.800
like, I think I already said it. Luxury, finer things, things that are handmade.


237
00:13:26.170 --> 00:13:29.840
These are very important to them. Uh, things that have value, things that have,


238
00:13:29.860 --> 00:13:34.240
uh, even a little bit of sentimentalism. The money ruler is Mercury though.


239
00:13:34.340 --> 00:13:38.760
So while you will look at Venus for every single, um, rising sign,


240
00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:41.680
you will al always look at the second House ruler. In this case,


241
00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:45.640
Gemini's ruler is Mercury. So you're gonna look to Mercury's placements.


242
00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:48.040
So now you're looking at Libra, you're looking at Mercury.


243
00:13:48.220 --> 00:13:52.040
And because Mercury is also co-led, you will also be looking at Virgo.


244
00:13:52.060 --> 00:13:55.400
So TAUs rising people, that's not Virgo. This is TAUs rising.


245
00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:58.720
People will also look at their Virgo or their, yeah, their Virgo placements,


246
00:13:59.500 --> 00:14:00.920
and you'll see how that ties in.


247
00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:06.040
A lot of TAUs Rising people do artistic services to other people that


248
00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:10.120
they use their hands. This is why a lot of ta people make things, right,


249
00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:12.040
because Gemini rules the hands.


250
00:14:12.220 --> 00:14:14.280
But let's get into the relationship with Money First.


251
00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:18.160
I know I'm a Gemini Mercury, I do things outta order. My,


252
00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:23.120
my Mercury is also opposite UUs and like trying Mar. So I do my best to stay on,


253
00:14:23.180 --> 00:14:26.040
on topic here. So if I tangent, I apologize,


254
00:14:26.190 --> 00:14:28.920
just rewind the video to figure out where I get back on track.


255
00:14:29.780 --> 00:14:31.040
So the relationship with money,


256
00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:34.040
because they have a Gemini in the second house for TA Rising,


257
00:14:34.460 --> 00:14:37.000
is that they always think they know how much money they have,


258
00:14:37.580 --> 00:14:40.360
but they don't typically know. It's always like this average.


259
00:14:40.510 --> 00:14:43.080
They think logically speaking, based off of everything that's happened,


260
00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:44.520
I think I know how much money I have,


261
00:14:44.540 --> 00:14:48.440
but they almost never know the exact amount. If they do know the exact amount,


262
00:14:48.820 --> 00:14:49.040
uh,


263
00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:52.760
it's because Mercury's in a very specific position and then they more are more


264
00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:54.960
factual. Like if they have the, uh,


265
00:14:55.180 --> 00:14:57.440
if they have Mercury in the third house for instance,


266
00:14:57.580 --> 00:15:00.280
or in the 10th house or something like that, they may always have like,


267
00:15:00.670 --> 00:15:03.960
knowledge of their or quick access to their online bank statements.


268
00:15:04.020 --> 00:15:05.880
So they have that total at hand,


269
00:15:05.900 --> 00:15:09.440
but they always think they know how much they're extremely impulsive for new


270
00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:12.680
things. Shiny objects, Ooh, that looks nice. I wanna buy something.


271
00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:15.280
I see that on tv, infomercials, all that kind of stuff.


272
00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:19.160
They're the first ones to jump on that. They tend to have two of everything.


273
00:15:19.670 --> 00:15:22.480
It's like, I get this, I see it, but you know,


274
00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:26.280
it came in blue and it came in purple, and I really liked both. It was like a,


275
00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:29.560
like a teal and this, and they justify it. They rationalize it,


276
00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:31.560
which is the other part of this. It's logical,


277
00:15:32.190 --> 00:15:35.720
even if they have to rationalize it. So it's not always logical to other people.


278
00:15:35.910 --> 00:15:40.720
It's logical to them. And this is kind of things and they like trinkets,


279
00:15:41.020 --> 00:15:41.800
uh, you know,


280
00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:44.400
little knickknacks and stuff like that that they could play with their hands as


281
00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:48.760
well and that fit in their hands. Now, this is the relationship with them,


282
00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:53.480
uh, with this. And, uh, when I'm talking about the relationship, uh, here, guys,


283
00:15:53.870 --> 00:15:56.040
sometimes it's how they accumulate money.


284
00:15:56.110 --> 00:15:58.800
Sometimes it's the reason why they feel like they don't have money,


285
00:15:59.060 --> 00:16:03.560
but either way, it's just how they interact, how they think, how they, um,


286
00:16:03.630 --> 00:16:06.400
it's not always to think that's more Gemini, but how they, um,


287
00:16:06.790 --> 00:16:11.640
associate with value and money. It's very cerebral, it's very hands-on.


288
00:16:11.710 --> 00:16:14.840
It's very like, do, do, do do, do, uh,


289
00:16:15.060 --> 00:16:16.880
for TA Rising when there's Gemini there,


290
00:16:17.380 --> 00:16:20.120
the ways to generate money are through communication.


291
00:16:20.230 --> 00:16:24.280
Some sort of communication, which could be writing, could be um,


292
00:16:25.050 --> 00:16:26.720
could be online, could be social media.


293
00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:30.080
Obviously the rulership is all going to be a part of this in Virgo placement.


294
00:16:30.390 --> 00:16:31.600
Working with their hands,


295
00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:34.920
like writing and coding and things of that nature where there's like hand eye


296
00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:38.240
coordination is one way to do that. Logistics,


297
00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:41.600
anything that deals with data numbers, you see a lot of accountants, uh,


298
00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:44.920
who are rising because remember, finance is very important already.


299
00:16:45.300 --> 00:16:48.360
And then the actual data is how they make their money through it.


300
00:16:48.700 --> 00:16:52.080
And then multiple streams of income. This is very common for TA Rising.


301
00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:56.880
Anybody who has, um, mercury or Gemini, either in the 10th, the sixth,


302
00:16:57.580 --> 00:17:01.240
uh, the second house, uh, or a midheaven there in Gemini.


303
00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:03.400
Multiple streams of income always.


304
00:17:03.580 --> 00:17:05.640
Or if they don't have more than one stream of income,


305
00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:08.120
they have a job that requires them to wear Multiple hats.


306
00:17:08.140 --> 00:17:10.400
Do at least two things. And to be honest,


307
00:17:10.540 --> 00:17:14.160
if a Gemini does not have somebody with Gemini, uh, uh,


308
00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:16.680
prominent tendencies does not have more than one thing to do,


309
00:17:16.910 --> 00:17:20.600
they tend to fizzle out, kind of hit their own roadblocks.


310
00:17:20.870 --> 00:17:23.560
Everybody else in the world will tell them, you know,


311
00:17:23.560 --> 00:17:25.600
you need to pick one thing, you need to focus on it.


312
00:17:25.860 --> 00:17:28.760
And that's actually their problem is that they only have one thing and they're


313
00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:29.680
focusing on the one thing,


314
00:17:29.780 --> 00:17:33.800
and they're losing their minds either out of boredom or it's just not aligning


315
00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:36.720
with their energies. The second side of Gemini is like, Hey, what do I do?


316
00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:41.560
So remember, Gemini energy is all about duality.


317
00:17:42.660 --> 00:17:47.320
So this is, uh, Gemini. So we're gonna go on to Gemini rising, Gemini rising.


318
00:17:47.380 --> 00:17:51.320
The second house is cancer is obviously ruled by the moon


319
00:17:54.030 --> 00:17:55.760
here. And, um,


320
00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.320
wherever the moon placement is and Venus placement,


321
00:17:59.740 --> 00:18:03.520
the relationship with money for Gemini Rising, having a cancer second house,


322
00:18:03.780 --> 00:18:08.600
is that they choose to use their money or not have their money based off of


323
00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:11.040
their mood and their emotion. I felt like buying this,


324
00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:13.360
I had a connection to this, I don't know why,


325
00:18:13.420 --> 00:18:14.840
but I really just want to get this.


326
00:18:15.230 --> 00:18:19.520
They also have their mood and their emotions fluctuate to the amount of money


327
00:18:19.550 --> 00:18:21.480
they feel they should have, right?


328
00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:23.840
Because we're talking about cancer energy in the moon,


329
00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:25.760
it's more about intuition and feeling. Now,


330
00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:29.880
they obviously can use their intuition as well to, uh,


331
00:18:29.910 --> 00:18:33.640
make good money decisions. If they have that blocked or closed off,


332
00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:34.840
they can have issues there.


333
00:18:35.550 --> 00:18:38.160
They don't like to tell people how much something costs.


334
00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:40.760
They don't like to tell how much it was. Um,


335
00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:43.480
especially anything that's in their home, it's very private to them.


336
00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:47.160
Their money is very private to them. This is my money. You know,


337
00:18:47.260 --> 00:18:49.480
you don't need to know. And that's just how it is.


338
00:18:50.250 --> 00:18:52.640
Money is definitely tied in with home of home and family.


339
00:18:52.850 --> 00:18:56.440
Often that's where the money goes. Either they're helping family with something,


340
00:18:56.830 --> 00:18:59.760
they are, you know, tying that money back into their own home.


341
00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:02.640
They're investing in homes or doing something like that that is,


342
00:19:02.830 --> 00:19:06.840
that is tied in with home and family. And money is more of a need. It,


343
00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:09.800
there's an emotional security that is tied with the need for money.


344
00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:12.200
And although cancer is,


345
00:19:12.890 --> 00:19:16.600
tends to be related to jobs that can produce a lot of money,


346
00:19:17.270 --> 00:19:19.280
it's more about this, the emotional security.


347
00:19:19.310 --> 00:19:22.320
It's not that cancer itself is a money sign.


348
00:19:22.670 --> 00:19:26.280
It's that it's the first one that has, again, that emotional connection to it.


349
00:19:26.460 --> 00:19:29.600
And depending on how your emotions are, are placed,


350
00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:33.640
meaning your moon placement in your chart will determine how important money is


351
00:19:33.700 --> 00:19:38.440
as a Gemini rising and good. For instance, my mother is a Gemini rising.


352
00:19:38.900 --> 00:19:41.600
She has cancer in the second house. Her moon is in Capricorn.


353
00:19:41.860 --> 00:19:44.920
So working that corporate job, making more money, having stability,


354
00:19:44.980 --> 00:19:46.040
that's all tied in.


355
00:19:46.040 --> 00:19:49.560
If she doesn't have that 401k and those investments in that portfolio and


356
00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:54.040
everything, and how have all that structure, it will affect her mood. It does,


357
00:19:54.180 --> 00:19:55.080
did, you know,


358
00:19:55.080 --> 00:20:00.000
affect her emotional status all based off of how much she did or didn't have,


359
00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:03.840
based off of what she felt she should have if the money went up and down as a


360
00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:05.600
Gemini, she's seen the number, she gets it,


361
00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:10.040
but if she felt like it should have been more, the mood will be affected by it.


362
00:20:10.180 --> 00:20:13.560
If she, and conversely, if it ends up being more than she thought,


363
00:20:14.020 --> 00:20:18.440
the mood is affected positively by that. Ways to generate, uh,


364
00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:19.600
I see this all the time.


365
00:20:19.660 --> 00:20:24.520
Cancer placements have unique opportunities to really


366
00:20:24.520 --> 00:20:29.320
connect with the public and their personal cancer's like a bridge between


367
00:20:29.580 --> 00:20:33.800
the, because of it's so intuitive between what is very private and what is very


368
00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:37.080
public. It is do obviously indirect opposition to Capricorn,


369
00:20:37.540 --> 00:20:41.240
but it just tends to be, um, the pulse of everything.


370
00:20:41.380 --> 00:20:45.760
So these cancer placements in your chart are a really good, uh,


371
00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:49.280
indication of where you connect well with the public because it is your


372
00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:50.113
intuition.


373
00:20:50.380 --> 00:20:54.200
But these people can make money doing real estate or domestic efforts.


374
00:20:54.600 --> 00:20:59.360
Domestic efforts means anything from like knitting to, uh, sewing, to cooking,


375
00:20:59.700 --> 00:21:04.280
to agriculture, farming. These are all, um, part of this, but real estate,


376
00:21:04.370 --> 00:21:06.440
which can be any facet of real estate,


377
00:21:06.680 --> 00:21:10.160
anything that has to do with physical homes would be a good place to make money.


378
00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:13.480
And obviously you would take the ruler and see where that is all aspects.


379
00:21:13.830 --> 00:21:16.440
Some people who have this are not going to be into real estate.


380
00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:19.400
Obviously this applies to everything I'm talking about because ruler ships,


381
00:21:19.710 --> 00:21:24.480
aspects, progressions, all those matter in relocations as well. Uh, nurturing,


382
00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:27.560
caring professions, anything like nursing, um,


383
00:21:27.710 --> 00:21:32.240
even things as like dental hygienist or um, babysitting,


384
00:21:32.520 --> 00:21:36.560
anything like that, uh, is very indicative of a, um,


385
00:21:37.300 --> 00:21:39.600
of a moon in the second house. Anything where they can,


386
00:21:39.990 --> 00:21:44.680
they tend to gravitate towards the Gemini. So there's some sort of logical, uh,


387
00:21:44.790 --> 00:21:49.720
component to this. Often if they are in some sort of, um, nurturing profession,


388
00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:52.920
there's some sort of logistics to it, um,


389
00:21:52.920 --> 00:21:57.280
where they're dealing with numbers or scheduling or anything like that. Uh,


390
00:21:57.280 --> 00:21:59.960
doing what feels good or at peace. This goes back to, uh,


391
00:21:59.960 --> 00:22:01.600
not only the intuition side,


392
00:22:01.660 --> 00:22:04.680
but the fact that it cancer naturally rules the fourth house.


393
00:22:04.680 --> 00:22:08.080
This is all about home family and things that are private. And then of course,


394
00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:10.840
through family, family businesses, working with family,


395
00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:13.320
creating something as a legacy for family,


396
00:22:13.700 --> 00:22:16.080
trying to set something up so that they can pass it down.


397
00:22:16.080 --> 00:22:17.720
This is all cancer type of energy,


398
00:22:18.140 --> 00:22:21.200
and that will take us to cancer rising.


399
00:22:21.750 --> 00:22:24.960
That means the second house is Leo, so the ruler is the sun.


400
00:22:25.100 --> 00:22:26.640
So anyone who's a cancer rising,


401
00:22:27.060 --> 00:22:30.160
you look to your sun placement to help you understand money. Now,


402
00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:34.800
this is like probably the closest sign, I think to take you into,


403
00:22:35.740 --> 00:22:39.960
um, take you into understanding,


404
00:22:40.580 --> 00:22:44.160
uh, kind of a pop culturey feel about sun science, right?


405
00:22:44.430 --> 00:22:47.400
Because all the other ones really have not much to do with it.


406
00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:50.760
The sun is vitality, happiness, you know, feeling like a kid,


407
00:22:50.790 --> 00:22:52.680
childhood risk and everything like that. Now,


408
00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:55.920
risk obviously can factor in if it is implemented.


409
00:22:56.380 --> 00:23:01.360
Cancer risings tend to make a lot of money because of risk. Leo rules risk,


410
00:23:02.220 --> 00:23:04.440
and I don't have that on here, but I wanted to mention it,


411
00:23:04.710 --> 00:23:08.440
that risk is associated, uh, with cancer rising due to Leo,


412
00:23:08.500 --> 00:23:10.560
and then the sun placement adds flavor to it.


413
00:23:10.940 --> 00:23:13.680
But their relationship with money is, they like things that are f uh,


414
00:23:13.680 --> 00:23:17.640
fancy and flashy. They like to have what's there and makes a statement.


415
00:23:17.990 --> 00:23:21.080
They like to spend money on entertainment. They might go out to see the game.


416
00:23:21.310 --> 00:23:23.560
They might, you know, go, you know, um,


417
00:23:23.780 --> 00:23:27.160
ice skating or something along those lines is anything that's fun,


418
00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:31.280
enjoyable recreation, they'll definitely put a lot into that. They may, uh,


419
00:23:31.340 --> 00:23:34.880
or they can make it that way as well. They may enjoy gambling.


420
00:23:35.260 --> 00:23:37.120
So cancer risings, you do have to be carefully.


421
00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:40.360
You don't sit there too long because risk is a thrill. It's, uh,


422
00:23:40.380 --> 00:23:43.480
and if you've made a lot of money doing it, it can be addictive, obviously.


423
00:23:44.140 --> 00:23:48.000
And there's, there's an attitude of money is going to be there when I need it.


424
00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:50.640
It's always like this because, because they're cancer risings,


425
00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:55.040
they're so intuitive, they feel like money is just gonna show up. Uh,


426
00:23:55.040 --> 00:23:58.400
and they know where to find it when they need it. And because it's the sun,


427
00:23:58.400 --> 00:24:01.000
it's like, boom, there it is. Um, you know,


428
00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:04.600
have they have the moon and then the sun rolling their first and second houses.


429
00:24:04.700 --> 00:24:07.120
So it's very intuitive and enlightening to them.


430
00:24:07.580 --> 00:24:12.240
So this is why cancers tend to be able to make a lot of money now. Um,


431
00:24:12.990 --> 00:24:14.880
everybody has the ability to,


432
00:24:14.980 --> 00:24:18.280
but you'll notice that a lot of people with cancer rising have been able to


433
00:24:18.280 --> 00:24:21.560
accumulate quite a bit of wealth because they identify with their sun sign.


434
00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:26.520
They let that kind of lead, uh, with their intuition. It's like this, this, uh,


435
00:24:27.340 --> 00:24:31.240
the vitality and the life meets the intuition and the things that they feel.


436
00:24:31.340 --> 00:24:31.900
So they,


437
00:24:31.900 --> 00:24:35.880
the people who know how to in integrate those and have positive aspects that,


438
00:24:35.980 --> 00:24:38.440
or even negative aspects that they've learned to embrace,


439
00:24:38.910 --> 00:24:43.840
they tend to be able to accumulate a lot of wealth using this ways to generate,


440
00:24:44.070 --> 00:24:46.240
obviously through entertainment and recreation.


441
00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:50.160
This is why you see a lot of cancer risings in entertainment, uh,


442
00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:54.840
especially stage performance or theater or film, creative pursuits,


443
00:24:55.440 --> 00:24:57.640
anything really that ha that allows for creativity.


444
00:24:57.640 --> 00:25:00.440
And this is not just because we're talking about the fifth house,


445
00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:03.800
and we're not talking about TAUs. We're not talking about, uh,


446
00:25:04.020 --> 00:25:06.080
Pisces and we're not talking about Libra.


447
00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:11.080
We're talking more about any way that they can express themselves in a way that


448
00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:15.840
is not logical, that is more creative. It's the other side of the brain here.


449
00:25:16.140 --> 00:25:19.880
If they can do that and do that their way and have fun with it and enjoy it,


450
00:25:20.060 --> 00:25:23.160
you will see that, that they will make a lot of money doing that as well.


451
00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:25.400
Creative pursuits are perfect for cancer.


452
00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:28.440
Risings doing what makes them happiest.


453
00:25:28.670 --> 00:25:32.160
It's because the sun rules the second house. It's all about creativity.


454
00:25:32.160 --> 00:25:35.680
Feeling like that kid and feeling like you're, you're, you have that life,


455
00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:40.360
that spark of life. So the happier you are, the more money you will make.


456
00:25:40.360 --> 00:25:43.360
This is kind of common through most of them, but for cancer risings,


457
00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:44.640
it really has to align.


458
00:25:44.940 --> 00:25:48.520
And then anything that has to do with a leadership role and doing something that


459
00:25:48.520 --> 00:25:50.200
they, again, they want to do,


460
00:25:50.460 --> 00:25:54.720
but they need to be able to have some sort of control over that and do things


461
00:25:54.720 --> 00:25:58.560
their way. They're not the type that enjoys having, um,


462
00:25:59.140 --> 00:26:02.720
for the most part and enjoys having a boss. So that's cancer rising.


463
00:26:04.860 --> 00:26:08.760
Leo Rising. So Leo second house is Virgo, so we know the money.


464
00:26:08.770 --> 00:26:13.000
Ruler is Mercury here, the relation, and then of course, because it's Mercury,


465
00:26:13.060 --> 00:26:16.360
you have to look at that up there in the 11th house of Gemini.


466
00:26:16.360 --> 00:26:19.040
So you're gonna see a lot of Leo Risings, um,


467
00:26:19.230 --> 00:26:22.160
make a lot of money by being in the spotlight. They're, they're known,


468
00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:26.160
they're online, they're, uh, influencers. They are obviously,


469
00:26:26.220 --> 00:26:28.320
and we've talked about the arts and anything like that.


470
00:26:28.380 --> 00:26:32.520
And that's less about the le well, Leo is,


471
00:26:32.520 --> 00:26:34.200
is the creative expression. It's that,


472
00:26:34.220 --> 00:26:38.040
but it's also the fact that their money house aligns with their 11th house, uh,


473
00:26:38.040 --> 00:26:38.800
society house.


474
00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:42.720
This is another reason why I see a lot of Leo risings all over the place in all


475
00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:47.120
kinds of artistic endeavors because it aligns with their 11th house and their


476
00:26:47.120 --> 00:26:51.040
second house. So you'll see these, uh, these guys, uh,


477
00:26:51.040 --> 00:26:53.800
we talked about the generosity a little bit before, uh,


478
00:26:53.800 --> 00:26:56.760
when I got ahead of myself in, in the Aries, uh, rising.


479
00:26:57.060 --> 00:27:01.320
And it's because Virgo is all about giving service to others.


480
00:27:01.320 --> 00:27:05.680
Helping others. Again, their 11th house is tied in, that's humanitarianism.


481
00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:10.080
So when you pull in the ruler Mercury into what a Leo rising chart is,


482
00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:11.560
this is why Leos are so generous,


483
00:27:11.660 --> 00:27:13.640
is because of the where the houses actually sit.


484
00:27:13.660 --> 00:27:18.480
Not because Leo itself is inherently generous, it's not, but Leo Rising is,


485
00:27:19.220 --> 00:27:23.080
you see sales shoppers, because Virgo is all about analyzing,


486
00:27:23.210 --> 00:27:26.160
being meticulous in the, in the house of value.


487
00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:27.560
They're constantly being critical.


488
00:27:27.900 --> 00:27:30.000
So they're always trying to figure out how much money they have,


489
00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:31.040
how much they can spend.


490
00:27:31.100 --> 00:27:35.520
And obviously there are plenty of Leo Risings like myself who don't keep any


491
00:27:35.520 --> 00:27:38.400
track of this kind of stuff. And that is because I have my,


492
00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:42.320
all that rulership in the sun. Uh, you know, my chart ruler,


493
00:27:42.370 --> 00:27:46.320
which is also important up here in Gemini, and it is opposite.


494
00:27:46.540 --> 00:27:50.920
The ruler here is opposite, uh, Neptune and my Mercury,


495
00:27:50.970 --> 00:27:55.920
which rules my second house, uh, Virgo, uh, yeah,


496
00:27:56.050 --> 00:27:59.960
money House is opposite Uranus. So it's like, eh,


497
00:28:00.120 --> 00:28:02.320
I don't really care that much how much money I have.


498
00:28:02.360 --> 00:28:05.440
I always know I can make it, but that's because of other things in my placement.


499
00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:08.800
If you strip away all my chart signs as a Leo Rising, which I am,


500
00:28:09.630 --> 00:28:13.400
then it is about this and they're kind of like, um,


501
00:28:14.300 --> 00:28:17.960
ta risings in that they feel like they always know how much money they have.


502
00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:19.960
Again, it's because Mercury is the ruler,


503
00:28:20.100 --> 00:28:24.480
so they have a good beat on how much they have. Um, I actually use this, uh,


504
00:28:24.910 --> 00:28:27.320
it's also about strategy and detail and planning, right?


505
00:28:27.520 --> 00:28:30.280
I don't necessarily plan my money, but I do do something that's interesting.


506
00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:32.560
I said Doo do. Um,


507
00:28:33.040 --> 00:28:37.760
I actually use this Virgo here by, I take, um,


508
00:28:37.940 --> 00:28:42.720
if I have an expense, if I'm paying out, I always round it up. So I, in my mind,


509
00:28:42.780 --> 00:28:45.960
in my bank account, I've paid more. If I have money coming in,


510
00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:49.000
I always round it down. So I always feel like I'm receiving less money.


511
00:28:49.220 --> 00:28:52.280
And it always keeps me having more money than I think I have,


512
00:28:52.520 --> 00:28:53.800
which obviously keeps me happy.


513
00:28:54.180 --> 00:28:58.480
But that's something that's actually this Virgo placement that I use there. Um,


514
00:28:59.220 --> 00:29:00.640
and Virgo, uh, I'm sorry,


515
00:29:00.660 --> 00:29:03.760
Leo Rising because Virgos in the second house always feels like they have to


516
00:29:03.790 --> 00:29:07.000
work for their money. Now with it, mercury being ruled there,


517
00:29:07.060 --> 00:29:10.480
it also means that stress, and this goes with Tars rising as well,


518
00:29:10.520 --> 00:29:13.880
I guess stress around finances is heavy,


519
00:29:14.700 --> 00:29:17.600
and maybe even more so for Tace Rising, if I'm completely honest.


520
00:29:17.660 --> 00:29:20.960
But Leo Rising as well, stresses around money.


521
00:29:21.390 --> 00:29:26.280
This is the biggest stressor for TACE and Leo Rising, is money, finances,


522
00:29:26.280 --> 00:29:30.040
because they always feel like they need to work, you know, hard for it,


523
00:29:30.280 --> 00:29:32.960
and they need to do what they do. Leo feels like they need to work hard.


524
00:29:33.220 --> 00:29:36.920
Taurus feels like they need to just know how to make money.


525
00:29:37.020 --> 00:29:38.960
And when they don't just know how to make money,


526
00:29:38.980 --> 00:29:42.200
it really bothers them and stresses them out. Whereas Leo Rising, it's like,


527
00:29:42.240 --> 00:29:43.880
I gotta work hard. I know I gotta work hard.


528
00:29:44.270 --> 00:29:46.800
Obviously if you're Leo Rising and you don't like to work hard,


529
00:29:46.800 --> 00:29:49.120
you have to look at the rest of the planets. But this is, again,


530
00:29:49.380 --> 00:29:53.840
the basis to wait to generate money for Leo Rising Services


531
00:29:54.380 --> 00:29:57.800
is literally what it is. Work services, those are the main things.


532
00:29:57.800 --> 00:30:01.440
Finding routine, finding things that work on their own. Now,


533
00:30:01.510 --> 00:30:06.400
this is automation as well for Leo Risings because Mercury ruled Gemini


534
00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:09.960
is in the 11th house. So it brings in technology, it brings in networks, groups,


535
00:30:10.010 --> 00:30:11.920
teams brings in automation.


536
00:30:12.220 --> 00:30:15.760
So there are actually two different ways for both TAUs and,


537
00:30:17.260 --> 00:30:22.000
um, uh, TAUs and Leo Rising.


538
00:30:22.090 --> 00:30:26.040
Sorry, I'm staring right at it. Leo Risings two, make money here.


539
00:30:26.100 --> 00:30:29.960
And that is through the second end. The, uh, 11th houses here.


540
00:30:30.020 --> 00:30:32.480
So this is more like, um, groups,


541
00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:35.800
multiple groups and multiple teams and, uh,


542
00:30:35.820 --> 00:30:40.000
all of that and the actual workings of


543
00:30:40.210 --> 00:30:43.520
automation and the Virgo is all about the services.


544
00:30:43.520 --> 00:30:46.360
It's all about creating a strategy. And also, of course,


545
00:30:46.420 --> 00:30:49.720
health services and medical management, because Leo's the ruler.


546
00:30:49.720 --> 00:30:50.640
If you have Virgo here,


547
00:30:50.980 --> 00:30:55.720
if you are in medicine or any type of healthcare or any type of service


548
00:30:55.720 --> 00:30:58.480
related industry, you may start there,


549
00:30:58.540 --> 00:31:02.200
but your goal is to work your way up to the top. Um,


550
00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:04.760
because your value is with Taurus in the 10th house.


551
00:31:04.760 --> 00:31:07.600
Your value is in the management, again,


552
00:31:08.470 --> 00:31:12.880
without any planets or anything like that. Virgo rising, um,


553
00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:17.200
just like Aries Rising has a Venus ruled second house. So, uh,


554
00:31:17.480 --> 00:31:21.680
Aries in Virgo are both going to have Venus to look to,


555
00:31:22.460 --> 00:31:27.240
to be fair. Every single, um, uh,


556
00:31:27.370 --> 00:31:30.120
every single planet, every single, oh my God,


557
00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:34.080
I can't think every single sign has, uh, Venus to look to,


558
00:31:34.080 --> 00:31:37.520
because Venus also rules this. But in terms of the houses,


559
00:31:38.100 --> 00:31:39.920
you're going to look at TAUs here.


560
00:31:39.940 --> 00:31:42.120
So a Virgo rising's gonna look to their ninth house.


561
00:31:42.420 --> 00:31:46.600
So things that they're educated on, higher education, college culture, travel,


562
00:31:46.600 --> 00:31:49.360
things of that nature that they put value in and how they make money and


563
00:31:49.360 --> 00:31:50.193
international money.


564
00:31:50.360 --> 00:31:54.720
Virgo Rising can make money through international endeavors pretty easily if


565
00:31:54.720 --> 00:31:57.200
they're set up for it. And obviously you look to see where Venus is,


566
00:31:57.260 --> 00:32:01.520
and if it's positively aspected, that would be how it is Libra rising. Now,


567
00:32:01.520 --> 00:32:05.520
this is the key is that because Libra is in the second house of Virgo rising,


568
00:32:05.690 --> 00:32:08.640
often the partner actually makes the money. The Virgo doesn't,


569
00:32:08.640 --> 00:32:09.960
they end up doing services,


570
00:32:09.960 --> 00:32:12.760
but their partner tends to make more money or they make the same as their


571
00:32:12.760 --> 00:32:16.200
partner. It tends to fluctuate, but they tend to be able to skate by,


572
00:32:16.220 --> 00:32:18.360
if they're in a lower class, if they're in the middle class,


573
00:32:18.360 --> 00:32:20.880
they kind of stay like this upper class like this.


574
00:32:21.810 --> 00:32:26.560
Being able to align themselves with people. Um, of course, I'm,


575
00:32:26.740 --> 00:32:30.280
I'm stepping ahead, but align themselves with people is how they change this.


576
00:32:30.710 --> 00:32:35.600
They love pretty things. They love fashion. Um, they tend to enjoy, uh,


577
00:32:35.600 --> 00:32:38.000
which is interesting because Virgo is very particular,


578
00:32:38.260 --> 00:32:42.560
but the Libra and the second house is, would be, um, very,


579
00:32:42.830 --> 00:32:43.660
they would,


580
00:32:43.660 --> 00:32:47.520
they'd be very attracted to things that have a little bit of flair to them,


581
00:32:47.640 --> 00:32:50.120
a little bit of elegance to them for sure.


582
00:32:51.020 --> 00:32:53.400
And they can spend double by paying for others.


583
00:32:53.400 --> 00:32:55.680
That's the thing for a Virgo Rising service to others,


584
00:32:55.680 --> 00:32:58.640
you're constantly working for other people, constantly helping other people.


585
00:32:58.940 --> 00:33:01.720
It also shows in your finances where you're like, I'll get you that drink.


586
00:33:01.910 --> 00:33:05.120
I'll pay for this. You wanna get some appetizer, I'll do it. I'll take,


587
00:33:05.300 --> 00:33:08.360
and then you end up with less money because you end up paying for more people.


588
00:33:08.470 --> 00:33:10.840
Even like, it's not, you didn't need to,


589
00:33:10.980 --> 00:33:14.800
but you feel like you're obligated because you enjoy being of service to other


590
00:33:14.800 --> 00:33:19.320
people. Now, the ways to generate more money here, fashion and beauty,


591
00:33:19.370 --> 00:33:22.360
those are the first ones. Fashion, beauty, and design.


592
00:33:22.680 --> 00:33:25.560
Anything that is design related, uh, will be here.


593
00:33:25.560 --> 00:33:28.520
Especially anything where you have to do like the details or anything like this.


594
00:33:28.560 --> 00:33:32.360
I see a lot of, uh, Virgos that are, um,


595
00:33:33.420 --> 00:33:33.720
you know,


596
00:33:33.720 --> 00:33:37.520
I see a lot of Virgo rising that end up being executives because they end up


597
00:33:37.520 --> 00:33:40.200
doing mediation as the way that they make money.


598
00:33:40.200 --> 00:33:41.840
They're like the middle person to somebody.


599
00:33:41.840 --> 00:33:45.840
That's really what a secretary is in a lot of these places is they end up doing


600
00:33:45.840 --> 00:33:49.040
the Gemini work up here where they're doing all the communication,


601
00:33:49.040 --> 00:33:51.400
answering the emails, doing all that, all the stuff on the phone,


602
00:33:51.740 --> 00:33:53.400
and then they're mediating.


603
00:33:53.540 --> 00:33:56.640
So this between themselves or the customer and the ceo,


604
00:33:56.820 --> 00:33:59.440
the person who wants to get ahold of the person that they're working for,


605
00:33:59.630 --> 00:34:02.680
they end up being mediator. And that's another way that this tends to play out.


606
00:34:02.680 --> 00:34:05.920
That's not listed on here, but, um,


607
00:34:06.350 --> 00:34:09.640
fashion and beauty is definitely one through partnership.


608
00:34:09.750 --> 00:34:12.200
Partnership is amazing for Virgos,


609
00:34:12.420 --> 00:34:16.320
and a lot of Virgos feel because they feel like they need to be of service to


610
00:34:16.320 --> 00:34:19.160
others, that they don't end up getting this equality thing.


611
00:34:19.160 --> 00:34:23.200
And that's kind of a thing with Libra that some people don't realize that Libras


612
00:34:23.200 --> 00:34:26.280
about balance and fairness, but never is.


613
00:34:26.780 --> 00:34:30.520
And that's the unfortunate thing is that it, it, it should be,


614
00:34:30.740 --> 00:34:34.040
and they strive towards it, but it's very difficult to attain. However,


615
00:34:34.830 --> 00:34:39.240
they need to find and strike balance with other people to be able to utilize


616
00:34:39.380 --> 00:34:40.720
assets, um,


617
00:34:40.820 --> 00:34:44.720
and kind of pull all that together so that they can find their fairness and


618
00:34:44.720 --> 00:34:47.400
their level of money that comes through partnership, but,


619
00:34:47.540 --> 00:34:51.880
but gives them a comfortable lifestyle because they also want that with a Venus


620
00:34:51.970 --> 00:34:55.200
ruled second house. They also want comfort. They want to be comfortable,


621
00:34:55.200 --> 00:34:57.440
they want to have what they want. They wanna make sure that they're not,


622
00:34:57.590 --> 00:34:58.800
that they feel balanced.


623
00:34:59.080 --> 00:35:03.200
A lot of Virgo Risings actually feel comfortable when they're not rich. Uh,


624
00:35:03.340 --> 00:35:06.320
you know, obviously the planetary placements will all change this,


625
00:35:06.380 --> 00:35:09.640
but they like to just be level.


626
00:35:09.640 --> 00:35:11.440
That's what they're seeking is balance and harmony.


627
00:35:12.450 --> 00:35:16.880
Legal work is huge for Virgo Risings. I also see them in law firms and whatnot.


628
00:35:17.090 --> 00:35:20.920
Being able to step it up and be the service to the client rather than service to


629
00:35:20.920 --> 00:35:25.440
the firm. That's the key for a lot of them. Not everybody wants to do that.


630
00:35:25.470 --> 00:35:26.880
Some people like they're nine to five.


631
00:35:26.880 --> 00:35:29.000
Some people wanna stay at that certain role,


632
00:35:29.060 --> 00:35:33.120
but a lot of these Virgo risings do, um, especially because in,


633
00:35:33.180 --> 00:35:35.000
in a lot of the charts that I do,


634
00:35:35.100 --> 00:35:39.480
the timeframe tends to be a Chiron and TAUs thing where they don't value,


635
00:35:39.900 --> 00:35:42.280
you know, their contributions, their self.


636
00:35:42.280 --> 00:35:45.520
They have lower self-worth insecurities with money and things like that.


637
00:35:45.700 --> 00:35:50.000
So a lot of these Virgo Rising should be taking the step and elevating


638
00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:54.720
themselves a bit. And they're so good at multi-tasking and, uh,


639
00:35:54.720 --> 00:35:59.240
being able to balance all of that out if they're able to create a career with


640
00:35:59.240 --> 00:36:00.880
this Gemini energy in the 10th house,


641
00:36:01.140 --> 00:36:03.400
so that they are multitasking and doing different things,


642
00:36:03.400 --> 00:36:04.800
whether that's in one job or,


643
00:36:04.860 --> 00:36:07.880
or juggling a couple of businesses that maybe they have,


644
00:36:08.140 --> 00:36:10.840
and they tend not to start their own businesses with this Pisces in Seventh


645
00:36:10.840 --> 00:36:14.200
House. If they do, it's usually something that inspires creativity.


646
00:36:14.420 --> 00:36:16.880
So you end up seeing Virgo Risings being like organizers,


647
00:36:16.880 --> 00:36:18.040
professional organizers,


648
00:36:18.040 --> 00:36:22.000
something like that where they get to be creative and it's not really a job that


649
00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:26.520
has much structure. Obviously that can change if like Neptunes in, um,


650
00:36:26.790 --> 00:36:29.040
Capricorn or if you have certain other placements,


651
00:36:29.140 --> 00:36:32.960
but that tends to be kind of it. A lot of Virgo risings that get into music,


652
00:36:33.060 --> 00:36:35.640
if they start their own business, they kind of do their own thing where they're,


653
00:36:35.900 --> 00:36:39.920
um, either musicians or, uh, with that 10th house in Gemini, uh,


654
00:36:40.060 --> 00:36:41.520
do like the technical side of it,


655
00:36:41.520 --> 00:36:43.600
where they're producing or something along those lines.


656
00:36:44.580 --> 00:36:49.240
But legal work is huge because labor rules, legal stuff. And like I said before,


657
00:36:49.240 --> 00:36:52.200
finding stability, finding that balance, uh,


658
00:36:52.230 --> 00:36:54.760
with what you put out versus what you get back.


659
00:36:54.820 --> 00:36:58.200
And that is the main key for Virgo Risings when it comes to money,


660
00:36:58.220 --> 00:37:00.400
is making sure that you are not doing, doing, doing,


661
00:37:00.770 --> 00:37:03.760
being of service all the time and not being compensated for it.


662
00:37:03.760 --> 00:37:07.160
Making sure you find that stability. Make sure you are receiving the money.


663
00:37:07.180 --> 00:37:10.680
If you couple this with a Chiron and TAUs, it makes it very difficult.


664
00:37:10.900 --> 00:37:14.440
You're gonna have to work on both your Chiron Taurus and your Libra in the


665
00:37:14.440 --> 00:37:18.160
second house to rectify this and remedy this Libra rising.


666
00:37:19.100 --> 00:37:21.280
So that means the second house is in Scorpio.


667
00:37:21.540 --> 00:37:24.480
The money ruler is wherever Pluto sits in the chart,


668
00:37:24.480 --> 00:37:26.240
which will add context to all of this.


669
00:37:26.540 --> 00:37:29.280
The relationship is that money disappears.


670
00:37:29.280 --> 00:37:32.760
I hear a lot of people with Pluto in the second house, or you know,


671
00:37:32.910 --> 00:37:36.520
Scorpio as a second house ruler because they're labor risings.


672
00:37:36.520 --> 00:37:38.800
That's like money, just, there's,


673
00:37:38.910 --> 00:37:42.640
there's always a reason why I can't hold onto it. Uh,


674
00:37:43.660 --> 00:37:47.240
or they end up here. It is usually easily in debt.


675
00:37:47.580 --> 00:37:50.880
So they have a really hard time not going after the lavish things,


676
00:37:51.220 --> 00:37:52.053
not going after.


677
00:37:52.150 --> 00:37:56.560
They can obsess over luxury with that TAUs in the eighth house here


678
00:37:57.340 --> 00:38:01.480
and, uh, end up getting themselves quite in debt. They,


679
00:38:01.700 --> 00:38:05.720
the money tends to come from other people. A lot of liber rising charts,


680
00:38:05.720 --> 00:38:09.760
it's always, they end up partnering, uh, because that's natural for Libra.


681
00:38:09.760 --> 00:38:12.800
They find themselves through partnerships and they end up partnering and their


682
00:38:12.800 --> 00:38:17.320
money comes through, shared resources mostly from their partner, uh,


683
00:38:17.320 --> 00:38:20.800
unsure how to make money on their own, is a side effect of that. They,


684
00:38:20.870 --> 00:38:23.800
they tend to like Pluto, it's hidden, it's mysterious.


685
00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:26.440
They're not really sure where it comes from or how to get it.


686
00:38:26.440 --> 00:38:31.080
It just feels unattainable. And this is, this is a hard one for Libra Rising,


687
00:38:31.200 --> 00:38:35.480
I think because Pluto in its in and of itself is a difficult placement,


688
00:38:35.600 --> 00:38:39.480
a difficult planet to harbor because it is chaos in mayhem,


689
00:38:39.480 --> 00:38:42.120
in the ruler of the underworld and things that go awry and all that.


690
00:38:42.900 --> 00:38:45.520
And it does involve other people. And, uh,


691
00:38:45.650 --> 00:38:49.320
Libra should be really aware that the other people are significant in there.


692
00:38:49.320 --> 00:38:51.720
They, they have this feeling like they're all,


693
00:38:51.720 --> 00:38:53.960
they're so used to partnership and dealing with other people,


694
00:38:53.960 --> 00:38:55.280
but they wanna make their own money.


695
00:38:55.580 --> 00:38:57.760
And it's ironic that because Scorpio's there,


696
00:38:57.760 --> 00:38:59.840
that money actually has to come from other people as well.


697
00:38:59.990 --> 00:39:01.400
It's just a matter of how you do that.


698
00:39:01.420 --> 00:39:04.400
You can still make your own money by using other people's resources,


699
00:39:04.630 --> 00:39:09.360
insurance and debt, huge ones. People who do like life insurance and um,


700
00:39:09.380 --> 00:39:11.840
all kinds of insurance policies. Um,


701
00:39:11.840 --> 00:39:16.440
labor Risings can do a really good job with this because they understand the


702
00:39:16.440 --> 00:39:18.840
investment strategy if they learn it obviously,


703
00:39:19.740 --> 00:39:22.640
and it aligns their energies with being able to, um,


704
00:39:24.820 --> 00:39:28.520
to accumulate this through shared possessions. Also, wealth management.


705
00:39:29.280 --> 00:39:33.280
I hardly ever see Libra Risings in wealth management, yet they should be.


706
00:39:33.460 --> 00:39:35.920
You literally have cancer in your 10th house,


707
00:39:35.920 --> 00:39:39.640
which has to do with families and home and the authority there.


708
00:39:39.860 --> 00:39:44.520
You have your TAUs, which is your money house in, uh, other people's money.


709
00:39:44.940 --> 00:39:48.360
You have Libra, which is you being able to associate with other people.


710
00:39:48.820 --> 00:39:51.920
You have Mars, which is you doing something for someone else,


711
00:39:52.670 --> 00:39:57.480
like finding yourself within them. It's like it all aligns in. Um,


712
00:39:57.480 --> 00:40:00.080
but I don't see it as much. It's something that some people could,


713
00:40:00.080 --> 00:40:01.600
should consider if you're,


714
00:40:01.600 --> 00:40:03.280
especially if you're looking to start your own business,


715
00:40:03.300 --> 00:40:04.560
if you have a Mars placement,


716
00:40:04.560 --> 00:40:06.320
because the seventh house is about starting your own business.


717
00:40:06.320 --> 00:40:08.440
If you have a Mars placement that supports it,


718
00:40:09.020 --> 00:40:10.600
you could be that type of person that doesn't,


719
00:40:10.600 --> 00:40:13.680
especially if you're already doing insurance and things and debt and stuff like


720
00:40:13.680 --> 00:40:13.820
that.


721
00:40:13.820 --> 00:40:17.480
You could start your own family office and be a wealth manager and you know how


722
00:40:17.480 --> 00:40:21.440
much they make. Uh,


723
00:40:22.380 --> 00:40:24.200
so they have that through businesses.


724
00:40:24.370 --> 00:40:28.600
Libra Risings should be starting their own business, most Libra Risings, uh,


725
00:40:28.600 --> 00:40:31.400
because Aries, again, it depends on how your Mars is placed,


726
00:40:31.400 --> 00:40:34.120
but because areas in the seventh house, this is entrepreneurship,


727
00:40:34.140 --> 00:40:36.960
energy going off on your own and doing your own thing,


728
00:40:36.960 --> 00:40:40.320
being able to work from home is something that a li rising would most Libra


729
00:40:40.440 --> 00:40:41.400
risings love anyway.


730
00:40:42.060 --> 00:40:45.720
And being able to start that business finance is the eighth house.


731
00:40:45.800 --> 00:40:47.440
I mentioned that earlier in the class here.


732
00:40:47.440 --> 00:40:51.200
So you already are set up for that so that you would make money through that.


733
00:40:52.220 --> 00:40:54.400
Uh, bringing people together to pull resources,


734
00:40:54.670 --> 00:40:58.560
kind of summarizing what I've already said here and diving deeper into their


735
00:40:58.560 --> 00:41:01.640
chosen field. The more you, you dive and,


736
00:41:01.660 --> 00:41:06.080
and place value and pull value from something that you're doing as a libra


737
00:41:06.200 --> 00:41:09.480
rising, the more that you are going to be able to make money from it,


738
00:41:09.480 --> 00:41:13.120
because you'll be able to share deeper and dive deeper that other people can't


739
00:41:13.120 --> 00:41:15.240
do. So a Libra rising's best option,


740
00:41:15.630 --> 00:41:20.280
most Libra rising is to dive deeper and be able to do more in their chosen field


741
00:41:20.280 --> 00:41:24.680
than anybody else. It makes them stand out. It makes them a household figure,


742
00:41:25.080 --> 00:41:25.840
a household name,


743
00:41:25.840 --> 00:41:29.400
because they are able to accomplish things that other people in their field are


744
00:41:29.400 --> 00:41:30.400
not able to accomplish,


745
00:41:30.400 --> 00:41:33.240
and this is where they find your uniqueness and their individuality.


746
00:41:34.980 --> 00:41:39.440
If we move on to Scorpio rising, our second house is in Sagittarius.


747
00:41:39.710 --> 00:41:42.880
Sagittarius is ruled by Jupiter. So take a look at your Jupiter placement.


748
00:41:43.240 --> 00:41:47.920
A lot of people who are Scorpio risings get lucky unless they have a Jupiter


749
00:41:47.920 --> 00:41:50.680
retrograde or a adversely aspected Jupiter.


750
00:41:50.910 --> 00:41:54.720
They tend to find luck and make and, and come across opportunities.


751
00:41:54.910 --> 00:41:57.920
Whether they take them or not is a completely different thing.


752
00:41:57.940 --> 00:42:01.760
But Scorpio rising is set up for business, international business.


753
00:42:03.180 --> 00:42:06.840
So especially if there's a headquarters or, you know, it's, it's a,


754
00:42:07.200 --> 00:42:11.440
a longstanding, uh, um, company, right?


755
00:42:12.660 --> 00:42:16.680
So because, uh, Sagittarius is here,


756
00:42:17.860 --> 00:42:19.480
um, and we're looking at Jupiter,


757
00:42:19.480 --> 00:42:24.360
then we have the relationship with money is high highs and lows, low lows.


758
00:42:24.360 --> 00:42:27.680
That's because Jupiter expands. If you are having a bad streak,


759
00:42:27.710 --> 00:42:31.200
Jupiter will expand your bad streak and make it worse. Obviously,


760
00:42:31.200 --> 00:42:35.040
if you're conversely on a high streak, then you will have a high, high.


761
00:42:35.900 --> 00:42:40.640
So Jupiter, although seen often as the male or the, I'm sorry, the benefic,


762
00:42:40.940 --> 00:42:45.760
the great lucky, you know, abundant planet, that it is, uh,


763
00:42:45.760 --> 00:42:48.720
there is a downside. It's also the, the,


764
00:42:48.850 --> 00:42:52.920
especially in the first house or related to your health houses, um,


765
00:42:53.220 --> 00:42:55.120
is the planet that can make you gain a lot of weight.


766
00:42:55.190 --> 00:42:57.480
Jupiter transits to the first house can do the same thing.


767
00:42:57.580 --> 00:43:00.360
So remember that Jupiter just expands a lot.


768
00:43:00.360 --> 00:43:04.360
Oftentimes when something's going well and ju comes along, then that's great.


769
00:43:04.620 --> 00:43:08.520
If something's going bad, Jupiter comes along and makes it exponentially worse.


770
00:43:09.780 --> 00:43:10.760
Uh, you tend to have,


771
00:43:11.140 --> 00:43:14.000
as a Scorpio rising your own philosophy about money in life.


772
00:43:14.060 --> 00:43:17.920
You think you can dive as a Scorpio rising. You have, uh,


773
00:43:18.820 --> 00:43:22.360
is it dove dived d whatever, deeper, uh, into it.


774
00:43:22.360 --> 00:43:24.920
And you have come up with your own philosophies. Some of the,


775
00:43:24.920 --> 00:43:29.600
some Scorpio risings have kind of separated themselves from the material world,


776
00:43:29.600 --> 00:43:33.080
and they believe money is just a construct and you don't need money.


777
00:43:33.220 --> 00:43:37.160
And this is why, uh, other people have, you know,


778
00:43:37.160 --> 00:43:40.680
developed their own system around how they believe money works.


779
00:43:41.430 --> 00:43:46.160
It's very interesting, but this can lead to a lot of money or no money.


780
00:43:46.820 --> 00:43:51.120
And whether or not you're happy with that or not, opportunity will show itself.


781
00:43:51.120 --> 00:43:52.600
Often. I kind of said this earlier,


782
00:43:52.780 --> 00:43:57.080
and then they tend to spend money on experience. They value experience,


783
00:43:57.080 --> 00:44:00.320
they value higher education and learning a bit more than some other people.


784
00:44:00.440 --> 00:44:03.560
A lot of Scorpio risings will value education,


785
00:44:03.560 --> 00:44:07.520
especially one that is going to be family approved. Um,


786
00:44:07.520 --> 00:44:10.880
but something that is gonna make them stand out and shine in whatever chosen


787
00:44:10.880 --> 00:44:11.760
field that they have,


788
00:44:11.760 --> 00:44:14.600
something that they can dive deep and do that nobody else can do.


789
00:44:15.100 --> 00:44:17.960
That's usually a Scorpio rising. Now,


790
00:44:18.230 --> 00:44:22.280
ways to generate income teaching and coaching, uh,


791
00:44:22.280 --> 00:44:26.240
this has to do with, um, anything that's online, anything that's in person.


792
00:44:26.240 --> 00:44:30.320
Sometimes it's fitness related. Remember the other planets all, uh,


793
00:44:30.320 --> 00:44:34.200
play into it sometimes as doing the stuff that I do where it's life coaching and


794
00:44:34.200 --> 00:44:38.840
mentoring. Uh, anything that is kind of consultancy based,


795
00:44:39.230 --> 00:44:42.240
that would also be their school teachers, university teachers,


796
00:44:42.400 --> 00:44:47.080
anything like that. Also teaching foreign languages because of the cultural, uh,


797
00:44:47.080 --> 00:44:50.560
part of this foreign lands, something cultural and kind of segueing into that.


798
00:44:50.560 --> 00:44:54.720
Foreign lands also says you're likely to make your money outside of where you


799
00:44:54.720 --> 00:44:55.340
were born.


800
00:44:55.340 --> 00:44:59.320
Either you're gonna make your money across the country more than 400 miles away


801
00:44:59.500 --> 00:45:02.800
or literally overseas, and it depends on what planets are, um,


802
00:45:03.460 --> 00:45:08.280
are a part of this learning and expanding. The more Scorpio rising deep,


803
00:45:09.260 --> 00:45:12.840
the more a Scorpio rising dives deeper into their chosen field.


804
00:45:12.920 --> 00:45:13.880
I kind of mentioned this before,


805
00:45:14.340 --> 00:45:17.400
the more money they will make because they know more, they learn more,


806
00:45:17.510 --> 00:45:20.600
they obsess over what they want, they find their own beliefs,


807
00:45:20.790 --> 00:45:23.400
they discard different things, and they put it all together. Now,


808
00:45:23.400 --> 00:45:27.640
what's interesting is I have a Jupiter in Scorpio,


809
00:45:27.780 --> 00:45:31.360
so it's kind of this energy when it comes to, uh, how it's placed,


810
00:45:31.360 --> 00:45:35.880
and that's on my ic. So this is all placed like this for me in astrology.


811
00:45:36.440 --> 00:45:40.400
I actually dove so deep into astrology, so deep into film, so deep into art,


812
00:45:40.420 --> 00:45:44.080
so deep into even when I sold cell phones for all the major carriers, when I,


813
00:45:44.400 --> 00:45:48.040
I went to each one, I knew more than everybody else. And it's,


814
00:45:49.180 --> 00:45:51.800
you know, you can be called names all day long. You're a know-it-all.


815
00:45:51.800 --> 00:45:53.080
You're this, you're a that, it doesn't matter.


816
00:45:53.240 --> 00:45:55.720
I did know I obsessed over it and what didn't work.


817
00:45:55.880 --> 00:45:57.920
I developed my own theories and philosophies,


818
00:45:57.920 --> 00:46:00.200
literally that Jupiter slash Sagittarian energy,


819
00:46:00.500 --> 00:46:02.080
and I pulled that together for astrology.


820
00:46:02.300 --> 00:46:05.120
People with Scorpio rising do that same thing for money.


821
00:46:05.580 --> 00:46:08.520
How they think money should work. They, they tend to,


822
00:46:08.790 --> 00:46:12.840
when used applicably and, and they harness their Pluto, their chart ruler,


823
00:46:13.070 --> 00:46:16.720
they can use this in conjunction with Jupi, which is their money ruler,


824
00:46:16.980 --> 00:46:20.360
to develop their own theories on how money are is to be made.


825
00:46:20.360 --> 00:46:24.280
So you'll see a lot of Scorpio risings making money in really weird ways in


826
00:46:24.450 --> 00:46:26.720
taboo ways, because that's what Scorpio rules.


827
00:46:26.830 --> 00:46:28.800
It's not accepted by the mainstream,


828
00:46:28.860 --> 00:46:31.560
but they make their money and you're just like, I don't know how you did that.


829
00:46:31.560 --> 00:46:33.640
They tell you and you're like, that doesn't sound right,


830
00:46:33.820 --> 00:46:35.720
but it is right because they figured it out.


831
00:46:35.720 --> 00:46:39.240
It doesn't sound right because no one else has done it. It's new and unique.


832
00:46:40.820 --> 00:46:45.240
Uh, let's see. And they create their own opportunities, like I said before,


833
00:46:45.420 --> 00:46:46.760
you know, opportunity will show,


834
00:46:46.820 --> 00:46:49.960
but especially if they have a Jupiter in retrograde, um,


835
00:46:50.510 --> 00:46:52.400
that Sagittarian ruler in retrograde,


836
00:46:52.400 --> 00:46:55.800
they have to create their own opportunities. And if you have that in your chart,


837
00:46:56.200 --> 00:46:59.840
remember I talk about retrograde planets in one of those, in the masterclass.


838
00:47:00.660 --> 00:47:03.720
Um, it's all about finding your own luck, finding your own theories,


839
00:47:03.720 --> 00:47:06.320
beliefs and creating your own opportunities.


840
00:47:06.540 --> 00:47:09.520
And that will actually bring you wealth as a Scorpio rising.


841
00:47:10.870 --> 00:47:15.240
Sagittarius rising. The second house is Capricorn. Capricorn is ruled by Saturn.


842
00:47:15.260 --> 00:47:18.800
So the money ruler is Saturn, wherever Saturn sits there. Now,


843
00:47:18.800 --> 00:47:22.960
what's interesting about sad rising is that because Saturn rules


844
00:47:23.750 --> 00:47:28.480
your, uh, your second house, Saturn also rules your career.


845
00:47:28.780 --> 00:47:32.400
So literally your career will bring you money as a Sagittarius rising,


846
00:47:32.840 --> 00:47:35.560
whatever that is. And if your, if your Saturn is in retrograde,


847
00:47:35.560 --> 00:47:39.520
you have to figure what that is for yourself. Often developing your own goals,


848
00:47:39.520 --> 00:47:41.840
your own ambitions, your own, um,


849
00:47:42.670 --> 00:47:46.280
your own sense of discipline and authority and create your own world basically.


850
00:47:46.790 --> 00:47:50.840
Sagittarius rising has a little bit of a one up because they like to travel,


851
00:47:50.910 --> 00:47:54.320
explore, and experience anyway. Sometimes these are late bloomers.


852
00:47:54.320 --> 00:47:57.200
Saturn tends to be a late bloomer, especially if it's in retrograde,


853
00:47:57.200 --> 00:48:00.720
but even when it's not. So Sagittarius rising, people tend to,


854
00:48:00.720 --> 00:48:03.280
at the beginning of life, seem like they don't know how to make money.


855
00:48:03.280 --> 00:48:05.040
Don't know what that they,


856
00:48:05.070 --> 00:48:09.040
they almost act like they don't need money because as long as they have enough


857
00:48:09.040 --> 00:48:12.960
to get by, uh, right here I have it as the relationship with money.


858
00:48:12.960 --> 00:48:15.520
They need the basics. They have enough to get by,


859
00:48:15.900 --> 00:48:19.760
and that often is enough for them, uh, working hard,


860
00:48:20.190 --> 00:48:21.840
slow and steady. These are all, again,


861
00:48:21.900 --> 00:48:24.280
if there's no adverse traits or anything like that, but again,


862
00:48:24.280 --> 00:48:26.800
it's also like they kind of have to grow into this.


863
00:48:27.030 --> 00:48:30.080
Capricorn energy doesn't start out this way, um,


864
00:48:30.080 --> 00:48:31.960
unless it's aspected a certain way,


865
00:48:31.960 --> 00:48:33.480
like through a square or something like that,


866
00:48:33.580 --> 00:48:37.680
or it's in the first house or anything like that. Um, but standard speaking,


867
00:48:37.950 --> 00:48:42.000
they grow into slow and steady gets into working hard. So later in life,


868
00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:44.640
they're very hard workers, but they need to find their way.


869
00:48:44.640 --> 00:48:47.200
They need to explore, they need to find their place in the world.


870
00:48:47.380 --> 00:48:50.720
And then they start putting in the hard work. They come, uh,


871
00:48:50.720 --> 00:48:53.160
a lot of their money comes through older systems and traditions.


872
00:48:53.180 --> 00:48:57.360
So they end up kind of aligning with their own beliefs and then they go back and


873
00:48:57.360 --> 00:49:02.240
find what like systems and jobs in play are going to allow them to do


874
00:49:02.240 --> 00:49:06.560
the thing that they do. Sagittarius rising, unless they have certain,


875
00:49:07.140 --> 00:49:10.800
you know, traits and whatnot, they're not usually the ones who, uh,


876
00:49:10.860 --> 00:49:15.280
go out and um, like reinvent the wheel and you know,


877
00:49:15.740 --> 00:49:18.640
is do like entrepreneur stuff that no one else has done.


878
00:49:18.640 --> 00:49:21.960
They tend to do things that are services that, um,


879
00:49:22.430 --> 00:49:26.600
that come from some sort of history, some sort of authority, some sort of,


880
00:49:26.670 --> 00:49:31.400
they bring all that in their second sixth and 10th houses are all earth houses.


881
00:49:31.830 --> 00:49:36.640
It's very much rooted instability and, and uh, security. Um,


882
00:49:36.640 --> 00:49:38.240
but they will find their own spin on it.


883
00:49:38.300 --> 00:49:40.280
And that's what Sagittarius is all about.


884
00:49:40.280 --> 00:49:43.240
Finding their own experience and what they feel like they want to do,


885
00:49:43.240 --> 00:49:46.200
to have stories to tell, to be able to kind of expand on that.


886
00:49:46.870 --> 00:49:49.880
They may take something that is already out there and while they're not


887
00:49:50.080 --> 00:49:50.760
reinventing on it,


888
00:49:50.760 --> 00:49:54.440
they are expanding upon it and they are adding what they can bring to the table


889
00:49:54.500 --> 00:49:56.480
to it to make that thing a better thing.


890
00:49:57.030 --> 00:50:00.280
Ways to generate income is climbing the ladder.


891
00:50:00.370 --> 00:50:02.280
These are the type of people that will literally,


892
00:50:02.630 --> 00:50:05.320
once they find what they're looking for and they found their place in the world,


893
00:50:05.320 --> 00:50:06.440
they're looking for that experience.


894
00:50:06.440 --> 00:50:09.800
They will take all the experience and all the steps to climb up to the top.


895
00:50:09.820 --> 00:50:14.520
And you may see them, um, as either CEOs or just under.


896
00:50:14.600 --> 00:50:19.240
I see a lot of satirizing is like vice presidents and stuff like that. Um,


897
00:50:19.580 --> 00:50:21.760
we see structure in utilizing systems.


898
00:50:22.280 --> 00:50:25.480
A lot of them are smart enough to understand that if I want to make an abundance


899
00:50:25.580 --> 00:50:29.200
of money using my Jupiter, that I need to use the systems in play.


900
00:50:29.220 --> 00:50:30.440
The financial systems,


901
00:50:30.440 --> 00:50:34.760
this is where finance actually plays in with Capricorn and Saturn is when it's


902
00:50:34.760 --> 00:50:38.000
sitting in the second house and relating to Venus in any way.


903
00:50:38.300 --> 00:50:41.960
So financial systems, these are stock market players, these are portfolio,


904
00:50:42.460 --> 00:50:47.160
you know, people who hold portfolios. These are, uh, gamblers and risk takers.


905
00:50:47.160 --> 00:50:51.000
They play the stock market, they know the systems and uh,


906
00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:53.880
it doesn't have to be just stocks. It can be anything that has a system.


907
00:50:53.950 --> 00:50:57.960
They will learn it and they will try to find a way to use it in their benefit


908
00:50:58.340 --> 00:51:00.800
to, you know, to give themselves more.


909
00:51:00.830 --> 00:51:05.160
Sagittarius wants more finding authority in money streams.


910
00:51:05.160 --> 00:51:09.880
This is where they find something that not only gives them, um,


911
00:51:10.070 --> 00:51:13.080
stability because that's extremely important and structure and foundation,


912
00:51:13.080 --> 00:51:16.040
but something that other people appreciate them for and they get respect for,


913
00:51:16.660 --> 00:51:19.480
and that's what they're seeking with their, um, with money.


914
00:51:19.540 --> 00:51:21.640
So that's what they tend to align with, uh,


915
00:51:21.640 --> 00:51:25.760
when it's on the positive here and setting up long-term goals.


916
00:51:25.900 --> 00:51:28.680
So they end up, sometimes they'll play the short game,


917
00:51:28.680 --> 00:51:31.200
but a lot of these people, especially if they're in stock market, whatever,


918
00:51:31.200 --> 00:51:35.600
they're not looking to be day traders as much as they are looking for, you know,


919
00:51:35.600 --> 00:51:38.960
patterns and how things play out. Um, through international,


920
00:51:38.960 --> 00:51:40.480
they're looking at the big picture.


921
00:51:40.910 --> 00:51:43.800
They tend to see things as they play out the long way.


922
00:51:43.820 --> 00:51:48.760
So if you're getting into financing of any way, um, then you should be,


923
00:51:48.900 --> 00:51:51.840
uh, as a Sagittarius rising, you should be looking at the long game,


924
00:51:51.860 --> 00:51:54.480
and that would be, that would bring you the most income.


925
00:51:54.480 --> 00:51:57.800
Is is not playing the short game unless your energy favors it.


926
00:51:59.270 --> 00:52:03.840
Capricorn rising second house is Aquarius. Aquarius is ruled by Uranus.


927
00:52:03.840 --> 00:52:06.960
So obviously wherever Uranus is in your char, we'll add more along with Venus.


928
00:52:07.060 --> 00:52:07.920
As we've said before,


929
00:52:07.940 --> 00:52:11.960
the relationship for a Capricorn rising with Aquarius is that money seems to


930
00:52:11.960 --> 00:52:14.400
come and go. It's like no matter how hard they work for it,


931
00:52:14.570 --> 00:52:15.640
money just kind of like,


932
00:52:15.740 --> 00:52:20.000
either they spend it or they go through periods of time where they have work,


933
00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:20.880
they don't have work.


934
00:52:21.140 --> 00:52:24.920
And that's because the air signs in the second sixth and 10th house is like


935
00:52:24.920 --> 00:52:29.120
they're ready. They wanna work assuming that their Saturn is well aspected,


936
00:52:29.620 --> 00:52:33.720
but finding the thing that doesn't make them bored, um,


937
00:52:33.820 --> 00:52:36.520
and where they feel at peace and balanced and, uh,


938
00:52:36.860 --> 00:52:40.000
and accepted can be very difficult for them.


939
00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:43.400
So they tend to jump jobs and try different things. Uh,


940
00:52:43.400 --> 00:52:46.960
if they have a stronger Saturn, they will not have the, um,


941
00:52:47.260 --> 00:52:51.720
the downtime as much, but if they have a weaker or retrograde or whatever,


942
00:52:51.720 --> 00:52:52.553
Saturn in there,


943
00:52:52.630 --> 00:52:56.320
then you may see people with the Aquarius in the second house have a lot of


944
00:52:56.320 --> 00:53:00.880
downtime between jobs. They tend to spend on their friends. Uh,


945
00:53:00.880 --> 00:53:02.840
it's very important. They, they have the authority,


946
00:53:02.910 --> 00:53:04.320
they feel like they're the man.


947
00:53:04.320 --> 00:53:06.520
Sometimes they play that role a little bit too much.


948
00:53:06.750 --> 00:53:09.240
They get their little posse together, their team, their groups.


949
00:53:09.310 --> 00:53:13.240
They'll buy everybody's shots at the bar. They'll, you know, buy gifts.


950
00:53:13.240 --> 00:53:16.040
They'll do the, you know, different things. And, um,


951
00:53:16.040 --> 00:53:20.480
they tend to have less money as a result of this. Obviously, if their,


952
00:53:21.380 --> 00:53:24.880
if their chart is the other way around, they try to mooch off their friends,


953
00:53:24.880 --> 00:53:29.400
but that's a whole different thing. They're looking for new ways to make money.


954
00:53:29.400 --> 00:53:30.680
That's the thing about Capricorns.


955
00:53:30.680 --> 00:53:35.040
And a lot of people associate Capricorns with money. It's not directly,


956
00:53:35.100 --> 00:53:37.960
but a Capricorn rising is always looking for the next thing.


957
00:53:38.030 --> 00:53:40.360
They're the ones who are like, oh, cryptocurrency. It's like,


958
00:53:40.360 --> 00:53:44.360
it's a system I identify with, but this is the new way to do it, system,


959
00:53:44.740 --> 00:53:45.220
new way.


960
00:53:45.220 --> 00:53:48.720
That's kind of how it is with Aquarius in the second house as a Capricorn rising


961
00:53:49.380 --> 00:53:53.280
and constant change in jobs and sources is because of the Gemini in the sixth


962
00:53:53.280 --> 00:53:56.040
house. Because you have Uranus as the planet ruler,


963
00:53:56.040 --> 00:53:57.000
you're always looking for change.


964
00:53:57.030 --> 00:54:01.280
Each one of those changes is really trying to find yourself and figure out your


965
00:54:01.730 --> 00:54:05.680
uniqueness. If you end up as a Capricorn rising, doing Capricorn type stuff,


966
00:54:05.910 --> 00:54:10.640
just standard CEO stuff, standard, you know, hard work, labor, work,


967
00:54:10.920 --> 00:54:14.360
anything like that, you're going to find as a Capricorn rising that you're,


968
00:54:14.360 --> 00:54:16.840
you're just not gonna be happy. You're gonna constantly want to quit.


969
00:54:16.860 --> 00:54:19.680
Do another job, find another way to transfer, try this over here,


970
00:54:19.700 --> 00:54:24.440
do that because you're seeking how you can have value in your


971
00:54:24.490 --> 00:54:27.520
uniqueness and what you bring individually to the table.


972
00:54:27.580 --> 00:54:29.200
If it's a type of job where your,


973
00:54:29.500 --> 00:54:32.040
you were hired for your skills that no one else has,


974
00:54:32.140 --> 00:54:36.320
you're gonna be a lot happier ways to generate money. Tech,


975
00:54:36.870 --> 00:54:40.120
tech and online. So cryptocurrency, um,


976
00:54:40.520 --> 00:54:45.040
anything that is technology based. Anything that's like online social media, um,


977
00:54:45.100 --> 00:54:45.400
you know,


978
00:54:45.400 --> 00:54:49.720
diving deep with that kind of stuff and finding a way to transmute that into


979
00:54:49.720 --> 00:54:51.440
something that is what you want.


980
00:54:51.440 --> 00:54:56.120
Because Scorpio in the 11th house with social media for a Capricorn rising is


981
00:54:56.120 --> 00:54:58.200
not traditionally the thing they want to do,


982
00:54:59.100 --> 00:55:00.760
but if they find a way to kind of like,


983
00:55:01.500 --> 00:55:05.760
see the hidden value in it and find a way to use that, then they will do it.


984
00:55:05.870 --> 00:55:08.920
Also, Capricorn rising tends to not, again,


985
00:55:08.920 --> 00:55:10.920
it depends on where the sun is and all these things,


986
00:55:11.020 --> 00:55:16.000
but just blanket statement doesn't wanna show their face, uh, on camera anyway,


987
00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:16.840
on social media.


988
00:55:16.940 --> 00:55:21.840
So they tend to do things where they can promote whatever they're doing in


989
00:55:21.920 --> 00:55:24.640
a new, inventive, creative way,


990
00:55:25.170 --> 00:55:28.680
where they are not necessarily putting themselves on camera like everybody else.


991
00:55:28.710 --> 00:55:31.400
It's something that is going to make them stand apart,


992
00:55:31.660 --> 00:55:35.880
but still kind of utilizes traditional methods of doing it.


993
00:55:37.110 --> 00:55:41.400
Sources that fluctuate. This again, could be cryptocurrency, could be, uh,


994
00:55:41.600 --> 00:55:42.920
anything that has to do with digital currency,


995
00:55:42.940 --> 00:55:46.320
it could have to do with anything that's tech related. Anything that it's,


996
00:55:46.670 --> 00:55:50.520
it's value, uh, is not constant the entire time.


997
00:55:50.520 --> 00:55:53.320
There's a lot of Capricorn in the stock market as well.


998
00:55:53.770 --> 00:55:56.880
Automation and future proofing. This is all about, again,


999
00:55:56.880 --> 00:56:01.320
diving deep into how we can utilize, um, technology within,


1000
00:56:02.180 --> 00:56:06.880
uh, the way that we make money, how we can bring in networking groups, teams,


1001
00:56:07.700 --> 00:56:12.600
um, small businesses, all of that into here. Uh, anything that,


1002
00:56:12.600 --> 00:56:15.680
again, future-proofing, anything, this technology is gonna bring it in,


1003
00:56:15.680 --> 00:56:20.640
that's gonna create security is another way. So that's Capricorn rising.


1004
00:56:21.360 --> 00:56:25.040
Aquarius rising Second house is Pisces. Pisces is ruled by Neptune.


1005
00:56:25.060 --> 00:56:29.320
So look for Neptune in the chart for further information, the relationship,


1006
00:56:29.750 --> 00:56:31.720
some Aquarius rising people,


1007
00:56:32.150 --> 00:56:36.120
because they are future oriented. They're all about society,


1008
00:56:36.300 --> 00:56:38.600
humanitarianism, and, uh,


1009
00:56:38.600 --> 00:56:43.600
how they kind of are the future in some ways. And in some ways they are,


1010
00:56:44.100 --> 00:56:47.480
uh, because that PI is in the second house when it comes to values, possessions,


1011
00:56:47.480 --> 00:56:50.640
and money, oftentimes they feel like they don't need money. You know,


1012
00:56:50.750 --> 00:56:54.800
it's the future. It's, it's unnecessary. I'm unconventional. I'm,


1013
00:56:54.800 --> 00:56:58.680
I don't go with the norm. And they can see money as a more Capricorn thing,


1014
00:56:59.030 --> 00:57:02.160
whereas urines are, uh, yeah, Uranus, which rules Aquarius.


1015
00:57:02.160 --> 00:57:06.160
Aquarius is trying to be different, trying to rebel. I don't need money.


1016
00:57:06.160 --> 00:57:10.040
Oftentimes they end up having a hard time keeping money and having a hard time


1017
00:57:10.480 --> 00:57:13.400
materializing money because Pisces is in that second house.


1018
00:57:13.440 --> 00:57:16.080
I can almost feel like money's never there, and I don't know how to get it.


1019
00:57:16.390 --> 00:57:19.000
It's like every time it's like right outta my grasp,


1020
00:57:19.060 --> 00:57:22.680
or every time I think I have it, it's an illusion. It just disappears.


1021
00:57:22.910 --> 00:57:27.120
It's a disappear in a different way than when, uh, Scorpio was in this house.


1022
00:57:27.120 --> 00:57:31.520
But it can feel like it, it's very hard to attain if they do have it.


1023
00:57:31.710 --> 00:57:34.920
It's almost like they lose track of what they have and then all of a sudden it


1024
00:57:34.970 --> 00:57:39.080
feels like they should have had more money, but now they're out of money.


1025
00:57:39.500 --> 00:57:42.480
And then there's a spiritual connection to the material world.


1026
00:57:43.030 --> 00:57:45.240
When they go too far into the, into the Pisces,


1027
00:57:45.240 --> 00:57:47.560
they end up losing the connection to the material world.


1028
00:57:47.780 --> 00:57:51.200
If they have a spiritual connection to the material world, uh,


1029
00:57:51.200 --> 00:57:55.040
sometimes it can be a little bit too much where they over idolize money.


1030
00:57:55.420 --> 00:57:59.840
So it can be not only that they don't, if they do or they want badly,


1031
00:57:59.870 --> 00:58:03.800
sometimes they can see that money is a, um,


1032
00:58:04.230 --> 00:58:07.440
like an idealistic thing. Like, uh, like perfection.


1033
00:58:07.440 --> 00:58:12.440
That's the one thing that everybody needs right now to be able to use


1034
00:58:12.440 --> 00:58:14.960
this energy and generate money. Creativity,


1035
00:58:15.600 --> 00:58:19.680
Aquarius Rising is all about using your individuality and making money through


1036
00:58:20.040 --> 00:58:21.680
creative endeavor, spiritual work,


1037
00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:24.480
anything that's behind the scenes and anything that's medically related.


1038
00:58:24.580 --> 00:58:28.480
All that Pisces Energy, this includes dance, it includes, um,


1039
00:58:28.640 --> 00:58:31.160
a lot of people who have this, uh, are set up,


1040
00:58:31.160 --> 00:58:35.400
especially with the way that the generational planets have been lately for video


1041
00:58:35.450 --> 00:58:38.880
games. This literally right here could be video games,


1042
00:58:38.880 --> 00:58:41.840
depending on where Uranus and Neptune are both situated in the chart and how


1043
00:58:41.840 --> 00:58:44.360
they're aspected. This could be one way that they do it.


1044
00:58:44.680 --> 00:58:47.920
A lot of Aquarius rising in film and entertainment as well,


1045
00:58:48.570 --> 00:58:51.200
especially if they're kind of like doing their own thing,


1046
00:58:51.440 --> 00:58:55.200
especially with that seventh house Leo here and then looking at their sun


1047
00:58:55.200 --> 00:59:00.000
placement for further it is water. So using intuition, using, um,


1048
00:59:00.580 --> 00:59:04.880
you know, their gut feelings and doing things differently that are,


1049
00:59:05.900 --> 00:59:10.480
um, having that mysterious, like taboo element of it that,


1050
00:59:11.030 --> 00:59:15.440
that, uh, not really sure what they're doing or how they're doing it,


1051
00:59:15.820 --> 00:59:16.960
but they're making it work.


1052
00:59:17.130 --> 00:59:19.960
Those type of people generate a lot of money doing that, but again,


1053
00:59:19.970 --> 00:59:24.960
using creativity is huge for them. And, uh,


1054
00:59:25.470 --> 00:59:28.520
also taking a look, obviously at the sixth and 10th house placements,


1055
00:59:28.940 --> 00:59:31.720
but Aquarius Rising is all about, uh,


1056
00:59:31.720 --> 00:59:35.640
using your intuition to guide you as well into what is a good investment,


1057
00:59:35.670 --> 00:59:38.200
what is a bad investment? If I buy something, is it worth it?


1058
00:59:38.420 --> 00:59:41.520
Use your intuition. Your intuition will tell you, I shouldn't buy this.


1059
00:59:41.880 --> 00:59:44.400
I don't know why, but I feel like I,


1060
00:59:44.640 --> 00:59:48.120
I could either get a better deal or there's something wrong with this,


1061
00:59:48.120 --> 00:59:52.720
or whatever. Listen to that because that's all part of your, your earth.


1062
00:59:53.460 --> 00:59:55.280
Uh, houses are water rules.


1063
00:59:55.300 --> 01:00:00.200
So it's all about intuition and using that for guidance. Excuse me.


1064
01:00:00.980 --> 01:00:05.600
And Pisces rising. Second ha, second ha. Harry's house.


1065
01:00:05.880 --> 01:00:08.960
Aries second house is in Aries, which is Mars rules.


1066
01:00:09.020 --> 01:00:11.720
So Mars in the chart is gonna tell you more about how you make money in your


1067
01:00:11.720 --> 01:00:15.080
relationship with money. It's a very selfish placement. Uh,


1068
01:00:15.180 --> 01:00:17.840
Pisces is interesting because very go with the flow,


1069
01:00:18.180 --> 01:00:21.880
but Aries is the baby doesn't really know but wants to do for themselves.


1070
01:00:22.580 --> 01:00:26.080
So they have this interesting dichotomy of, um,


1071
01:00:26.080 --> 01:00:29.560
toward that feeling of towards enlightenment, being Neptune ruled,


1072
01:00:29.740 --> 01:00:32.840
but then having their values and their sense of, um,


1073
01:00:32.950 --> 01:00:37.000
like money and finance and everything, tying them to the material world, uh,


1074
01:00:37.020 --> 01:00:39.400
in terms of value being Aries,


1075
01:00:39.460 --> 01:00:42.680
and then in their sixth house of the actual material world and,


1076
01:00:42.780 --> 01:00:46.760
and work being Leo. So that fire energy is like,


1077
01:00:46.760 --> 01:00:50.720
they have this passion and this creativity and this drive and this motivation to


1078
01:00:50.820 --> 01:00:55.000
do, but then because they're, uh, Neptune ruled in Pisces rising,


1079
01:00:55.430 --> 01:00:59.240
they don't know what to do. And it's just because that second house there again,


1080
01:00:59.860 --> 01:01:03.200
is, uh, Aries starting over with the baby. So it's like you're,


1081
01:01:03.500 --> 01:01:07.320
you're coming in with that ascendant that is, you know, at the end of the cycle,


1082
01:01:07.780 --> 01:01:09.840
and then you're crossing back over into the beginning.


1083
01:01:09.840 --> 01:01:13.440
So it can be very difficult for a lot of Pisces Risings to figure out what they


1084
01:01:13.440 --> 01:01:15.640
do. Once they do though,


1085
01:01:16.110 --> 01:01:19.320
they will lock in and they will make a hell a lot of money,


1086
01:01:19.660 --> 01:01:24.280
and that's Pisces Rising are so underrated. Uh, just generically, again,


1087
01:01:24.560 --> 01:01:28.480
umbrella speaking, because once they figure this out, they're on their way.


1088
01:01:28.500 --> 01:01:31.840
But it, you know, a lot of their life, some people never do,


1089
01:01:31.860 --> 01:01:32.720
but a lot of their life,


1090
01:01:32.720 --> 01:01:35.360
they have a hard time figuring out which way they're supposed to go. Well,


1091
01:01:36.260 --> 01:01:40.400
Pisces Rising also has a hard time because everyone tells them they shouldn't do


1092
01:01:40.720 --> 01:01:43.720
creative jobs, get a real job. And this is not just Pisces Rising,


1093
01:01:44.030 --> 01:01:44.880
this is other people,


1094
01:01:44.880 --> 01:01:46.840
especially if you have different configurations in your chart.


1095
01:01:46.860 --> 01:01:50.520
But creative jobs aren't real jobs. Music's not a real job.


1096
01:01:50.520 --> 01:01:53.960
This is not a real job, not a real job. And they hear that and they feel that,


1097
01:01:54.460 --> 01:01:58.760
and they're so sensitive that it can shut them down. When in reality,


1098
01:01:58.820 --> 01:02:01.600
if they just listen to themselves for a Pisces Rising,


1099
01:02:01.600 --> 01:02:06.080
they would do much better. The relationship is driven, but aimless, it's like,


1100
01:02:06.120 --> 01:02:07.040
I know I want to do,


1101
01:02:07.040 --> 01:02:10.080
but I don't know what they can make money when they need to.


1102
01:02:10.110 --> 01:02:14.120
It's like they have this mysterious ability that if they really need to money,


1103
01:02:15.030 --> 01:02:18.400
make money, they can find something, make a little bit of money,


1104
01:02:18.760 --> 01:02:20.160
whatever they need for the time being,


1105
01:02:20.660 --> 01:02:23.040
and then they're kind of back to the same situation again.


1106
01:02:23.500 --> 01:02:26.160
All they have to do is channel that into something they really want to do


1107
01:02:26.160 --> 01:02:29.120
instead of something that is just going to help them in their situation.


1108
01:02:29.950 --> 01:02:34.800
They tend to have an ability to spend money quickly, impulsively and selfishly,


1109
01:02:35.160 --> 01:02:37.840
I want this for me. I like this. I don't care.


1110
01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.400
I don't have any of the details about this. I just think I like it.


1111
01:02:40.460 --> 01:02:41.293
And they take it.


1112
01:02:41.450 --> 01:02:45.000
Oftentimes they ignore their intuition on what's a good purchase and what's a


1113
01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:48.960
bad purchase, because that areas takes over and it's like, I want it, I want it.


1114
01:02:50.340 --> 01:02:51.920
And then they don't always know how to make money,


1115
01:02:51.920 --> 01:02:53.960
which we kind of talked about before. They're very aimless.


1116
01:02:53.960 --> 01:02:56.960
It's like once they figure out how to make money, it's, it's go time.


1117
01:02:57.020 --> 01:03:01.320
But until then, which can be a long time for some of them, um, it can create,


1118
01:03:01.900 --> 01:03:04.040
uh, ha uh, wreak havoc in their chart.


1119
01:03:04.380 --> 01:03:08.120
How do they generate money doing something new? Do something that's different.


1120
01:03:08.180 --> 01:03:13.000
Use your intuition and as inspiration take clues and cues from the,


1121
01:03:13.140 --> 01:03:16.120
uh, universe and the environment to guide you.


1122
01:03:16.660 --> 01:03:21.560
Pisces is an ethereal sign. As a rising sign. Aries is pioneering. It's new,


1123
01:03:21.560 --> 01:03:24.400
it's the new cycle. Stop trying to do what everybody else is doing.


1124
01:03:24.740 --> 01:03:29.160
Do your own thing. Come up with new ideas and follow that. Be the boss.


1125
01:03:29.900 --> 01:03:33.600
Pisces Rising is sensitive, but they are very different type of boss.


1126
01:03:33.630 --> 01:03:36.760
They are a good compassionate boss when they're doing their own thing.


1127
01:03:36.760 --> 01:03:39.360
They can be very meticulous with the people that they're working with,


1128
01:03:39.860 --> 01:03:43.120
but they can be very expansion, expansive and philosophical.


1129
01:03:43.380 --> 01:03:47.120
As a mentor or as a boss. They're very good at coaching other people,


1130
01:03:47.120 --> 01:03:50.160
which is a very different type of authority than let's say,


1131
01:03:50.160 --> 01:03:55.160
Capricorn there or even Leo there. Uh, anything that has to do with solo act,


1132
01:03:55.160 --> 01:03:56.320
things that you can do for yourself,


1133
01:03:56.320 --> 01:03:59.520
especially if it's creative or spiritual in nature, uh,


1134
01:03:59.640 --> 01:04:04.000
hands-on approach is definitely gonna be the way forward for you being engaged,


1135
01:04:04.110 --> 01:04:07.360
interactive in what you're doing, sometimes even physically doing the grunt.


1136
01:04:07.360 --> 01:04:09.360
Work yourself, at least for some of it.


1137
01:04:09.860 --> 01:04:14.240
And remember that Pisces Rising can also be the product.


1138
01:04:14.620 --> 01:04:16.640
You can promote yourself as the thing.


1139
01:04:16.860 --> 01:04:19.840
Leo in the sixth house is all about creativity and whatnot,


1140
01:04:19.840 --> 01:04:22.200
but they like the spotlight. Generically speaking,


1141
01:04:22.270 --> 01:04:23.280
they want to be in the spotlight.


1142
01:04:23.420 --> 01:04:26.640
So the best way you can do this as a Pisces Rising is to go sing,


1143
01:04:26.700 --> 01:04:29.640
be on Broadway, go dance, go use your creativity.


1144
01:04:29.700 --> 01:04:32.920
And obviously it doesn't have to be the normal film, music, whatever.


1145
01:04:33.220 --> 01:04:37.120
It can also be like making things, um, designing, painting.


1146
01:04:37.910 --> 01:04:41.120
There's so many creative avenues that you can go and the rest of your chart is


1147
01:04:41.120 --> 01:04:43.640
really gonna narrow it down on how that will play out for you.


1148
01:04:44.380 --> 01:04:48.640
So the second house ruler we were talking about here through the houses. Um,


1149
01:04:48.740 --> 01:04:51.320
if your second house ruler, doesn't matter what it is,


1150
01:04:51.340 --> 01:04:54.720
if your second house ruler is sitting, let's say it's TAUs in the second house.


1151
01:04:54.720 --> 01:04:57.320
If Venus is in the first house, if aria's in the second house,


1152
01:04:57.430 --> 01:05:00.800
Mars is in the first house wherever the ruler of the second house is,


1153
01:05:00.820 --> 01:05:02.200
if it is in the first house,


1154
01:05:02.630 --> 01:05:07.240
this requires you to make money to use physical action, your physical body,


1155
01:05:07.350 --> 01:05:08.680
something pioneering.


1156
01:05:09.220 --> 01:05:13.000
It might not even be your body if it has to do with like Aquarius and wellness


1157
01:05:13.020 --> 01:05:15.600
and things like that. It might be just the body in general,


1158
01:05:15.670 --> 01:05:17.320
like Reiki healing and things like that.


1159
01:05:17.320 --> 01:05:20.480
Something that has to do with the body and something where it's hands on.


1160
01:05:20.510 --> 01:05:24.200
Something that you're actively engaged in in the second house.


1161
01:05:24.550 --> 01:05:29.240
It's literally products and possessions and items. Finance, ethics,


1162
01:05:29.300 --> 01:05:32.880
values and just money for the sake of making money.


1163
01:05:32.880 --> 01:05:34.920
Money stacks on stacks as they say.


1164
01:05:35.710 --> 01:05:38.960
Your second house ruler in the third house has to do with communication,


1165
01:05:39.050 --> 01:05:42.560
using your physical hands as opposed to being hands-on and being engaged.


1166
01:05:42.630 --> 01:05:45.560
More about typing or coding or, uh,


1167
01:05:45.560 --> 01:05:48.920
drawing or something where your hands are actually the, um,


1168
01:05:50.100 --> 01:05:51.520
the apparatus that you use.


1169
01:05:52.090 --> 01:05:56.720
Sales ideas being the idea person coming across. And then education,


1170
01:05:56.720 --> 01:06:00.800
usually lower end education or things that are surface or anything data driven,


1171
01:06:01.900 --> 01:06:04.360
uh, can also be something where it is, um,


1172
01:06:05.030 --> 01:06:08.480
like communications and uh, like, uh, accounting, right?


1173
01:06:08.480 --> 01:06:11.320
Second house rule in the third house could be accounting as well. Or in Gemini.


1174
01:06:12.300 --> 01:06:15.280
Second house rule in the fourth house could be something headquarters based


1175
01:06:15.280 --> 01:06:19.800
where there's a home office, uh, your physical home, real estate, uh,


1176
01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:23.760
anything that is personal or close to you that deals with emotions, mood,


1177
01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:27.200
anything like that. Something with intuition, nurturing. And then family.


1178
01:06:27.520 --> 01:06:29.360
Anything that is family based. If you, if you're,


1179
01:06:29.360 --> 01:06:32.640
it's like a combination of things that have to do with Pisces and Neptunes in


1180
01:06:32.640 --> 01:06:35.360
the fourth house. It could be opening up your own medical practice.


1181
01:06:35.900 --> 01:06:38.800
And obviously you look at your sixth and 10th house in mid-heaven and ascendant


1182
01:06:39.300 --> 01:06:42.600
two, you know, wrap it all up to see exactly how, but this is the basics.


1183
01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:47.440
Remember basics, fifth House, second House, ruler in the fifth house.


1184
01:06:47.880 --> 01:06:50.400
Anything that has to do with creativity of any sort.


1185
01:06:50.640 --> 01:06:54.800
Creative expression of any kind, usually of a physical nature. Entertainment,


1186
01:06:55.200 --> 01:06:58.160
children, recreation and things that are fun. Also, romance.


1187
01:06:58.660 --> 01:07:02.960
So a lot of people who have like Mercury in their second house and um,


1188
01:07:04.460 --> 01:07:06.200
uh, Mer uh, I'm sorry,


1189
01:07:06.200 --> 01:07:09.720
Gemini in the second house in Mercury is in their fifth house. They might be a,


1190
01:07:10.140 --> 01:07:14.480
uh, romance novel author, the sixth house, uh,


1191
01:07:14.480 --> 01:07:16.640
second House ruler and the sixth House. All about services.


1192
01:07:16.640 --> 01:07:19.720
That's the main thing, really. Services, but then health, uh,


1193
01:07:19.920 --> 01:07:23.840
anything that is organizational deals with details work, um,


1194
01:07:24.500 --> 01:07:25.680
is kind of, uh, um,


1195
01:07:27.130 --> 01:07:29.680
often not in the same way as Libra or Seventh House,


1196
01:07:29.680 --> 01:07:33.560
but it's kind of like a liaison between the one per, not between two people,


1197
01:07:33.900 --> 01:07:37.280
but to one person. So they're the one that is always helping.


1198
01:07:37.280 --> 01:07:41.600
They're the helper, which is basically service, but it's the helper. Um, sign,


1199
01:07:41.820 --> 01:07:45.400
second house ruling, the seventh House partnership, huge. Anything legal,


1200
01:07:45.960 --> 01:07:49.880
anything dealing with fashion and beauty. That is all seventh house stuff.


1201
01:07:49.990 --> 01:07:53.880
Partnership is huge for that though. And finding balance and mediation.


1202
01:07:53.880 --> 01:07:56.280
It could be something that deals with tact and diplomacy as well.


1203
01:07:56.900 --> 01:08:00.640
Second house rule in the eighth house is, uh, investing, shared resources,


1204
01:08:00.640 --> 01:08:02.120
transformation, things that are taboo.


1205
01:08:02.120 --> 01:08:04.360
Things that are not accepted by the mainstream society.


1206
01:08:04.360 --> 01:08:08.200
Things where you have to dive deeper in order to come out the other side and


1207
01:08:08.600 --> 01:08:11.920
transform whatever it is you are doing, kind of like I did with astrology,


1208
01:08:12.250 --> 01:08:15.810
where I've transformed it into something that is usable as opposed to just pop


1209
01:08:15.810 --> 01:08:17.830
culture stuff we chat about. That's cute and fun.


1210
01:08:17.990 --> 01:08:21.040
This is something you can actually apply. I have that, uh,


1211
01:08:21.040 --> 01:08:25.560
eighth house energy there. I did it with film as well. Ninth house, uh,


1212
01:08:25.820 --> 01:08:28.360
has to do with higher education beliefs, international and,


1213
01:08:28.360 --> 01:08:31.080
and a lot of times it's things that have to do with travel as well.


1214
01:08:31.460 --> 01:08:34.000
So if you're doing travel and travel includes vacation.


1215
01:08:34.060 --> 01:08:37.560
So if you have like the moon in the ninth house and your second house is in


1216
01:08:37.560 --> 01:08:41.040
cancer, it could be that you're doing either, uh, you know,


1217
01:08:41.040 --> 01:08:44.680
construction or real estate of some sort on international, uh,


1218
01:08:44.710 --> 01:08:48.080
soil or you're doing travel homes or vacation rentals or something like that.


1219
01:08:48.900 --> 01:08:52.840
Second house ruler in the 10th house is anything that is corporate.


1220
01:08:52.920 --> 01:08:55.600
A lot of people with their second house ruler sitting up in the 10th house,


1221
01:08:55.750 --> 01:08:59.160
they end up working for a corporation, usually a major corporation,


1222
01:08:59.160 --> 01:09:02.400
something where they're either public facing or is something that is very


1223
01:09:02.400 --> 01:09:05.760
publicly known, uh, traditional or a very old company.


1224
01:09:05.780 --> 01:09:08.600
One that's been around for a long time or something that is dealing with systems


1225
01:09:08.700 --> 01:09:10.920
or the government. The government, I didn't list,


1226
01:09:10.940 --> 01:09:12.240
but it is part of that as well.


1227
01:09:12.660 --> 01:09:16.240
The second house ruler in the 11th house has to do with the future of future


1228
01:09:16.240 --> 01:09:18.880
proofing things, technology, non-conventional things,


1229
01:09:18.880 --> 01:09:23.720
things that are rebellious or, uh, redesigning systems and changing them,


1230
01:09:23.720 --> 01:09:28.440
making them new, uh, groups. And, uh,


1231
01:09:28.440 --> 01:09:31.560
there's something else in my brain and I totally forgot it. Groups, teams,


1232
01:09:33.270 --> 01:09:35.640
society, oh, humanitarian efforts as well.


1233
01:09:36.020 --> 01:09:39.720
The second house ruler in the 12th house. Anything that is creative,


1234
01:09:40.120 --> 01:09:42.560
spiritual music, media behind the scenes or medical,


1235
01:09:42.930 --> 01:09:44.600
those are all the 12th house things.


1236
01:09:44.760 --> 01:09:48.120
A lot of times you'll see people who are heavily creative and spiritual because


1237
01:09:48.120 --> 01:09:52.080
Neptune, which rules the 12th house natively, uh, rules, all those things.


1238
01:09:52.180 --> 01:09:54.920
So this is a list here that you can refer to. Again,


1239
01:09:54.920 --> 01:09:56.640
you've heard me say a couple of things that aren't here.


1240
01:09:56.640 --> 01:09:59.640
These are the basic things that would fit on the paper so that you could easily


1241
01:09:59.640 --> 01:10:01.360
read it, um,


1242
01:10:01.980 --> 01:10:04.960
so that you can get an understanding of how the Second House ruler ties in.


1243
01:10:05.380 --> 01:10:07.920
Now let's use a couple of examples real quick here.


1244
01:10:08.240 --> 01:10:12.480
I wanna go through the first one, Dr. Dre. Uh, you know, I was gonna,


1245
01:10:13.020 --> 01:10:15.960
in one of my classes in the, um, masterclass,


1246
01:10:16.240 --> 01:10:19.280
I pretended like they weren't real people and then I showed you who they were.


1247
01:10:19.340 --> 01:10:21.320
I'm just gonna tell you who they are, Dr. Dre here,


1248
01:10:21.320 --> 01:10:25.280
and I'm not gonna go through everything. Remember that your Saturn placement,


1249
01:10:25.280 --> 01:10:27.880
your Capricorn, your 10th house, your sixth house, your second house,


1250
01:10:27.880 --> 01:10:31.680
your first house, they all matter. Saturn and Pisces,


1251
01:10:31.680 --> 01:10:35.320
you already know that this guy's into music and whatnot. But Saturn, um,


1252
01:10:35.660 --> 01:10:38.280
up here, I'm not gonna go too much into Saturn placements for these,


1253
01:10:38.300 --> 01:10:41.200
but I just want to touch on it real quick. Saturn in, in the 10th house as well,


1254
01:10:41.500 --> 01:10:45.680
is kind of like that leader that, um, has the authority within music.


1255
01:10:46.180 --> 01:10:48.640
And Kyron is, he's had his own issues and whatnot, you know,


1256
01:10:48.700 --> 01:10:51.360
as a father and things of that nature. Uh,


1257
01:10:51.690 --> 01:10:55.280
which is interesting cuz now that I say that, I remember something about him.


1258
01:10:56.300 --> 01:10:58.280
Um, second house in cancer, empty house.


1259
01:10:58.280 --> 01:11:00.480
So we don't have any reverse rulerships to look at here.


1260
01:11:00.780 --> 01:11:03.080
Cancer we talked about before, uh,


1261
01:11:03.220 --> 01:11:07.560
Gemini has to do with using the hands and doing things that are, um,


1262
01:11:07.870 --> 01:11:09.520
with the mid-heaven in Aquarius,


1263
01:11:09.520 --> 01:11:14.040
has to do with things that are rhythmic with the combination here. Um,


1264
01:11:15.100 --> 01:11:18.480
its ruler is over here in the fifth house. So automatically entertainment.


1265
01:11:18.900 --> 01:11:22.720
And this is, uh, Libra, which has to do with anything that has to do with, uh,


1266
01:11:22.720 --> 01:11:26.800
other people being public, facing, legal, you know, all the le the,


1267
01:11:26.980 --> 01:11:29.720
the Libra stuff that we talked about before and partnerships.


1268
01:11:30.420 --> 01:11:32.680
And his first job was a dj.


1269
01:11:33.120 --> 01:11:35.200
I did read that while I was putting this all together.


1270
01:11:35.280 --> 01:11:38.440
I didn't know that before, but that is right here.


1271
01:11:38.440 --> 01:11:42.320
His second house ruler of making money, his first job, he went right into, uh,


1272
01:11:42.320 --> 01:11:47.080
with the public here doing something that was cool, that was like trendy. Uh,


1273
01:11:47.100 --> 01:11:51.240
and then obviously Neptune in his sixth house brings music back in as well.


1274
01:11:51.260 --> 01:11:54.720
But this is entertainment in general, doing something that is fun,


1275
01:11:54.720 --> 01:11:58.120
doing something that he feels like intuitively inclined to do and always


1276
01:11:58.120 --> 01:12:02.040
partnership. So if you know anything about Dr. Dre, he obviously had his group,


1277
01:12:02.420 --> 01:12:04.040
um, NWA when he first started.


1278
01:12:04.140 --> 01:12:06.440
That's his midheaven and all this energy in Aquarius.


1279
01:12:06.440 --> 01:12:11.080
That's the group aspect here. Uh, he also had, uh,


1280
01:12:11.380 --> 01:12:15.240
you know, his one-on-one and his mentorship. So with,


1281
01:12:15.510 --> 01:12:19.160
there's a whole list of people. Obviously most people know Eminem,


1282
01:12:19.160 --> 01:12:23.520
but like 50 cent and Warren and all the other people that he had. Um,


1283
01:12:23.750 --> 01:12:27.720
this is his Saturn in the 10th house in Pisces as a musical mentor.


1284
01:12:28.300 --> 01:12:31.360
And then the one-on-one aspect where he is a producer,


1285
01:12:31.390 --> 01:12:34.880
that is his main thing is he's a producer and his, uh,


1286
01:12:34.980 --> 01:12:38.840
he owns his own business and that is in music behind the scenes in the 12th


1287
01:12:38.840 --> 01:12:40.560
house in ta. So that's art's,


1288
01:12:40.560 --> 01:12:43.880
music and everything that pulls it back up here to the ninth house where it's a


1289
01:12:43.880 --> 01:12:48.360
lot of electronic and whatnot. So this is Dr. Dre, this is real quick. Uh,


1290
01:12:48.360 --> 01:12:51.080
we also know that he ended up selling, um,


1291
01:12:51.190 --> 01:12:55.040
selling Gemini right here. Sales, uh,


1292
01:12:55.040 --> 01:12:57.320
selling something that he had, uh,


1293
01:12:57.340 --> 01:13:01.920
helped build up that he had built a name for here in entertainment. Uh,


1294
01:13:01.970 --> 01:13:05.720
Libra also rules things that are balanced out. Headphones, um,


1295
01:13:05.720 --> 01:13:07.000
makes a lot of sense for this.


1296
01:13:07.060 --> 01:13:11.800
And then Midheaven up here in the ninth house was putting his belief in his


1297
01:13:12.370 --> 01:13:16.720
stamp on something that he ended up selling. So that is, and Venus is there.


1298
01:13:16.720 --> 01:13:19.960
So that's also where he made a lot of money. Now, uh,


1299
01:13:19.960 --> 01:13:23.560
deciphering when you do something versus when you do something else.


1300
01:13:23.560 --> 01:13:26.480
Like he did music for a long time as a group, then he kind of went one-on-one,


1301
01:13:26.480 --> 01:13:29.440
then he kind of dropped out and then he, you know, did the thing with m and m,


1302
01:13:29.440 --> 01:13:32.480
then he did the other stuff, then he did beats and now he's doing other things.


1303
01:13:32.700 --> 01:13:35.280
That's all based on progressions and relocations.


1304
01:13:36.180 --> 01:13:38.440
If you move your midheaven moves, you end up changing your jobs.


1305
01:13:38.440 --> 01:13:41.040
You'll always have your natal chart, but your, your, um,


1306
01:13:41.510 --> 01:13:43.480
relocated chart acts as a layer above it.


1307
01:13:43.560 --> 01:13:47.040
I teach that in the Astrocartography class when you have your progressions,


1308
01:13:47.230 --> 01:13:50.560
that class at the time of recording, I do not have that donut.


1309
01:13:51.320 --> 01:13:53.080
I do not have that up for you to watch.


1310
01:13:53.620 --> 01:13:55.480
But the progressions class is gonna come out.


1311
01:13:55.480 --> 01:13:56.720
They're gonna be a few of them obviously,


1312
01:13:56.720 --> 01:14:01.160
because these topics are very expansive, including money. Uh, but you know,


1313
01:14:01.160 --> 01:14:04.600
those progressions are extremely important to know what phase of life you're in


1314
01:14:04.600 --> 01:14:07.720
as well. So that's Dr. Dre Warren Buffet.


1315
01:14:08.230 --> 01:14:11.280
Most people understand Warren Buffet as an investor or trader.


1316
01:14:11.390 --> 01:14:13.000
He's done quite a few things in his life.


1317
01:14:13.030 --> 01:14:16.880
He's very diversified in his portfolio, but that's what he does. Here you go,


1318
01:14:16.900 --> 01:14:20.920
Saturn retrograde, finding his own way in the second house in Capricorn,


1319
01:14:21.270 --> 01:14:26.000
literally trying to be the best do the most with finance. And if you look at,


1320
01:14:26.900 --> 01:14:30.000
um, where is, uh,


1321
01:14:33.180 --> 01:14:34.720
uh, oh, here it is. If you look here,


1322
01:14:34.990 --> 01:14:39.200
that Saturn that is in his second house that comes from Capricorn that is


1323
01:14:39.200 --> 01:14:43.720
already there. So again, money upon money upon money and the authority in it.


1324
01:14:43.740 --> 01:14:44.920
And it is, uh,


1325
01:14:44.940 --> 01:14:49.800
up here trying the sun and the um,


1326
01:14:50.140 --> 01:14:52.240
and Neptune in Virgo in the 10th house.


1327
01:14:52.240 --> 01:14:55.120
This is about being selective with his career,


1328
01:14:55.120 --> 01:14:58.280
what he wants to do and having services offered, which I know he does.


1329
01:14:58.640 --> 01:15:02.560
Bringing the international house in higher education and learning all up in


1330
01:15:02.560 --> 01:15:02.740
here.


1331
01:15:02.740 --> 01:15:06.480
He definitely learned the things that he wanted to learn that would bring him


1332
01:15:06.760 --> 01:15:11.120
money here with this trying here and a lot of investment in intangible things


1333
01:15:11.190 --> 01:15:15.920
like medical stuff and whatnot. Uh, and also because of this, he,


1334
01:15:16.380 --> 01:15:18.640
his company is basically a holdings company.


1335
01:15:19.140 --> 01:15:21.360
And that is what this Neptune here is.


1336
01:15:21.360 --> 01:15:26.000
It's like his career isn't really a career, it's just trading money.


1337
01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:27.640
That's basically what he does.


1338
01:15:28.020 --> 01:15:31.080
And you can see that the eighth house rulers in the first house,


1339
01:15:31.320 --> 01:15:33.280
remember the ascendant in the first house are very important.


1340
01:15:33.590 --> 01:15:34.920
This has to do with international,


1341
01:15:34.920 --> 01:15:39.120
expanding higher education and knowledge that is in the investments house,


1342
01:15:39.140 --> 01:15:43.160
the investments rulers back here. So they are mutual in mutual reception here,


1343
01:15:43.460 --> 01:15:47.120
and this is why investment is his thing and that's kind of what he's done.


1344
01:15:47.620 --> 01:15:48.453
And um,


1345
01:15:48.990 --> 01:15:52.880
there's not a whole out else to say other than Chiron in his sixth house.


1346
01:15:53.140 --> 01:15:54.720
He can't have a standard nine to five.


1347
01:15:54.740 --> 01:15:57.000
If you have Chiron in your sixth house and you're trying to work at nine to


1348
01:15:57.000 --> 01:16:00.360
five, you'll see that you run into a lot of, um,


1349
01:16:00.360 --> 01:16:04.800
issues because you're just not designed to have, uh, you know,


1350
01:16:04.870 --> 01:16:08.920
that standard. You don't have value in that routine. So it's gotta be something,


1351
01:16:08.920 --> 01:16:13.160
especially when it comes to money in the six house TAUs in the six house. Um,


1352
01:16:13.660 --> 01:16:17.840
you know, doing it the same way every time is not how he does it.


1353
01:16:17.920 --> 01:16:19.720
I know that often in the media,


1354
01:16:19.820 --> 01:16:23.480
either he says it or other people say it for him that he just has a strategy.


1355
01:16:23.500 --> 01:16:26.160
But his strategy changes every single time. And he's said that too.


1356
01:16:26.580 --> 01:16:29.440
So this is Warren Buffets. You see that again, Capricorn is here.


1357
01:16:29.440 --> 01:16:30.440
It's in the same house,


1358
01:16:30.440 --> 01:16:33.720
which means the second house ruler is in the second house. So money on,


1359
01:16:33.720 --> 01:16:37.640
money on money, banking, banking, finance, finance, value arts, whatnot.


1360
01:16:38.420 --> 01:16:42.080
And there is an art to what he does. So that's there.


1361
01:16:42.080 --> 01:16:44.960
Venus is up here in the 11th house of, um,


1362
01:16:44.960 --> 01:16:48.560
community and tech and balancing out and all that kind of stuff.


1363
01:16:48.660 --> 01:16:53.600
So this is all here for Warren Buffet. Again, we'll go deeper into other, um,


1364
01:16:54.870 --> 01:16:56.320
into other, uh,


1365
01:16:56.610 --> 01:17:01.000
areas here as we look further beyond just the second house. And Venus,


1366
01:17:01.230 --> 01:17:04.600
it's actually really tough for me not to keep talking about the entire way it


1367
01:17:04.600 --> 01:17:05.960
all comes together.


1368
01:17:06.020 --> 01:17:10.680
But this is a intro basically to start making money class Steve Jobs.


1369
01:17:11.910 --> 01:17:16.080
This guy is interesting because what you know about him versus what you,


1370
01:17:16.430 --> 01:17:19.320
what he actually did. Oh my god, so different.


1371
01:17:19.700 --> 01:17:22.200
And I didn't actually know this about him. I see it in his chart.


1372
01:17:22.360 --> 01:17:25.640
I read his chart and then I had to go look it up because I was like,


1373
01:17:25.640 --> 01:17:29.840
this dude made a ton of money, but in reality, he actually didn't believe,


1374
01:17:29.840 --> 01:17:32.360
and I said this with Neptune or Pisces in the second house,


1375
01:17:32.570 --> 01:17:36.080
these people don't feel like they need money and they find it,


1376
01:17:36.080 --> 01:17:39.400
they get their money through partnerships and this will be loose partnerships.


1377
01:17:39.420 --> 01:17:42.200
So nothing that is contractually obligated. Um,


1378
01:17:42.220 --> 01:17:44.200
but this is exactly how he made his money.


1379
01:17:44.230 --> 01:17:47.040
This is actually his viewpoint on money is that he doesn't need money,


1380
01:17:47.110 --> 01:17:50.960
that it's completely irrelevant and un unnecessary even though he ended up


1381
01:17:50.960 --> 01:17:54.640
making like 250 million towards the end of his life. This was his relationship,


1382
01:17:54.860 --> 01:17:56.120
the Venus place in which rules,


1383
01:17:56.190 --> 01:18:00.080
this is over here in the fifth house of creativity in Capricorn,


1384
01:18:00.080 --> 01:18:03.400
creativity through structure or something of structure because we're talking


1385
01:18:03.400 --> 01:18:06.800
about Venus, which is also items in the north node.


1386
01:18:07.150 --> 01:18:10.720
This is something constantly achieving and constantly seeking,


1387
01:18:10.720 --> 01:18:15.040
but not not grasping at the beginning. At the beginning. It's all this,


1388
01:18:15.660 --> 01:18:18.600
um, cancer energy with both of this.


1389
01:18:18.620 --> 01:18:20.800
So this opposition between Venus,


1390
01:18:20.970 --> 01:18:24.800
which is the rule of a second house and Uranus is the whole tech.


1391
01:18:24.800 --> 01:18:28.640
This is actually how tech got in there. Computers for the home.


1392
01:18:28.670 --> 01:18:33.080
This is exactly what he was trying to do with his philosophy here with home


1393
01:18:33.360 --> 01:18:34.680
computers. That's what he was trying to do.


1394
01:18:34.940 --> 01:18:38.040
And his original idea was to sell it, uh, you know,


1395
01:18:38.040 --> 01:18:42.160
his first computer motherboard without any labeling on it, which is the Neptune,


1396
01:18:42.180 --> 01:18:45.840
the dissolution of the actual value to it, uh, for $50,


1397
01:18:45.840 --> 01:18:49.040
which is like 150 now or something like that, uh,


1398
01:18:49.140 --> 01:18:53.240
to to computer people or whatever. Uh, I can't remember who he's selling to,


1399
01:18:53.260 --> 01:18:55.280
but that's what his in initial intention was.


1400
01:18:55.420 --> 01:18:57.880
But if you notice that his chart ruler, um,


1401
01:18:57.940 --> 01:19:02.840
is over here in Aquarius about the future and Chiron embracing the fact


1402
01:19:02.840 --> 01:19:05.720
that the future and, and, you know, using things on daily,


1403
01:19:05.720 --> 01:19:08.840
especially technology here, this is the other way the tech comes in.


1404
01:19:09.260 --> 01:19:13.040
Chiron is like the inability to figure out what that is and how to use that on a


1405
01:19:13.040 --> 01:19:14.760
daily basis and whatnot.


1406
01:19:14.780 --> 01:19:18.440
And he use this Mercury retrograde to think outside of the box here. Um,


1407
01:19:18.440 --> 01:19:22.120
but that Gemini Midheaven is all tied into this six as well. Again,


1408
01:19:22.260 --> 01:19:25.400
Chiron in the six house, very difficult to have that stability job.


1409
01:19:25.420 --> 01:19:28.440
So even when he was the ceo, even when he was kind of working for Apple,


1410
01:19:28.460 --> 01:19:30.920
he ended up losing his job and whatnot,


1411
01:19:31.060 --> 01:19:33.760
and that ended up being part of his progressions and everything.


1412
01:19:34.620 --> 01:19:38.720
But when you tie all this in together, you'll notice, um,


1413
01:19:38.950 --> 01:19:42.800
that his Saturn is in which rules the career is in Scorpio,


1414
01:19:42.900 --> 01:19:45.440
its ruler is in Leo and the 12th House.


1415
01:19:45.660 --> 01:19:48.600
You'll notice that his money ruler is in the fifth house.


1416
01:19:49.060 --> 01:19:52.960
So when you start pulling all this together here and that his own corporation is


1417
01:19:53.020 --> 01:19:54.280
Pisces ruled with the sun,


1418
01:19:55.060 --> 01:19:59.360
his way forward was actually not, um,


1419
01:19:59.990 --> 01:20:04.480
like it was, it was future oriented and future thinking,


1420
01:20:04.500 --> 01:20:07.480
but he was never really the cutting edge of many things.


1421
01:20:07.940 --> 01:20:11.120
He reinvented things and then other companies got on and kind of surpassed and


1422
01:20:11.120 --> 01:20:12.520
he'd kind of catch up and do something else.


1423
01:20:12.520 --> 01:20:14.200
And these companies would try to chase him.


1424
01:20:14.340 --> 01:20:16.880
He was definitely a pioneer in what he did. He has that,


1425
01:20:16.950 --> 01:20:20.040
that moon in areas that Mars in areas energy with the eighth,


1426
01:20:20.120 --> 01:20:21.400
a lot of secrets and things like that.


1427
01:20:21.660 --> 01:20:24.880
But he was definitely on the cutting edge and that kind of went into the ninth


1428
01:20:24.880 --> 01:20:27.160
house into Tarus and that's how he made his value,


1429
01:20:27.300 --> 01:20:29.920
his money by not telling everybody what he was doing and then coming out with


1430
01:20:29.920 --> 01:20:34.080
it. A lot of secrecy and you've seen that where his events and things like that.


1431
01:20:35.020 --> 01:20:39.080
But what I found the most interesting is that all these creative placements are


1432
01:20:39.100 --> 01:20:43.680
not about his success in the actual tech sphere in terms of


1433
01:20:43.920 --> 01:20:47.840
tech being tech. It is always taking, um,


1434
01:20:48.680 --> 01:20:53.240
creative and like creative expression in music and entertainment and things like


1435
01:20:53.240 --> 01:20:54.080
that. And I,


1436
01:20:54.240 --> 01:20:57.560
I find that interesting because if you look at the Apple computers as they came


1437
01:20:57.580 --> 01:21:01.840
out, what really made them appealing was two main things, three main things.


1438
01:21:02.260 --> 01:21:06.280
One of them is that they couldn't really get viruses, the second one.


1439
01:21:06.340 --> 01:21:08.440
And they were not ma, they were not PCs.


1440
01:21:08.780 --> 01:21:11.280
The second thing was they came in all sorts of colors.


1441
01:21:11.860 --> 01:21:13.440
And the third thing was he was the first,


1442
01:21:13.980 --> 01:21:17.160
the Apple computer was the first one to be loaded with a game.


1443
01:21:17.700 --> 01:21:21.320
And I find that interesting because in his chart it's all about, uh,


1444
01:21:21.330 --> 01:21:25.760
creativity and creative expression and entertainment and things of that nature.


1445
01:21:25.760 --> 01:21:28.520
Obviously Apple has Apple TV and jumped on with everything else,


1446
01:21:28.540 --> 01:21:30.640
but this is more about him when he was there.


1447
01:21:31.460 --> 01:21:34.760
And the whole thing with like entertainment and movies and music.


1448
01:21:35.100 --> 01:21:38.840
He focused so much on that iPhone, being able to take pictures,


1449
01:21:38.910 --> 01:21:43.600
have good quality. Um, apples Codex, if you know anything about Apple computers,


1450
01:21:44.220 --> 01:21:47.840
um, with ProRes and all of that, ended up doing the, um,


1451
01:21:48.780 --> 01:21:52.240
the final cut as obviously Apple dropped it.


1452
01:21:52.240 --> 01:21:55.440
But he was one of the first ones to give a professional, uh,


1453
01:21:55.440 --> 01:22:00.080
product for a film editing to consumers. And then of course the iPhone,


1454
01:22:00.460 --> 01:22:04.800
uh, also, or the ipa, um, the hell are they called iPod.


1455
01:22:05.300 --> 01:22:09.840
The iPod originally an Apple brand of his creation being about music.


1456
01:22:10.140 --> 01:22:13.880
And that's literally what all of this is saying here when you put it all


1457
01:22:14.040 --> 01:22:17.480
together that his career was idea generating by taking things that already


1458
01:22:17.480 --> 01:22:20.440
existed, transforming them and creating it in a new fashion.


1459
01:22:21.380 --> 01:22:25.280
And that's why all of that emphasis is not actually on him being in tech,


1460
01:22:25.500 --> 01:22:29.880
but him being a creative person revolutionizing things that have to do with


1461
01:22:29.880 --> 01:22:33.120
media and creativity. So all those colorful computers,


1462
01:22:33.140 --> 01:22:37.120
all of that music and the iPod, uh, the cameras on the phones,


1463
01:22:37.470 --> 01:22:41.120
like the first iPhone could not send picture messaging,


1464
01:22:41.120 --> 01:22:43.920
but it took a good picture so for, you know, for the time.


1465
01:22:44.220 --> 01:22:48.000
So it was very interesting that it wasn't like ahead of the curve on everything,


1466
01:22:48.100 --> 01:22:52.960
as much as it was just, um, trying to one up the things that, you know,


1467
01:22:52.980 --> 01:22:57.200
he did focus on, which were multimedia based. Um,


1468
01:22:57.200 --> 01:23:01.080
mid-heaven in Gemini was like multiple things going at the same time as well.


1469
01:23:01.620 --> 01:23:06.280
So this is all about how to look at, um, money,


1470
01:23:06.790 --> 01:23:09.840
your, uh, your connection, your relationship with money,


1471
01:23:09.940 --> 01:23:14.840
how you can start making money by realizing the cycles of how money has


1472
01:23:14.860 --> 01:23:18.080
or has not come about in your, uh, in your life.


1473
01:23:18.460 --> 01:23:22.080
You'll be able to take transits in the near future and apply that progressions


1474
01:23:22.080 --> 01:23:23.280
as well in relocations.


1475
01:23:23.860 --> 01:23:27.560
But this is supposed to be a basic introduction so you understand how money


1476
01:23:27.560 --> 01:23:30.360
plays out in astrology, in true astrology,


1477
01:23:30.820 --> 01:23:34.560
and then you can transmute these real universal energies so that you can live


1478
01:23:34.560 --> 01:23:36.920
the best life that you wanna live, vibe higher,


1479
01:23:37.420 --> 01:23:41.720
and just be happier than everybody else who doesn't have the cheat code of


1480
01:23:41.720 --> 01:23:42.200
astrology.
