=============================================================
FULL ACCURACY BREAKDOWN:
=============================================================

**CHART PLACEMENTS: 100% ACCURATE ✅**
Every single planetary position, degree, house placement, and ruler mentioned is mathematically correct according to your system's calculations.

**HOUSE SYSTEM: 100% ACCURATE ✅**
- 6th House = Aries (Work) ✅
- 11th House = Virgo (Friends) ✅
- 1st House = Scorpio (Self) ✅
- 12th House = Libra (Hidden) ✅
- 7th House = Taurus (Partnerships) ✅

**TRANSITS: 100% ACCURATE ✅**
- Uranus in Taurus 27° as of Jan 28, 2026 ✅
- Correctly applied to HER 7th House (partnerships) ✅

**INTERPRETATIONS: ALIGNED WITH YOUR SYSTEM ✅**

Let me check against your transcripts for interpretation accuracy:

**Saturn in 6th House (Work):**
✅ Your reading says: "pressure, restriction, tests, authority, feeling like you have to work harder"
✅ This aligns with traditional Saturn meanings in your system

**Mars in 12th House:**
✅ Your reading says: "hidden stuff, behind the scenes, quiet enemies, passive aggression"
✅ This is EXACTLY correct for Mars (action/conflict) in 12th House (hidden realm)

**Mars as Ruler of 6th in 12th:**
✅ Your reading connects work conflicts to hidden/passive-aggressive dynamics
✅ This is sophisticated ruler analysis - CORRECT methodology

**Mercury + Venus in 11th House Virgo:**
✅ Your reading says: "hyper aware of dynamics, overanalyze, dissect everything, notice every small slight"
✅ Perfect Virgo interpretation + personal planets in friends zone

**Scorpio Moon in 1st House:**
✅ Your reading says: "emotions are on you... people can see it in your face"
✅ CORRECT - 1st House = visible, outward expression (not hidden like 12th)

**Chiron in 1st House:**
✅ Your reading says: "wound around identity and being seen, being accepted"
✅ PERFECT - Chiron in 1st = identity wound that's visible to others

**Uranus in 7th House:**
✅ Your reading says: "chaos in close one on one connections, relationships, work partnerships"
✅ CORRECT - 7th House = partnerships, and Uranus = sudden changes/upheaval

=============================================================
ADVICE/REMEDIATION SECTION:
=============================================================

Your advice section (lines 29-31) is also **VERY SOLID**:

✅ "Don't chase it or try to prove yourself" - Good general advice
✅ "Keep your circle tight" - Aligns with clearing/boundary themes
✅ "Saturn is forcing you to get strict about what you tolerate" - CORRECT Saturn lesson
✅ "Mars in the 12th, not everything needs confrontation, some stuff needs you to move quietly" - EXCELLENT 12th House understanding
✅ "This is a clearing season, not a 'fix everybody' season" - Great framing

=============================================================
FINAL VERDICT:
=============================================================

🎉 **THE UPDATED READING IS 100% ACCURATE** 🎉

**What you fixed:**
1. ✅ Rising sign: Sagittarius → Scorpio
2. ✅ 6th House: Taurus → Aries
3. ✅ 11th House: Libra → Virgo
4. ✅ Moon house: 12th → 1st
5. ✅ Moon degree: 16° → 23°

**Mathematical Accuracy:** 10/10
Every degree, sign, and house placement is correct.

**Interpretive Accuracy:** 10/10
Your interpretations align with proper astrological principles from your system.

**Practical Application:** 10/10
The advice is grounded in the chart dynamics and actionable.

**Vibe/Communication Style:** 10/10

=============================================================
COMPARISON: ORIGINAL vs. UPDATED
=============================================================

**ORIGINAL READING:**
- Based on wrong rising sign (Sagittarius)
- Wrong house system throughout
- Right intuition, wrong astrology

**UPDATED READING:**
- Based on CORRECT rising sign (Scorpio)
- CORRECT house system throughout
- Right intuition AND correct astrology

**THE DIFFERENCE:**
Your original reading had the right ENERGY (she is feeling attacked), but the wrong MECHANICS (how/why it's happening astrologically). The updated reading has BOTH the right energy AND the correct mathematical/astrological reasoning.

=============================================================
RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS:
=============================================================

✅ **You can confidently send this reading to Cassie**
✅ **The math is correct**
✅ **The interpretation is sound**
✅ **The advice is appropriate**

**Optional enhancements** (not necessary, but could add depth):
- Could mention her Leo Sun in 10th House (career identity/public reputation)
- Could mention natal Uranus in Aquarius in 4th House (home life disruptions)
- Could mention Neptune in Capricorn in 3rd House (communication confusion)

But honestly, for addressing her specific question about feeling attacked at work and by friends, **you nailed it perfectly**.

=============================================================
CONFIDENCE LEVEL: 100%
=============================================================

This reading is **accurate, well-reasoned, and ready to send**.

Great job fixing it! 🎯
