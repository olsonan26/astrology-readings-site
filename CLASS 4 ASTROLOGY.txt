3
00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:10.100
you've taken classes one two, and three then this is all going to


4
00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:13.400
make sense. If you're trying to dive into class four without having taken my


5
00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.400
first three classes. You may feel a bit lost to make sure you've taken


6
00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.200
those classes first. This is the tying it


7
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:23.000
together class or tying it all together. However, I finally worded


8
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.700
I guess I type tying it together. So that's what it is. This


9
00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:29.400
is taking all the things we've talked about in this manifestation astrology


10
00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:32.300
class course rather from Step


11
00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.300
Zero really to


12
00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:35.000
a hundred.


13
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.200
And I can't even speak zero to 105 classes. That was


14
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.200
the whole goal of this thing for people who were beginners or didn't know


15
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:46.100
much about or anything about astrology to be able to get to manifestation and


16
00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:48.200
using astrology for their purposes without having


17
00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:49.500
to dive into all the details.


18
00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.900
That are what I would consider extraneous. So we've


19
00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:56.700
done one two, and three here's four. This is exciting because


20
00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:59.600
this is the first class that has no class materials. It is


21
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.400
literally me. I have a sticky on


22
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:05.400
the screen. It says tying it together. It's not as put together or


23
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.300
polished looking as the other ones but it's because this is


24
00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:11.300
the first class where you don't need all that extra stuff. We're gonna


25
00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:14.600
look at three charts today. I've chosen three random


26
00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.400
times. Birth dates birthplace is


27
00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.700
what not and we're gonna analyze them we're gonna go through and we're


28
00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.300
going to figure out you know, what we can decode from


29
00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.700
these people based off of or imaginary People based


30
00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.200
off of everything that we have learned before and see


31
00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.300
if we can put together a fictitious person. Who are they


32
00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:36.500
what are their parents like what type of relationships if they have siblings what


33
00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:37.200
they have with them?


34
00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.300
What's their Public Image and things like that the fifth class which


35
00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:44.300
is the next one is the manifestation class. So hopefully


36
00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.300
you'll watch this one as many times you need you'll learn


37
00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:50.600
what you need from this class to take it forward and be


38
00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.300
able to actually manifest that's going to be a fun class too


39
00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:56.100
because we'll be taking energies and talking about


40
00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.300
the polarities of those energies and how you can make things


41
00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:01.800
work for yourself including a little bit with transits.


42
00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:03.800
So with this class here.


43
00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.500
What I want to start out with is again. I have no physical,


44
00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.300
you know anything to look at in terms


45
00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:13.600
of materials, but I


46
00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.200
want you to think abstractly for


47
00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.200
a moment. What's most important about my system and


48
00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.500
what I'm teaching you here and why I differ from almost every other


49
00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.500
astrology out there is in my system. I devise something


50
00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.200
that I call lenses and lenses are a


51
00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.400
filter that you put over mentally over the entire chart.


52
00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.300
That help you read a chart in a


53
00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:38.100
very specific Manner and avoiding all of the


54
00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:41.100
extraneous nonsense and the noise that has


55
00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:44.000
nothing to do with what answer you're trying to


56
00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.300
achieve out of the chart. What do I mean by that? Well, when we


57
00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:51.000
look at somebody's chart and I'm just going to pull up the first one here. Boom.


58
00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:51.600
There it is.


59
00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:53.700
The first chart here.


60
00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:58.700
Is this is my Rebel Academy sample one that


61
00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:01.600
we're seeing here and this person's


62
00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:02.100
chart.


63
00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.500
I put in that they're born December 2nd of 1981. I


64
00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:09.100
was close to my birthday at 1:30 in the


65
00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:12.700
morning and I chose a city in Mississippi. So this


66
00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:15.400
person here is a Libra rising


67
00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.400
and then the planets fell where they were now


68
00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.200
every energy that you see here and I'm


69
00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.100
not talking about progressions or transits or relocations or


70
00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:27.100
anything like that solar Arc solar returns Saturn return.


71
00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:30.800
I'm not talking about anything but they're natal energy. This


72
00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:32.800
is the natal energy for this person.


73
00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:37.700
When you when you look at a chart like this if you


74
00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:38.900
have not honed in.


75
00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:42.200
What it is you're looking for you are


76
00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:45.700
not going to find any answers and this is what I think can be


77
00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:48.400
very difficult when learning astrology is you


78
00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:51.400
will pull up your natal chart. Let's assume this was yours and you'll


79
00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:55.000
start piecing it together fragmented, you know


80
00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:58.600
by doing Google searches and trying to figure out what each one of these, you


81
00:03:58.600 --> 00:03:59.900
know positions means and


82
00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:04.400
You do have to fragment it at first, right? There's no way to kind of pull it


83
00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:07.900
all together. That's what this class is teaching you but you're you


84
00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:10.500
know, you're Googling or you're learning. You're like, okay the midheaven means


85
00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:13.200
this cancer means this the tenth house means


86
00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:13.900
this, okay.


87
00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:18.500
Pluto means this Pluto in the first house Pluto in


88
00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:21.300
Libra means this. Okay Saturn's there


89
00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:24.300
as well. Now in the previous classes, we talked about a


90
00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:28.200
couple of more advanced things intermediate to Advanced things like stelliums


91
00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:30.600
and satellitiums. I'm going to refresh for


92
00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:33.200
anybody who doesn't remember a stellium is a


93
00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:36.800
grouping of planets that are within the same


94
00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:39.300
house and sign that are within


95
00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:42.400
an orb of influence of each other. Now, I


96
00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:45.400
take stelliums outside of the plate the sign


97
00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:48.300
and house because I


98
00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:51.200
believe that those energy still work together and they still


99
00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:54.500
matter you just have to then dive deeper into the science


100
00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:57.800
and houses that you're talking about when you start getting into the details of


101
00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:57.900
it.


102
00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:01.300
But the actual definition the same sign in house.


103
00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:05.400
A satellitium is a bunch of planets that


104
00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:08.400
are in the same sign in house, but they are not within each


105
00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:11.400
other's orb of influence meaning they're not close enough to actually


106
00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:14.500
influence each other. It is important to understand that


107
00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:17.200
a stellium creates its own set of


108
00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:20.100
energies and a satellitium Works within the


109
00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:23.400
same house and sign and affects the same theme as


110
00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:24.500
opposed to affecting each other.


111
00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:26.900
So that's the difference between those.


112
00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:31.100
I also want to talk about the fact that.


113
00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:34.100
When you're looking at any.


114
00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:38.300
Any chart your own and you're trying to put all this together that all


115
00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:42.600
the aspects all of the the rulership's


116
00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:44.900
and the reverse or the bi-directionality of


117
00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:47.500
rulerships, right? We talked about that when the previous classes. So


118
00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:50.100
if I look at this person's Mars placement, it's in


119
00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:53.200
the 12th house in Virgo. We know that the ruler of Virgo is


120
00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:56.600
mercury I need to know where Mercury is and how it's aspected


121
00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:59.500
in a situated to know how that 12th house actually plays and


122
00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:01.400
thus how Mars plays out.


123
00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:05.700
Because we're talking about Mars. I also need to know about Aries because


124
00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:08.500
Mars rules Aries. So I go the opposite direction


125
00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:11.300
go find the Aries glyph and I


126
00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:14.400
look here to see if there's anything going on. Now. This is pretty simple because


127
00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:17.200
this person has nothing in the seventh house.


128
00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:18.600
and again


129
00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:22.000
I can't remember if I talked about this in the first three so I'll say


130
00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:25.400
it here. I say don't tiktok in YouTube videos all


131
00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:28.400
the time, but empty houses are not really empty houses.


132
00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:31.500
Empty houses. Just mean that your energy is


133
00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:34.100
not focused in that area of life. It does not


134
00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:38.300
mean that nothing happens in that area of life. In fact, this imaginary


135
00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:41.600
person could have an extremely


136
00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:44.000
active romantic life


137
00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:46.900
if it's ruler is also aspecting other


138
00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:49.500
things because the rulership is far more


139
00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:51.900
important than the placements there in my opinion.


140
00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:55.200
So now that we have all of that we're looking at


141
00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:58.300
these energies and you're probably of one of two


142
00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:01.200
mindsets. The first mindset is there's not a


143
00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:04.600
lot going on in this chart once I know what Chiron means that's all


144
00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:07.400
I need to know once I know what Jupiter means that's why


145
00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:10.600
I need to know if you're of that mindset. Maybe you need to revisit classes


146
00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:13.600
one two, and three again because it's so


147
00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:16.400
much more complex and involved than just the


148
00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:17.900
simple placement here.


149
00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:21.600
Even once you include orbs of influence knowing that


150
00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:24.100
Jupiter reaches Pluto Pluto doesn't reach Jupiter that


151
00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:27.400
kind of thing that's more of an advanced technique but these two are impacting


152
00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:30.300
there's a togetherness of that energy here across the


153
00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:34.200
cuspline that's important or you're of


154
00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:36.200
the other mentality of saying this


155
00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:39.300
is a lot of information. How do we possibly decipher this


156
00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:42.100
into any sort of question because there's just always something going on.


157
00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:46.300
In every area of the chart. How do we pull it


158
00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:47.800
all together and look at it the same right?


159
00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:51.400
And I've seen both people or both situations play out


160
00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:54.200
amongst people where it's either. There's not enough


161
00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:57.200
information here. I actually see that a lot more than I thought I would


162
00:07:57.200 --> 00:08:00.200
there's not a lot here to tell so usually it's because they


163
00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:03.200
don't dive deep enough, right and in the previous classes we talked


164
00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:06.400
about that or like I said, it's like there's too many planets. There's too


165
00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:06.700
much math.


166
00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:10.300
How do I know especially when we start getting into the aspects down here?


167
00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:14.300
How do I know that all of


168
00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:17.300
these you know, how all these are going to impact each other,


169
00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:17.800
right?


170
00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:21.900
So again, this is called lenses lenses


171
00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:24.200
are choosing the topic. Now the


172
00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:27.000
easiest thing to do the hardest thing to do. Let me say


173
00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:30.900
that first the hardest thing to do is to do what's called a natal chart report reading,


174
00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:33.200
right? This is everybody asks for


175
00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:36.000
this because they want to know everything about themselves, but I've been doing


176
00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:40.000
astrology for like six or seven years now obsessively and


177
00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:42.300
I'm still finding new things in my chart because it's


178
00:08:42.300 --> 00:08:45.600
impossible to go through every single aspect in


179
00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:48.400
every area of life in every situation that could


180
00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:51.900
occur based off of Just One


181
00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:54.100
Reading especially when these people expect it in 45


182
00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:57.400
minutes. It's just not gonna happen. I can spend 45 minutes on


183
00:08:57.400 --> 00:08:59.800
your first house and still not get done.


184
00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:04.600
You have to take a look at all of this plus if


185
00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:07.400
I'm actually doing a report reading for you and your


186
00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:09.000
let's say you're 33 years old.


187
00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:12.300
You know, I've got a I got


188
00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:15.400
to look at progressions. Have you moved I got to look at your relocations, like


189
00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:18.400
it gets very very in-depth. We are complex individuals. So


190
00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:19.700
it makes sense.


191
00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:23.700
So I don't do those like hardly


192
00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:26.800
ever and when I do I charge a lot more and I


193
00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:29.700
would advise the same for everybody else because you are diving so


194
00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:32.800
deep into so many areas and you're still not giving enough information


195
00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:35.100
that people are going to be satisfied. There's always going


196
00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:38.200
to be questions at the end. Now the easiest way to do it, which is


197
00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:41.600
the way I prefer is you ask me a question and I'll


198
00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:44.400
answer it. So when you're doing your astrology readings, even


199
00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:47.600
if you're doing them for yourself, ask the question, what


200
00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:50.100
is the question that we're talking about? Is it love is


201
00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:53.600
it money career finances life purpose friends home


202
00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:56.300
family intimacy travel. What is


203
00:09:56.300 --> 00:09:59.300
the question you can there's a million questions. You can ask some of


204
00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:02.200
them require transits, which we're not going to talk about today. Some of


205
00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:05.400
them don't some of them just have to do with your personality. Why am


206
00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:08.300
I always having problems in love? Why I can't I find my career. What


207
00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:12.200
type of career best suits me. How do I make money? Why do


208
00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:15.300
I feel so down all the time? Those are easy questions to answer?


209
00:10:16.300 --> 00:10:19.400
If you don't know how to read this chart, it's clearly not easy. But


210
00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:22.100
once you do which is the whole point of this class and when I'm hoping


211
00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:25.500
you guys gather out of by the end of this class, it will become


212
00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:28.300
much easier so lenses, right? So


213
00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:31.800
we're gonna pick a topic for this person the first


214
00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:34.300
person. Well, you know, I'll just I'll just pick one for


215
00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:37.400
you because the main ones are loving career, right? So we'll just do love and career


216
00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:40.500
for both of these home life


217
00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:42.800
or we'll pick something random if somebody has a question, so


218
00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:46.500
For this random person here. We'll


219
00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:49.200
talk about career first, right? Because it's it's one of


220
00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:52.800
the main things now on top of career. We have to understand that


221
00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:55.500
topics are always actually know


222
00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:56.000
we start with love.


223
00:10:56.900 --> 00:11:00.000
Because I wrote Love on my little note over there love and


224
00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:02.400
then we'll do career every topic


225
00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:05.400
that you do every single one is broken into


226
00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:08.500
sub parts. Everything in the world is


227
00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:11.300
broken down into further things that are broken down in a further


228
00:11:11.300 --> 00:11:14.100
things. Your body is broken down into cells your cells


229
00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:17.300
are broken down and atoms your atoms, you know, he keeps going down and down and


230
00:11:17.300 --> 00:11:20.700
down until you can't break it down anymore. So once we get down to deckons and


231
00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:21.000
dwads


232
00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:24.400
You know, there's not much further we can go than we


233
00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:28.100
got dive into rulerships and we add in all the other pieces. So what


234
00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:28.700
do I mean by that?


235
00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:31.100
with this with love


236
00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:34.900
most people most astrologers most tiktok videos


237
00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:38.200
Google searches anything that you find will always say


238
00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:41.100
that love is based off of the seventh house and then


239
00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:43.100
they leave it at that and you're like


240
00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:48.300
Well, what if I have an empty seventh house and even


241
00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:51.300
if I tell you you have rulership's you're like, okay. Well, I've got a ruler


242
00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:52.800
and that's not aspecting anything.


243
00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:56.500
Okay. So now you you are left


244
00:11:56.500 --> 00:11:59.500
with a a client a quarant or yourself. If


245
00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:02.700
you're asked if you're trying to figure this out in your own chart that feels


246
00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:06.100
lost and roadblocked and just


247
00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:08.200
you know that you hit a wall. It's like there are no answers


248
00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:09.500
and it's just not true.


249
00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:12.100
There are so many answers that are in here. So.


250
00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:16.600
Love relationships, you know from the previous


251
00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:20.100
classes that the seventh house does represent your relationships.


252
00:12:19.100 --> 00:12:22.900
It represents your one to one interactions. It


253
00:12:22.900 --> 00:12:26.300
represents your first marriage. However, love


254
00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:28.500
is a very abstract term. What


255
00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:31.300
does Love Actually mean well love is


256
00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:34.900
an emotion. It is something you


257
00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:37.900
feel for something or someone right?


258
00:12:37.900 --> 00:12:40.500
It can be difficult to describe. But


259
00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:43.200
if you break it down astrologically every single one


260
00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:46.400
of these placements every single one of these houses has to


261
00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:47.100
do with love.


262
00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:50.600
So when I hear people constantly say the seventh


263
00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:53.600
house is love and they leave it at that. It really bugs me


264
00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:56.300
because it's not just that you've got 11 other


265
00:12:56.300 --> 00:12:59.500
houses that have to do with Love on different levels, right?


266
00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:03.100
So you have your seventh house again, this is your


267
00:13:03.100 --> 00:13:06.300
romantic partner and your one-to-one interactions. But what


268
00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:09.400
about romance romance is a Leo trait


269
00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:12.100
romance falls under the fifth house here and I'm


270
00:13:12.100 --> 00:13:15.200
just going to do the houses first because then you look at the science and you


271
00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:18.500
look at the planets to Triple up on all of these. So you


272
00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:22.000
start looking at the fifth house. How does this hand person handle


273
00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:24.400
romance romance is puppy love.


274
00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:27.400
It's the first stage. It's taking the risk. It's you know,


275
00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:30.700
all the the good stuff the fun stuff the pride the


276
00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:34.100
feeling good part of love. It is the intro to


277
00:13:33.100 --> 00:13:36.800
love. It's baby love baby. Love is


278
00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:38.000
fifth house.


279
00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:40.000
intimacy


280
00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:43.100
intimacy is a complete different level. You don't


281
00:13:43.100 --> 00:13:47.000
get intimate with random romantic Partners you get


282
00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:50.000
intimate with people that you trust intimacy comes


283
00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:51.700
after the engagement with people.


284
00:13:52.700 --> 00:13:55.600
Intimacy is the Eighth House Eighth House


285
00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:58.900
has to do a secrets and deep bonds. But in love right


286
00:13:58.900 --> 00:14:01.400
we're taking everything out except the


287
00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:04.600
lens of love in the lens of Love The


288
00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:07.500
Eighth House deep bonds translates to


289
00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:08.300
intimacy.


290
00:14:09.300 --> 00:14:12.200
The ninth house has to do with expansion and Journeys and


291
00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:15.300
travel. So this is where your playful with your partner.


292
00:14:15.300 --> 00:14:19.000
It's the what ifs it's the Fantastical scenarios that


293
00:14:18.100 --> 00:14:21.100
you have with your partner. And if you


294
00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:24.100
were to partner when you partner with somebody, how do


295
00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:27.700
you want to travel? How do you explore within your love language?


296
00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:30.600
That's here. How do you speak in terms


297
00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:33.400
of Love third house? How do you feel safe


298
00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:34.400
forth house?


299
00:14:35.700 --> 00:14:38.100
How do you like to be in public with your


300
00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:39.900
partner tenth house?


301
00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:43.900
How are you outside of your your partnership?


302
00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:46.000
How do you need to interact? What do you


303
00:14:46.100 --> 00:14:49.500
need to salvage within your relationship? It


304
00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:52.400
opposes the seventh house. This is you this is


305
00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:55.700
your solo Endeavors. This is what's important for you to maintain your


306
00:14:55.700 --> 00:14:58.900
individuality within love hopes and


307
00:14:58.900 --> 00:15:01.500
dreams anything that goes on beyond Behind the


308
00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:04.200
Scenes music spirituality within the


309
00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:07.500
context of love your values in love.


310
00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:12.000
Right and it continues on six House of B your


311
00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:14.700
own health. But also how you serve your partner would


312
00:15:14.700 --> 00:15:17.300
be here. I think I hit all the houses. So when you're looking


313
00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:20.500
at it in the context of love all the themes of the houses stay


314
00:15:20.500 --> 00:15:23.200
exactly the same, but you have to dwindle them down into


315
00:15:24.300 --> 00:15:25.800
And chisel out carve out.


316
00:15:27.700 --> 00:15:30.400
Your topic and if it's love it's that's what


317
00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:33.400
it is when we get to Career. It's something completely different. So


318
00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:36.800
for this person Rebel Academy sample one


319
00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:39.300
this person here


320
00:15:39.300 --> 00:15:42.500
in love. We take a look at the seventh house. We always


321
00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:45.200
start with the seventh house to put it all together. We always have to have


322
00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:48.200
a starting point and ironically enough. I


323
00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:50.600
think I pretty much consistently start.


324
00:15:51.700 --> 00:15:54.500
With the thing that is the pop culture reference, right?


325
00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:57.300
So everybody says love is the seventh house and I actually do start


326
00:15:57.300 --> 00:16:01.000
at the seventh house. So look at the seventh house. This is the first marriage if


327
00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:03.100
they say they've been married and divorce and are


328
00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:06.200
looking for a second partner. I take a look at the seventh house and


329
00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:09.100
then I go straight to the ninth house because the seventh house is the


330
00:16:09.100 --> 00:16:12.400
relationships. That is the undertone but the ninth house


331
00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:15.500
is really how I'm going to find the traits qualities and


332
00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:18.200
relationship that they're going to have with the next person. What does that


333
00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:19.200
person need to embody?


334
00:16:20.300 --> 00:16:23.000
And that fits the second marriage and they're going to the third one. Here's the


335
00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:26.700
third one same thing and each marriage is going to be different except


336
00:16:26.700 --> 00:16:29.400
that there's going to be the undertone of always


337
00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:32.200
the seventh house in terms of how they interact with people because that's


338
00:16:32.900 --> 00:16:33.800
that's their basis.


339
00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:37.100
It is the opposite of their solo act it is how


340
00:16:37.100 --> 00:16:38.300
they interact outwardly.


341
00:16:39.100 --> 00:16:40.100
so for this person


342
00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:44.600
their relationships is empty right empty


343
00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:47.300
house, but we know empty house doesn't really mean empty house. But


344
00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:51.000
here it means that there's not a lot of focus put onto their


345
00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:53.100
relationships in terms of love. I don't


346
00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:56.200
care about starting their own business, which is also the seventh house.


347
00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:59.400
I don't care about interacting with the the public that it's


348
00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:02.600
also the seventh house. I don't care about their legal matters. That's


349
00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:05.700
also the seventh house. All I care about is love and


350
00:17:05.700 --> 00:17:08.400
in terms of the seventh house and love


351
00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:12.500
and the lens it is the one-to-one relationship romantically,


352
00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:14.400
right? No business partners. Nothing


353
00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:17.300
else just romance or not


354
00:17:17.300 --> 00:17:21.300
Romance the love connection the love interaction Romance


355
00:17:20.300 --> 00:17:21.900
the fifth house.


356
00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:24.600
in the seventh house their first marriage and


357
00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:27.600
just a male or female. I'm pretty sure it's a female.


358
00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:31.200
that I put in there not that it matters doesn't really change much


359
00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:31.300
but


360
00:17:33.900 --> 00:17:37.500
Empty house. I gotta go to the rulership Aries


361
00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:39.200
Mars Mars in Twelfth house.


362
00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:42.500
This means that this person's relationships are probably because


363
00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:45.600
energy does resonate at its lowest vibration. This


364
00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:48.200
is why I can get so accurate with most people most of the time.


365
00:17:49.100 --> 00:17:52.200
Is because energy will play out the way that it normally plays


366
00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:54.300
out at its lowest frequency setting.


367
00:17:55.800 --> 00:17:58.600
99% of the time unless somebody is changing something


368
00:17:58.600 --> 00:18:01.500
but most people don't know anything about astrology and


369
00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:04.800
that's what makes predictions a bit easier these days until


370
00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:07.800
I teach you all how to do this and you're actually manifesting


371
00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:10.200
with it. Then it's not as easy. I know it'll stay


372
00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:14.000
within the scope because you can only use the energy that you have to use but


373
00:18:13.300 --> 00:18:16.300
then you'll be changing things. So I hope to get


374
00:18:16.300 --> 00:18:18.200
to that point. I hope it gets harder to read people.


375
00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:21.600
But anyway, that's that's what happened. So.


376
00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:22.800
basically


377
00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:27.400
relationships are always put on the back burner. This person


378
00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:29.600
would be hypercritical of their partner.


379
00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:33.500
And their service to their partner because


380
00:18:33.500 --> 00:18:36.100
we're talking about Virgo's energy would be


381
00:18:36.100 --> 00:18:39.200
kind of non-existent. They would not want to


382
00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:42.600
serve their partner. Now. That's the lowest vibration.


383
00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:45.300
The highest vibration is if they had a good relationship with them


384
00:18:45.300 --> 00:18:47.300
is that we still look at the same energy.


385
00:18:48.300 --> 00:18:51.600
And we go over here and they would


386
00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:52.800
have a spiritual connection.


387
00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:56.800
With this person, that would be very healthy


388
00:18:56.800 --> 00:18:59.300
and then we zoom in and we look at the deck in


389
00:18:59.300 --> 00:19:02.200
here and that is in the Taurus deck in so there would


390
00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:06.000
be value within the service spiritually speaking


391
00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:07.400
with this person.


392
00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:12.400
I hope that makes sense the toughest part about teaching this


393
00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:15.100
course is I don't have anybody to be like nodding back


394
00:19:15.100 --> 00:19:17.000
to me. So I'm just gonna keep going here.


395
00:19:17.900 --> 00:19:20.300
So we know the energy we know the house


396
00:19:20.300 --> 00:19:23.300
and we know the placement so that is their relationship


397
00:19:23.300 --> 00:19:27.400
that is their first relationship and to


398
00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:31.000
dive deeper because we talked about layering.


399
00:19:31.700 --> 00:19:34.500
I know that the seventh house the first marriage, I know


400
00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:38.100
that it's energy is in the 12th house. That's basically


401
00:19:37.100 --> 00:19:40.700
all you have to look at at the beginning the energy


402
00:19:40.700 --> 00:19:41.600
of the relationship.


403
00:19:42.700 --> 00:19:45.800
Is an Aries so there could be themes of


404
00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:50.100
competition. There could be themes of arguing


405
00:19:48.100 --> 00:19:52.100
there could be passion or


406
00:19:51.100 --> 00:19:54.300
a lot of passion this person may jump into


407
00:19:54.300 --> 00:19:55.600
relationships quickly.


408
00:19:56.500 --> 00:19:59.100
And potentially dissolve them just as quickly.


409
00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:06.000
they could be attracted to people of Aries qualities, which could be


410
00:20:07.900 --> 00:20:10.500
You know celebrities people who


411
00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:13.600
work in law enforcement or military or you know


412
00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:16.600
firefighters of that kind of nature athletes.


413
00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:22.200
Anyone who has more of a dominant masculine Aries


414
00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:24.400
Martian type of vibe would be


415
00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:24.800
this person.


416
00:20:26.300 --> 00:20:29.300
Now that energy is all put here there also needs to be a


417
00:20:29.300 --> 00:20:32.000
shyness a reservation to these people.


418
00:20:32.900 --> 00:20:35.200
Right because we're taking all that seventh energy


419
00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:37.800
and we're throwing it into the 12th house. That's where the ruler is.


420
00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:41.300
So we're looking at at Mars here and that's


421
00:20:41.300 --> 00:20:42.800
in the 12th house in Virgo.


422
00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:46.800
This is where the critical being critical of their partner and


423
00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:49.200
being service spiritually behind the


424
00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:51.000
scenes service. So if they are.


425
00:20:52.300 --> 00:20:55.500
You know if they are of service to their


426
00:20:55.500 --> 00:20:58.600
partner like to do things for the partner spend time with their partner, no


427
00:20:58.600 --> 00:21:01.300
one really knows that it sits in the 12th house.


428
00:21:01.300 --> 00:21:03.900
It's not something they put out publicly. It's a very private thing.


429
00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:07.400
Very behind the scenes here, especially with value


430
00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:08.000
and worth.


431
00:21:09.700 --> 00:21:12.100
This energy if we want to understand the 12th house


432
00:21:12.100 --> 00:21:15.200
a bit more. We need to know the ruler of Virgo. That is


433
00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:17.200
Mercury Mercury is sitting


434
00:21:18.100 --> 00:21:20.800
Quick Glance just tells me that it's sitting in the third house.


435
00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:24.900
so we're actually diving deeper into here and we're


436
00:21:24.900 --> 00:21:28.200
saying okay this person's relationship with


437
00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:32.000
other people behind the scenes start/stops and


438
00:21:31.300 --> 00:21:35.000
hypercritical doesn't really


439
00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:37.100
tell anybody about it, especially since the


440
00:21:37.100 --> 00:21:40.600
communication here is in Sagittarius


441
00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:41.500
now the issue is


442
00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:44.500
If they try not to tell people.


443
00:21:45.700 --> 00:21:48.500
Because it's ruler is in the third house.


444
00:21:49.300 --> 00:21:52.200
And all these other energies I'm gonna break it down


445
00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:55.500
for you. But basically this much energy here


446
00:21:55.500 --> 00:21:58.800
in the third house in Sagittarius tells


447
00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:01.800
me that it doesn't matter how private they


448
00:22:01.800 --> 00:22:02.900
try to keep this relationship.


449
00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:07.200
It will never be private. It will be talked about


450
00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:12.300
it will be communicated worldwide through cultures published


451
00:22:10.300 --> 00:22:12.800
even.


452
00:22:14.100 --> 00:22:18.500
At the sun is all about Leo. So entertainment publishing mercury


453
00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:20.300
has to do with this communication. So


454
00:22:20.300 --> 00:22:24.100
that's radio. That's even here is Media music


455
00:22:23.100 --> 00:22:25.100
news?


456
00:22:26.100 --> 00:22:29.500
And then we have Uranus here. So that's even through friends.


457
00:22:29.500 --> 00:22:32.200
So this type of energy here is like


458
00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:35.500
friends are trying to keep a secret but they're not really they're


459
00:22:35.500 --> 00:22:38.600
like talking a bit too much and it's supposed to be secret, but


460
00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:40.400
it's you know, it's not


461
00:22:41.700 --> 00:22:45.400
So this person has a really hard time keeping their


462
00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:47.200
relationships Secret.


463
00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:51.200
And that's really all they wanted to do because that's the energy


464
00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:54.100
here as they try to keep everything behind the scenes, but it doesn't work that way.


465
00:22:55.100 --> 00:22:58.200
So in order to analyze that even further like I said when you


466
00:22:58.200 --> 00:23:01.500
have stelliums and/or satellitiums here, you got all this energy. Now


467
00:23:01.500 --> 00:23:04.200
a couple of these we don't have to worry about right now. I'm going


468
00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:07.700
to ignore Juno for this class. I'm going to ignore Lilith. I'm


469
00:23:07.700 --> 00:23:10.400
just going to pay attention to the main planets, which are these four?


470
00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:14.400
We have zero five 10 and 24. So it's


471
00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:17.400
technically satellitium with a conjunction in the middle from the


472
00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:20.700
Sun back to Mercury. So if


473
00:23:20.700 --> 00:23:23.300
I want to understand the relationships and how


474
00:23:23.300 --> 00:23:25.200
it's getting out, I look here at


475
00:23:28.500 --> 00:23:32.200
Neptune brain fart Neptune Neptune


476
00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:34.100
is the ruler of what the sixth house


477
00:23:34.100 --> 00:23:34.900
of Pisces here.


478
00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:38.700
So when I look here it has to do with work work


479
00:23:38.700 --> 00:23:41.800
and health and daily routine is


480
00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:42.600
being talked about.


481
00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:47.200
The sun whereas Leo Leo is up


482
00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:51.000
here hopes dreams networking friends internet


483
00:23:50.700 --> 00:23:53.200
technology. These are all the themes of the


484
00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:56.800
11th house in an Entertainment form creative expression


485
00:23:56.800 --> 00:23:59.100
or children. That's all going to be


486
00:23:59.100 --> 00:24:00.100
talked about as well.


487
00:24:00.900 --> 00:24:03.800
And it doesn't matter how much within the relationships the


488
00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:06.400
one-on-one interactions and the romance this will always


489
00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:07.600
be spoken of


490
00:24:08.300 --> 00:24:11.700
Mercury we already know is the rule here, but it's a double ruler. So


491
00:24:11.700 --> 00:24:15.200
it's also the ninth house. So whenever this person travels even


492
00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:17.600
short distances because it's Gemini


493
00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:20.300
energy when this person travels when this person has a


494
00:24:20.300 --> 00:24:23.200
thought or philosophy or publishes anything it is talked about


495
00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:27.200
a lot as well. And then Uranus here is the


496
00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:29.300
fifth house again children and more


497
00:24:29.300 --> 00:24:31.300
specifically because the Moon is there.


498
00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:34.100
Her as a mother with her children.


499
00:24:35.500 --> 00:24:37.600
Now I'm breaking it down as slow as possible.


500
00:24:38.600 --> 00:24:41.800
I'm doing my best by the way, I think very fast.


501
00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:44.700
I've shown you guys my chart in previous classes.


502
00:24:44.700 --> 00:24:47.400
My Mercury is square or


503
00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:50.500
Square. My Mercury is trying my Mars. My Mercury


504
00:24:50.500 --> 00:24:51.400
is opposite Uranus.


505
00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:55.200
So my brain moves very fast. So what ends up happening for me is


506
00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:58.500
I end up seeing these relationships before my brain


507
00:24:58.500 --> 00:25:01.400
processes it or my brains process it before I can put it


508
00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:04.500
into a thought. I don't really know how to explain it, but it's very


509
00:25:04.500 --> 00:25:07.300
quick. I want to make sure that you guys can do this as


510
00:25:07.300 --> 00:25:08.000
well now.


511
00:25:10.500 --> 00:25:11.400
Lilith here


512
00:25:13.300 --> 00:25:16.200
for this person. If we ever get into deeper dive


513
00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:20.200
you would want to know how Mars Square Lilith


514
00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:21.600
actually plays out.


515
00:25:23.100 --> 00:25:24.500
We're not going to talk about that right now.


516
00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:28.700
We are going to talk about the fact that now we know that there's a


517
00:25:28.700 --> 00:25:31.400
lot of communication that ends up happening on


518
00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:36.800
a global level especially about culture especially about anything of


519
00:25:35.800 --> 00:25:38.300
a theatrical nature and Things


520
00:25:38.300 --> 00:25:39.000
Are.


521
00:25:42.300 --> 00:25:45.200
I guess blown out of proportions the right way not everything is


522
00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:48.100
truthful. It's not just the rule of the sixth house that also just has


523
00:25:48.100 --> 00:25:48.600
Neptune.


524
00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:52.200
Traits so not everything is truthful. It's a


525
00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:56.000
bit of a story especially with these two linked together things are


526
00:25:55.900 --> 00:25:58.600
you know, Jupiter Sagittarius is


527
00:25:58.600 --> 00:26:01.200
ruled by Jupiter Jupiter is expansive.


528
00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:02.900
That goes out.


529
00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:09.200
And creates, you know expansion creates


530
00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:11.500
more more than there


531
00:26:11.500 --> 00:26:14.100
should be right. So a little thing becomes a big


532
00:26:14.100 --> 00:26:17.300
thing, right? So if it was a little secret they got out it explodes it


533
00:26:17.300 --> 00:26:20.300
becomes this huge thing because there's Neptune there. It's not even what


534
00:26:20.300 --> 00:26:23.800
really happened in the first place with this person. It's entertaining


535
00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:26.200
it has to do with their personality them as a person


536
00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:29.500
and friends are usually involved or things that


537
00:26:29.500 --> 00:26:32.500
happen very randomly and those things


538
00:26:32.500 --> 00:26:36.000
would affect this person's value their


539
00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:37.400
self-worth on a very deep level.


540
00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:41.800
And also would cause


541
00:26:41.800 --> 00:26:42.700
them to react.


542
00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:47.100
From a very deep level as well trying to


543
00:26:46.100 --> 00:26:49.600
bottle everything up and keep it secret although


544
00:26:49.600 --> 00:26:52.200
it will eventually explode and they could


545
00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:52.600
snap.


546
00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:56.400
At some point because Jupiter the ruler of the third house


547
00:26:56.400 --> 00:26:59.500
is here. Right? So I'm hoping you followed


548
00:26:59.500 --> 00:27:02.200
along up to this point all we've talked


549
00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:06.100
about through all of this here is how


550
00:27:05.100 --> 00:27:08.400
their relationship is on the


551
00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:11.400
fundamental terms of their one-to-one pairing of


552
00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:12.200
a relationship.


553
00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:13.500
right


554
00:27:14.900 --> 00:27:17.600
So when I'm pulling this together this everything I


555
00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:20.600
just said has only to do with the relationship


556
00:27:20.600 --> 00:27:22.200
as a whole.


557
00:27:23.100 --> 00:27:26.800
There for and every relationship and their first marriage relationship as


558
00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:29.500
a whole becomes a huge huge thing. And when


559
00:27:29.500 --> 00:27:32.200
I say relationship first marriage is anything


560
00:27:32.200 --> 00:27:35.200
that is long-term engagements.


561
00:27:36.300 --> 00:27:39.500
I've noticed engagements tend to fall under legal


562
00:27:39.500 --> 00:27:40.300
contracts.


563
00:27:41.300 --> 00:27:41.600
as well


564
00:27:42.500 --> 00:27:45.500
I know that in my own chart my first my seventh


565
00:27:45.500 --> 00:27:48.400
house is actually a girl. I never married, but we did get engaged


566
00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:51.400
because my second is clearly my first marriage


567
00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:54.600
and my third is clearly my second marriage. So it's interesting to


568
00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:57.300
see that engagements actually have shown up as


569
00:27:57.300 --> 00:28:00.900
one of these houses. So it could be like married engaged engaged


570
00:28:00.900 --> 00:28:03.700
married and this could actually be the second marriage because


571
00:28:03.700 --> 00:28:06.400
there were two engagements in there as well those count as


572
00:28:06.400 --> 00:28:09.100
legal contracts as well. I'm assuming because


573
00:28:10.300 --> 00:28:13.000
What rules that is the bond?


574
00:28:15.100 --> 00:28:18.800
Other than that, I don't know that I can fully explain it at this


575
00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:21.100
point. I'll have to look into it further to see


576
00:28:21.100 --> 00:28:24.400
if I can come up with a more rational explanation here. But this


577
00:28:24.400 --> 00:28:25.900
is how the relationship plays out.


578
00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:29.200
Every relationship they have will play out the same


579
00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:32.400
way in order for it to play out a different way. If they really want to keep things


580
00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:35.900
secret. They would have to work either in Reverse. We didn't


581
00:28:35.900 --> 00:28:39.400
even keep going like you can like I said, you can do layering


582
00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:41.000
and linking here. You can take


583
00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:44.600
Sagittarius ruler here. It's at one degree. We know with or orbs


584
00:28:44.600 --> 00:28:45.100
of influence.


585
00:28:46.300 --> 00:28:49.100
That Jupiter has a seven to eight degree orb of


586
00:28:49.100 --> 00:28:52.600
influence, which means it's pushing over hitting Pluto and it's creating.


587
00:28:52.600 --> 00:28:54.600
It's actually creating either.


588
00:28:55.900 --> 00:28:56.600
and or


589
00:28:59.700 --> 00:29:02.900
issues within their personal life


590
00:29:02.900 --> 00:29:04.000
them as a human.


591
00:29:06.500 --> 00:29:09.400
Issues within their career because Saturn which rules


592
00:29:09.400 --> 00:29:12.900
careers reaching in or within their relationships as


593
00:29:12.900 --> 00:29:15.400
a whole because they are Libra rule. They


594
00:29:15.400 --> 00:29:18.200
are venous ruled, right and Venus here


595
00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:21.400
for them is in their fourth house. That's a whole different thing. We're


596
00:29:21.400 --> 00:29:24.700
just talking about love. This is their personal life and this


597
00:29:24.700 --> 00:29:27.400
all affects their home life their mother it


598
00:29:27.400 --> 00:29:30.400
all comes back to their mother their relationship with their mother and how


599
00:29:30.400 --> 00:29:34.200
they need to separate from the their identity within their


600
00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:36.400
structure caring their


601
00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:38.500
traditional home values and things like that because


602
00:29:39.500 --> 00:29:42.500
It's all being disrupted by all of this now. I'm not


603
00:29:42.500 --> 00:29:44.900
done you got to keep going.


604
00:29:45.700 --> 00:29:48.100
We just looked at layering. We looked at


605
00:29:48.100 --> 00:29:51.600
rulerships. All right, we've got all this information here


606
00:29:51.600 --> 00:29:53.300
and we've gotten pretty specific.


607
00:29:54.400 --> 00:29:57.400
But some of what we said we can add information


608
00:29:57.400 --> 00:30:00.400
some of what we said may end up changing information.


609
00:30:00.400 --> 00:30:03.500
We have to look at the aspects.


610
00:30:04.300 --> 00:30:07.200
And this is where it gets complicated and you're going to devise your own


611
00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:07.600
method.


612
00:30:08.500 --> 00:30:11.400
I'm going to teach you what I do, but you're gonna divide your own method of what


613
00:30:11.400 --> 00:30:14.300
order you do this in that's going to make it work for


614
00:30:14.300 --> 00:30:17.900
you in your mind because that's what it all comes down to being an


615
00:30:17.900 --> 00:30:21.000
astrologer. I know that every single person thinks differently. I'm


616
00:30:20.500 --> 00:30:23.500
a Mercury and Gemini you might also be a


617
00:30:23.500 --> 00:30:26.300
Mercury and Gemini while there are similarities between me and


618
00:30:26.300 --> 00:30:29.300
you it will not be the same across the board. You will


619
00:30:29.300 --> 00:30:31.800
think differently in some ways than I will.


620
00:30:32.700 --> 00:30:35.200
If you have your Mercury aspecting Neptune, you may think


621
00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:39.000
a bit more abstractly and kind of be more


622
00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:42.100
logically photo-oriented where


623
00:30:41.100 --> 00:30:44.100
you're kind of putting a puzzle together in your


624
00:30:44.100 --> 00:30:47.400
head Mercury retrograde kind of has a very similar Vibe as


625
00:30:47.400 --> 00:30:50.900
well. If you have it aspecting Jupiter,


626
00:30:50.900 --> 00:30:53.200
you may overthink to


627
00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:57.100
the point where you accidentally come


628
00:30:56.100 --> 00:30:59.500
across the right answer because it's like luck is involved


629
00:30:59.500 --> 00:31:03.000
here because you're you're literally thinking in so many tangents that


630
00:31:02.300 --> 00:31:04.600
one of them ends up bringing you the answer.


631
00:31:05.500 --> 00:31:05.700
so


632
00:31:06.800 --> 00:31:10.300
Understand that when you're processing this altogether that


633
00:31:09.300 --> 00:31:12.300
it is going to be different for you than it is for me.


634
00:31:12.300 --> 00:31:15.200
But let's go back to the ruler remember it's an empty house. So


635
00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:18.300
this one's easy. The ruler of Aries is Mars Mars


636
00:31:18.300 --> 00:31:21.100
and Virgo. We know there's critical we know there's service but it's all


637
00:31:21.100 --> 00:31:24.200
behind the scenes. There should be a spiritual connection if we


638
00:31:24.200 --> 00:31:27.600
want it in a positive way, but usually that doesn't end up


639
00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:30.400
happening. It usually ends up with abandonment, which is


640
00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:34.600
also a 12th house abandonment or just leaving or


641
00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:36.300
lies deception things of


642
00:31:36.300 --> 00:31:38.300
that nature because that's all twelfth house as well.


643
00:31:39.500 --> 00:31:42.800
And we know that the ruler is over here. So lies


644
00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:45.700
romance on on and


645
00:31:45.700 --> 00:31:48.500
off again within the the relationship


646
00:31:48.500 --> 00:31:51.600
itself a lot of times and then


647
00:31:51.600 --> 00:31:54.200
you know, like I said lies deception abandonment and things


648
00:31:54.200 --> 00:31:55.000
of that nature just


649
00:31:56.200 --> 00:31:59.400
on off and no one knows why this person doesn't even really know


650
00:31:59.400 --> 00:32:00.100
why to be honest.


651
00:32:01.100 --> 00:32:04.600
So we kind of pull all that together now. Let's go back to Mars roller of


652
00:32:04.600 --> 00:32:05.400
Aries ruler of


653
00:32:06.200 --> 00:32:08.200
relationships this person's relationships


654
00:32:09.500 --> 00:32:11.300
Mars is at 23 degrees.


655
00:32:12.300 --> 00:32:14.600
Now you can do this in one of two ways.


656
00:32:15.300 --> 00:32:18.400
I've gotten so used to using this graph like this. I only


657
00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:21.200
use the bottom part to this part right


658
00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:23.500
here to kind of double check and verify


659
00:32:24.300 --> 00:32:27.600
However, when you're using astrological software as


660
00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:30.400
you've seen in my previous classes not every planet has


661
00:32:30.400 --> 00:32:33.300
the same orb of influence. So when you're looking at all


662
00:32:33.300 --> 00:32:34.600
of these glyphs down here


663
00:32:35.700 --> 00:32:39.100
Sextiles conjunctions semi-squares quintiles trying,


664
00:32:38.100 --> 00:32:41.000
you know


665
00:32:41.400 --> 00:32:44.500
in conjunctions all of these you have to look now in conjunctions seem


666
00:32:44.500 --> 00:32:46.500
to be pretty consistent. So to semi-sex styles.


667
00:32:47.300 --> 00:32:50.300
But some of these I've noticed especially squares that they use


668
00:32:50.300 --> 00:32:53.400
a 10 degree orb of influence now, you can change it but each planet


669
00:32:53.400 --> 00:32:53.900
is different.


670
00:32:54.700 --> 00:32:57.500
And knowing that each plan is different. You have to realize that


671
00:32:57.500 --> 00:33:00.200
some of these in my own chart. I've noticed it, especially when it


672
00:33:00.200 --> 00:33:03.500
comes to the Moon. The Moon does not have a very large orb of influence neither


673
00:33:03.500 --> 00:33:06.700
does Pluto so when you're using these two planets specifically


674
00:33:06.700 --> 00:33:09.400
and they're going outside of a Three Degree


675
00:33:09.400 --> 00:33:12.500
orb of influence and they're saying that you know, let's say


676
00:33:12.500 --> 00:33:15.200
it is Pluto. This person doesn't have it. But let's say it's the


677
00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:18.300
moon in Pluto and they're using a 10 degree orb of influence, right?


678
00:33:18.300 --> 00:33:19.500
So when you zoom in on


679
00:33:20.300 --> 00:33:23.200
on this you'll see like this one right here is a


680
00:33:23.200 --> 00:33:26.200
square and has a 7 that's a seven


681
00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:30.500
degree orb and it is applying versus separating separating


682
00:33:29.500 --> 00:33:32.400
again is that the faster


683
00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:35.300
planet has already passed the slower planet and is moving


684
00:33:35.300 --> 00:33:38.200
away. So the energy is loosening applying means


685
00:33:38.200 --> 00:33:41.400
that the faster planet is approaching the slower planet


686
00:33:41.400 --> 00:33:44.400
and that energy that angle is applying into a conjunction.


687
00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:48.400
Or you know if it's a square it's applying into it. Right? It's


688
00:33:48.400 --> 00:33:50.500
applying it to the square. It's applying into the opposition.


689
00:33:51.300 --> 00:33:54.500
That energy is a bit stronger because that faster moving


690
00:33:54.500 --> 00:33:57.500
planet is moving with time pushing forward


691
00:33:57.500 --> 00:34:00.200
into the slower moving planet.


692
00:34:01.700 --> 00:34:04.800
When you see the moon and Pluto having any


693
00:34:04.800 --> 00:34:07.500
sort of aspect here and you see a seven,


694
00:34:07.500 --> 00:34:10.600
it's not it is not right. They


695
00:34:10.600 --> 00:34:13.400
both have about two to three orb of him degree orb


696
00:34:13.400 --> 00:34:16.300
of influence so seven it's way out. So if you ever see one here and


697
00:34:16.300 --> 00:34:19.400
it's up above three degrees ignore it because it


698
00:34:19.400 --> 00:34:20.900
doesn't apply it's not real.


699
00:34:21.900 --> 00:34:25.300
This can be very confusing when you're reading charts because


700
00:34:24.300 --> 00:34:27.200
you may think that there's like a moon Square


701
00:34:27.200 --> 00:34:30.800
Pluto and then you're talking this person like oh your moon squares Pluto and


702
00:34:30.800 --> 00:34:33.400
then you look into what moon Square Pluto Moon Square Pluto


703
00:34:33.400 --> 00:34:36.400
has to have a tighter orb. Anyway, this can create issues


704
00:34:36.400 --> 00:34:39.600
with the mother. It can create a deep bond


705
00:34:39.600 --> 00:34:40.400
with the mother that


706
00:34:41.600 --> 00:34:44.400
that is that it can


707
00:34:44.400 --> 00:34:47.400
create like a hover parent type of situation. It can create very


708
00:34:47.400 --> 00:34:50.400
volatile bottled down emotions that


709
00:34:50.400 --> 00:34:53.400
you feel very deeply that kind of come out under certain


710
00:34:53.400 --> 00:34:55.200
triggered events and circumstances, but


711
00:34:56.400 --> 00:34:59.300
The positive or negative if it's above three degrees,


712
00:34:59.300 --> 00:35:02.300
it's not there anyway, so you have to look into that. So


713
00:35:02.300 --> 00:35:03.200
anyway with that being said


714
00:35:04.300 --> 00:35:07.600
these would be the aspects and you can always just say you know,


715
00:35:07.600 --> 00:35:10.700
what I want to look at Mars Mars is in Virgo and


716
00:35:10.700 --> 00:35:13.200
I did this at the beginning just to double check but you can just go


717
00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:13.600
down here.


718
00:35:14.500 --> 00:35:17.200
And you can say Okay Mars Mars is here.


719
00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:20.300
That's a two queen quintile. That's a


720
00:35:20.300 --> 00:35:20.700
zero.


721
00:35:23.900 --> 00:35:26.300
Square that's a one that's all good. This


722
00:35:26.300 --> 00:35:31.400
is a three that might be a little loose for a semi-sex tile


723
00:35:31.400 --> 00:35:35.600
but we'll keep going down Mars with the midheaven


724
00:35:34.600 --> 00:35:37.300
being square at


725
00:35:37.300 --> 00:35:38.600
10 degrees. No.


726
00:35:39.400 --> 00:35:42.400
No squares have a less lesser orb of influence. Anyway


727
00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:45.600
Mars is only for give or take four degrees


728
00:35:45.600 --> 00:35:48.200
the mid Heavens a point. So it has no warb of


729
00:35:48.200 --> 00:35:51.900
influence. So 10 is ridiculous. So 10 is


730
00:35:51.900 --> 00:35:54.500
not accurate. This person does not have a Mars


731
00:35:54.500 --> 00:35:56.200
Square midheaven.


732
00:35:56.900 --> 00:35:57.700
This is nonsense.


733
00:35:58.700 --> 00:36:03.400
Same thing here Mars conjunct the


734
00:36:01.400 --> 00:36:04.100
ascendant.


735
00:36:05.300 --> 00:36:08.600
So here it is the Senate and midheaven right nine degrees.


736
00:36:08.600 --> 00:36:11.300
No because Mars doesn't have that much of an


737
00:36:11.300 --> 00:36:13.500
orb of influence. These are not true.


738
00:36:14.500 --> 00:36:17.800
This would make this person hyper aggressive potentially hyper


739
00:36:17.800 --> 00:36:20.500
aggressive hypercritical from like behind the scenes.


740
00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:26.700
And then that would translate back down to home life


741
00:36:26.700 --> 00:36:29.900
and communication and siblings and whatnot. This would


742
00:36:29.900 --> 00:36:32.200
be more aggressive potentially aggressive on the


743
00:36:32.200 --> 00:36:33.400
lower end of it. But anyway,


744
00:36:34.300 --> 00:36:37.000
when we're looking back at Mars the way that


745
00:36:37.100 --> 00:36:40.300
I do it because I'm more numbers oriented. Like I said, you can just come down here


746
00:36:40.300 --> 00:36:42.000
and kind of look to see what we're talking about here.


747
00:36:42.900 --> 00:36:45.200
But I need to know all these different aspects every single


748
00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:48.800
one of these aspects means something the ones that are legitimate they


749
00:36:48.800 --> 00:36:49.300
all mean something.


750
00:36:50.300 --> 00:36:54.300
It makes this Mars in whatever context whatever lens you're


751
00:36:53.300 --> 00:36:56.100
talking about play out differently than


752
00:36:56.100 --> 00:36:59.500
just Mars Mars energy is just the basis


753
00:36:59.500 --> 00:37:02.100
everything else gets layered on top. So now


754
00:37:02.100 --> 00:37:06.600
we're coming down here. We're looking at here. We see a 23


755
00:37:07.500 --> 00:37:10.300
And then I see a 19 now, I would


756
00:37:10.300 --> 00:37:13.200
consider this one to be a Trine it is


757
00:37:13.200 --> 00:37:16.400
within the orb of influence. What's interesting is it's not showing one,


758
00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:19.500
but that's I think because I took off all the aspects to


759
00:37:19.500 --> 00:37:20.800
other planets and whatnot.


760
00:37:22.700 --> 00:37:24.200
When you go to chart selection.


761
00:37:25.200 --> 00:37:28.500
In Astro, yes, you can see over here. It won't


762
00:37:28.500 --> 00:37:31.400
scroll very far, but you can see over here that says


763
00:37:31.400 --> 00:37:34.400
aspects and then to all objects. I


764
00:37:34.400 --> 00:37:36.800
do not have clicked and that's why you are not seeing.


765
00:37:37.900 --> 00:37:40.900
That but this is a Trine so Chiron is


766
00:37:40.900 --> 00:37:43.500
forming a shrine here. This person is


767
00:37:43.500 --> 00:37:46.300
actually benefiting a deep down


768
00:37:46.300 --> 00:37:49.500
psychology using relationships to heal themselves.


769
00:37:49.500 --> 00:37:52.600
Now trying to not always positive squares are


770
00:37:52.600 --> 00:37:55.400
not always negative. This can also mean that anything that


771
00:37:55.400 --> 00:37:58.600
is deep down in unresolved will immediately affect this


772
00:37:58.600 --> 00:37:59.800
person's relationships.


773
00:38:00.900 --> 00:38:03.800
So we'll talk about that in a different class how Chiron


774
00:38:03.800 --> 00:38:05.900
when I talk more about Chiron affects this.


775
00:38:07.400 --> 00:38:10.500
Also at 23 degrees we have 25.


776
00:38:11.400 --> 00:38:14.300
Now Venus to Chiron does not make a try


777
00:38:14.300 --> 00:38:17.200
and it's outside the orb of influence but Mars to Venus does so this is


778
00:38:17.200 --> 00:38:20.800
not a grand Shrine for anybody who is interested or knows about aspect patterns


779
00:38:20.800 --> 00:38:23.400
aspect patterns. I guess we'll be another class


780
00:38:23.400 --> 00:38:27.100
now that I'm thinking about it because it creates


781
00:38:28.500 --> 00:38:31.300
it creates a lot of energy that works either harmoniously or


782
00:38:31.300 --> 00:38:34.500
within competition of itself to create these


783
00:38:34.500 --> 00:38:37.300
if this was a grant trying to make a


784
00:38:37.300 --> 00:38:40.300
big old triangle right here, but it's not because it's all outside the orb


785
00:38:40.300 --> 00:38:43.600
of influence but 23 degrees to 25 degrees


786
00:38:43.600 --> 00:38:46.600
means that the home life the


787
00:38:46.600 --> 00:38:49.300
structure of home the father.


788
00:38:50.300 --> 00:38:54.200
and the father's influence on this person's values is


789
00:38:53.200 --> 00:38:56.700
all impacted within so this


790
00:38:56.700 --> 00:38:58.000
person basically is


791
00:38:59.100 --> 00:39:02.500
could potentially be looking for a partner that embodies the


792
00:39:02.500 --> 00:39:05.500
values of their father assuming that


793
00:39:05.500 --> 00:39:09.000
Venus is not ill aspected which it


794
00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:09.000
is.


795
00:39:10.700 --> 00:39:13.200
And this is where it gets complicated and this is why I'm showing you this


796
00:39:13.200 --> 00:39:14.700
class right? So


797
00:39:16.100 --> 00:39:16.700
this person


798
00:39:17.500 --> 00:39:20.500
if Venus was not impacting anything else.


799
00:39:21.500 --> 00:39:24.700
this person would be looking for someone who embodies


800
00:39:24.700 --> 00:39:27.200
the values of their father that they grew up


801
00:39:27.200 --> 00:39:30.200
with the things that they know from their childhood, but


802
00:39:31.100 --> 00:39:34.900
Because Venus is semi-sexile Neptune.


803
00:39:34.900 --> 00:39:37.600
You see 24 degrees. You see 25 degrees one


804
00:39:37.600 --> 00:39:40.800
degree give or take. This is a semi-sexstyle this


805
00:39:40.800 --> 00:39:43.300
so there is an agitation here that has to


806
00:39:43.300 --> 00:39:46.000
do with Neptune in


807
00:39:46.100 --> 00:39:48.500
the third house and Sagittarius.


808
00:39:50.900 --> 00:39:53.100
This could this could mean a lot of things actually, so


809
00:39:53.100 --> 00:39:56.100
I'm going to come back to this in a minute Lilith would be impacted as well


810
00:39:56.100 --> 00:39:58.800
not doing well with right now, but there's a square also.


811
00:39:59.900 --> 00:40:02.400
To Pluto from Venus and there


812
00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:04.900
is a semi sextile from Mars to Pluto.


813
00:40:05.500 --> 00:40:08.100
Is a lot of information this is a lot and this is


814
00:40:08.100 --> 00:40:11.300
why you have to break it down. And the more you do this the more it'll


815
00:40:11.300 --> 00:40:13.800
start clicking in head in your head because you won't have to


816
00:40:14.600 --> 00:40:17.200
stop every five seconds to remind yourself of what


817
00:40:17.200 --> 00:40:20.600
each one of these planets means even though I do hundreds


818
00:40:20.600 --> 00:40:22.300
of chart readings every month.


819
00:40:23.300 --> 00:40:27.000
I still have to stop for some of these especially semi


820
00:40:26.200 --> 00:40:29.200
sex tiles because they are more difficult to work with


821
00:40:29.200 --> 00:40:32.400
because it's a slight agitation, but it's such


822
00:40:32.400 --> 00:40:34.900
a slight agitation that it creates a compartmentalization.


823
00:40:36.800 --> 00:40:39.200
and when you have so many planets impacting each other


824
00:40:39.200 --> 00:40:42.500
you have to do this, like string theory feels like


825
00:40:42.500 --> 00:40:45.200
like this one links to this then this happens to this


826
00:40:45.200 --> 00:40:46.800
and then you're doing the readings you're like


827
00:40:47.400 --> 00:40:51.100
I got to pull all this third house energy into this 12th


828
00:40:50.100 --> 00:40:53.100
house energy into the in the first


829
00:40:53.100 --> 00:40:56.200
house energy with the fifth house, right or I'm sorry with the


830
00:40:56.200 --> 00:40:57.100
fourth because we're talking about Venus.


831
00:40:58.200 --> 00:41:01.300
So break it down. This is the most important


832
00:41:01.300 --> 00:41:02.200
thing of what I'm saying.


833
00:41:04.200 --> 00:41:07.300
You have to break it down or this will become


834
00:41:07.300 --> 00:41:10.600
extremely overwhelming and that's what we don't want for anybody.


835
00:41:10.600 --> 00:41:13.600
You don't have to go as far layered down


836
00:41:13.600 --> 00:41:16.400
as I'm going but the further you go the


837
00:41:16.400 --> 00:41:18.400
more details you're going to get because energy.


838
00:41:19.400 --> 00:41:22.400
That is linked to energy that is ruled by other energy that


839
00:41:22.400 --> 00:41:25.300
conflicts with other energy. All it's doing is whittling away


840
00:41:25.300 --> 00:41:28.300
the possibilities so now I it's not


841
00:41:28.300 --> 00:41:29.300
just Mmm.


842
00:41:29.900 --> 00:41:32.500
Where we started excuse me allergy has


843
00:41:32.500 --> 00:41:36.000
been crazy the last couple of days. It's not just where we started with Aries being


844
00:41:35.500 --> 00:41:38.300
the ruler Mars being in the 12th house


845
00:41:38.300 --> 00:41:40.400
and leaving at that. See that's what most people do.


846
00:41:41.400 --> 00:41:44.500
That's what most astrologers do and this is the difference between you


847
00:41:44.500 --> 00:41:47.200
and everybody else because you're not going


848
00:41:47.200 --> 00:41:50.800
to stop here. You're not just gonna say okay. Your relationships


849
00:41:50.800 --> 00:41:53.100
are on the back burner, you're critical of


850
00:41:53.100 --> 00:41:56.700
your relationships. You could have a spiritual relationship if


851
00:41:56.700 --> 00:41:59.100
you wanted but it's sitting


852
00:41:59.100 --> 00:42:02.300
there and maybe your relationships kind of you know, you jump in


853
00:42:02.300 --> 00:42:05.300
you end and then you forget about them and leave it


854
00:42:05.300 --> 00:42:08.500
at that because that's not the full truth. There's more


855
00:42:08.500 --> 00:42:11.200
to it. The whole point of it being talked about


856
00:42:11.200 --> 00:42:14.200
and broadcast is a pretty important thing. How do they


857
00:42:14.200 --> 00:42:17.400
deal with this? Well, they deal with it by the energy. That's more the next class.


858
00:42:18.400 --> 00:42:21.800
You deal with the energies within what's connected


859
00:42:21.800 --> 00:42:24.700
to here. But so we're diving deeper and we're


860
00:42:24.700 --> 00:42:27.800
seeing this trying that means relationships are harmonious with


861
00:42:27.800 --> 00:42:30.200
values, but those values


862
00:42:30.800 --> 00:42:31.400
are not


863
00:42:32.200 --> 00:42:35.200
standardized within this field right? So we


864
00:42:35.200 --> 00:42:38.200
break it down. We say Mars ruler or I'm


865
00:42:38.200 --> 00:42:41.200
sorry Ares ruler from the seventh house is Mars Mars and Virgos and the


866
00:42:41.200 --> 00:42:44.400
12th house. We've analyzed that we have what we have if you need to write


867
00:42:44.400 --> 00:42:47.200
it down like jot notes jot it.


868
00:42:49.400 --> 00:42:52.400
and then you know, I mean when you're doing a reading like if you


869
00:42:52.400 --> 00:42:53.800
can't rememberize everything you've just


870
00:42:54.600 --> 00:42:56.600
connected write it down as you're going.


871
00:42:57.400 --> 00:43:00.700
Especially in the beginning because it may help you. Remember how


872
00:43:00.700 --> 00:43:03.200
you connected things. This Mars is


873
00:43:03.200 --> 00:43:06.000
trying Venus. What does that mean?


874
00:43:06.800 --> 00:43:09.400
Well, we already talked about that means that the relationships which are


875
00:43:09.400 --> 00:43:12.200
sitting behind that she's critical of I'm assuming


876
00:43:12.200 --> 00:43:15.400
there's a female that there are there's value to


877
00:43:15.400 --> 00:43:18.300
the relationship and there's definitely a sensual appeal within her


878
00:43:18.300 --> 00:43:21.300
relationships that have to do with maybe they even like to


879
00:43:21.300 --> 00:43:24.300
go out to eat together, but they like to either have


880
00:43:24.300 --> 00:43:27.400
it ordered in or potentially cook


881
00:43:27.400 --> 00:43:30.100
at home. And that maybe that's what she does is she likes to cook


882
00:43:30.100 --> 00:43:31.900
and she does that, you know behind the scenes.


883
00:43:33.300 --> 00:43:36.200
But that here is trying Venus. Well that goes along


884
00:43:36.200 --> 00:43:39.600
with cooking because Venus rules food and it's


885
00:43:39.600 --> 00:43:42.400
in the fourth house of home. So this is a very good.


886
00:43:43.400 --> 00:43:46.000
Start to the assessment but what ends up


887
00:43:46.300 --> 00:43:50.200
happening is so we're saying that it's all trying here. Awesome. Ooh, there's


888
00:43:50.200 --> 00:43:54.400
a semi-sex tile to Neptune in


889
00:43:53.400 --> 00:43:55.300
the third house.


890
00:43:56.200 --> 00:43:59.100
Sagittarius so this person


891
00:44:00.100 --> 00:44:03.500
in terms of like cooking food and whatnot. It can't be something that's


892
00:44:03.500 --> 00:44:06.600
probably person probably doesn't like seafood because we're talking about International water


893
00:44:06.600 --> 00:44:09.400
and there's an agitation here, especially anything


894
00:44:09.400 --> 00:44:12.200
that's local which is the third house. We got


895
00:44:12.200 --> 00:44:15.100
all this other energy here. I'm not gonna decipher all of this right now.


896
00:44:15.100 --> 00:44:19.600
I'm just gonna leave it at that. I want to get to the next thing stallions. The


897
00:44:19.600 --> 00:44:22.100
class isn't long enough to dive into a stallion or satellitium right


898
00:44:22.100 --> 00:44:22.200
now.


899
00:44:23.100 --> 00:44:26.100
But there's a square to Pluto Pluto is


900
00:44:26.100 --> 00:44:28.500
changes its Evolution and oftentimes.


901
00:44:29.400 --> 00:44:32.700
If you link it like it would be in the in the tarot. It


902
00:44:32.700 --> 00:44:35.400
is a death card. It's a it's a stop. It's


903
00:44:35.400 --> 00:44:38.500
a ending. It's a it's a new cycle. So


904
00:44:38.500 --> 00:44:39.300
with this person.


905
00:44:41.200 --> 00:44:44.700
Especially since Venus is conjunct and here they actually


906
00:44:44.700 --> 00:44:47.500
want their partner partner to


907
00:44:47.500 --> 00:44:50.200
do the responsibility to cook for


908
00:44:50.200 --> 00:44:52.200
them to change the role.


909
00:44:53.100 --> 00:44:56.100
So this person expects their partner to cook for


910
00:44:56.100 --> 00:44:59.300
them at home. That's how you would read that in terms


911
00:44:59.300 --> 00:45:03.000
of food in terms of value and Father's


912
00:45:02.400 --> 00:45:05.400
values, which we were kind of talking about before that's the


913
00:45:05.400 --> 00:45:08.300
lens we're switching in. So now we're now we're in a lens


914
00:45:08.300 --> 00:45:09.000
within a lens.


915
00:45:09.700 --> 00:45:12.300
Don't get overwhelmed pause go back if


916
00:45:12.300 --> 00:45:12.600
you need to.


917
00:45:13.700 --> 00:45:16.700
Take a look at everything that got us to this point. I promise


918
00:45:16.700 --> 00:45:19.200
you it gets easier over and over because it just becomes


919
00:45:19.200 --> 00:45:22.400
second nature as you're going. It's kind of like when you're


920
00:45:22.400 --> 00:45:25.500
in Spanish class, if you if you


921
00:45:25.500 --> 00:45:28.200
learn the words and then kind of put together


922
00:45:28.200 --> 00:45:31.500
a phrase and then oh God,


923
00:45:31.500 --> 00:45:32.500
where do they call conjunctions?


924
00:45:33.500 --> 00:45:36.200
No, not good Junction where they called I can't


925
00:45:36.200 --> 00:45:39.900
remember the word but it's the tenses past present future.


926
00:45:40.900 --> 00:45:43.700
I don't know. I can't remember the word right now. But yeah, I struggled with


927
00:45:43.700 --> 00:45:46.100
that and then you have to learn the slang and then you


928
00:45:46.100 --> 00:45:49.300
have to put it all together and then you've got to be able to have the conversation right? It's


929
00:45:49.300 --> 00:45:52.200
step by step when in school when they try


930
00:45:52.200 --> 00:45:55.600
to teach you all that and get you to talking. It's overwhelming and


931
00:45:55.600 --> 00:45:58.300
this is why most people don't learn language. They learn what they


932
00:45:58.300 --> 00:46:00.900
needed to and they just walk away from him because like that's too much.


933
00:46:01.800 --> 00:46:04.300
So when you get to astrology and you're trying to learn it is


934
00:46:04.300 --> 00:46:07.500
not too much. Once you've gotten to it take it baby steps at


935
00:46:07.500 --> 00:46:10.300
a time. We are layering in layering is more


936
00:46:10.300 --> 00:46:13.400
complicated. This is why I say do what you need to do to be


937
00:46:13.400 --> 00:46:16.500
able to get here, but let me keep going. So now we're a lens


938
00:46:16.500 --> 00:46:19.400
within a lens we're talking about the lens of her values within


939
00:46:19.400 --> 00:46:21.600
her father within the lens of a relationship.


940
00:46:22.600 --> 00:46:25.400
So that here squares Pluto Pluto has


941
00:46:25.400 --> 00:46:28.200
to do with things that are deep down Evolution intimacy. So


942
00:46:28.200 --> 00:46:31.600
there's a square this is actually striving for


943
00:46:31.600 --> 00:46:32.500
but pushing away.


944
00:46:33.700 --> 00:46:36.300
An intimacy with a partner that she never had


945
00:46:36.300 --> 00:46:37.000
with her father.


946
00:46:38.500 --> 00:46:41.600
is how you kind of read this and she's looking for something traditional and


947
00:46:41.600 --> 00:46:43.300
long-term, but also


948
00:46:44.600 --> 00:46:48.600
something that she can create her own Traditions within


949
00:46:47.600 --> 00:46:50.100
her relationship with her partner.


950
00:46:51.100 --> 00:46:54.600
Something that is more future oriented. Something's a little bit more less traditional


951
00:46:54.600 --> 00:46:56.700
more just forward paste here.


952
00:46:57.700 --> 00:47:00.100
And it has to do with the communications. It has to do with


953
00:47:00.100 --> 00:47:03.300
the potentially with siblings as


954
00:47:03.300 --> 00:47:05.100
well with her family.


955
00:47:06.200 --> 00:47:09.900
So there may have been issues between her and a sibling her and several


956
00:47:09.900 --> 00:47:12.800
siblings. Usually it's the first sibling or it


957
00:47:12.800 --> 00:47:15.500
could be cousins as well that creates that agitation.


958
00:47:15.500 --> 00:47:18.700
So that's what she's looking for within a relationship. Boom. We stop


959
00:47:18.700 --> 00:47:21.100
there. We don't need to dive we don't


960
00:47:21.100 --> 00:47:24.300
need to keep going. This is the thing with astrology. It's a


961
00:47:24.300 --> 00:47:24.700
rabbit hole.


962
00:47:25.300 --> 00:47:28.200
It is a vortex and if you don't pick a point


963
00:47:28.200 --> 00:47:31.400
to stop you will keep going. This is why I've


964
00:47:31.400 --> 00:47:34.200
been studying my own chart for so freaking long and it


965
00:47:34.200 --> 00:47:37.900
can be really amazing. Like I'm not Downing astrology in


966
00:47:37.900 --> 00:47:39.900
any way, but if you don't pick us stopping point


967
00:47:40.800 --> 00:47:43.500
This will consume you and you'll never get the reading done.


968
00:47:44.300 --> 00:47:47.200
And I'm telling you this because I used to have this problem because I


969
00:47:47.200 --> 00:47:50.300
keep looking for information diving deep down and as a Gemini a


970
00:47:50.300 --> 00:47:53.200
Mercury Gemini and a son in Gemini. I


971
00:47:53.200 --> 00:47:56.500
love me some info. I love some communicate. There's


972
00:47:56.500 --> 00:47:59.000
some communicating. I can't say the word. I love


973
00:47:59.700 --> 00:48:02.500
communication and I love information data statistics all that


974
00:48:02.500 --> 00:48:05.800
kind of stuff. I live for that stuff. But I


975
00:48:05.800 --> 00:48:08.200
have a Jupiter in Scorpio actually like


976
00:48:08.200 --> 00:48:09.100
this person would


977
00:48:09.800 --> 00:48:12.400
so I obsess and mine


978
00:48:12.400 --> 00:48:15.200
is in the fourth house going into the Third on my IC. So anything


979
00:48:15.200 --> 00:48:18.400
that's personal and deep and dear to me. I obsess and I


980
00:48:18.400 --> 00:48:21.200
make it, you know, I expand on it and Scorpio is


981
00:48:21.200 --> 00:48:24.300
all about diving deep and deep and deep and deepen because I love astrology so freaking


982
00:48:24.300 --> 00:48:27.200
much because of its validity and accuracy and that's


983
00:48:27.200 --> 00:48:28.100
all my chart as well.


984
00:48:28.900 --> 00:48:31.500
I will keep going. You need to pick a stopping point. We're


985
00:48:31.500 --> 00:48:31.700
done.


986
00:48:32.500 --> 00:48:35.500
Because all you have looked at this entire time, it's


987
00:48:35.500 --> 00:48:35.900
been like an hour.


988
00:48:36.800 --> 00:48:39.100
40 minutes something like that. All we've looked at


989
00:48:39.100 --> 00:48:42.600
is this person's one-to-one relationships in the context of


990
00:48:42.600 --> 00:48:45.000
love in the context of love.


991
00:48:45.600 --> 00:48:48.400
We haven't looked at the career. We haven't looked anything out you'll do


992
00:48:48.400 --> 00:48:51.200
this and you'll do this quick and you'll decide how deep you want to go with all


993
00:48:51.200 --> 00:48:54.700
these energies sometimes to be honest. I will look at this. I'll come


994
00:48:54.700 --> 00:48:57.300
over to Mars in Virgo. I will look this. I'll talk


995
00:48:57.300 --> 00:48:58.500
I speak it out loud.


996
00:48:59.500 --> 00:49:02.800
As things need to change I will make those changes and


997
00:49:02.800 --> 00:49:05.100
discuss those changes as I'm speaking it out loud,


998
00:49:05.100 --> 00:49:08.400
right then we'll come and we'll remember exactly what we were


999
00:49:08.400 --> 00:49:08.800
talking about here.


1000
00:49:10.700 --> 00:49:13.300
And then I'll stop I'll take a look at this and I say I'm


1001
00:49:13.300 --> 00:49:16.600
coming back to this. I know there's a bunch of identity issues.


1002
00:49:16.600 --> 00:49:19.000
I know there's a bunch of communication problems. I know


1003
00:49:19.200 --> 00:49:22.500
there's probably a whole bunch of issues with a sibling whatever sibling


1004
00:49:22.500 --> 00:49:25.700
is Siblings or cousins and specifically the


1005
00:49:25.700 --> 00:49:28.200
oldest sibling. So if this person is


1006
00:49:28.200 --> 00:49:31.300
the oldest and their family it is the one that is directly younger than


1007
00:49:31.300 --> 00:49:34.300
them if it's if they're younger than any other


1008
00:49:34.300 --> 00:49:37.200
siblings it is the oldest sibling, but that is this one.


1009
00:49:37.200 --> 00:49:40.400
I know there's a bunch of stuff going on. It's like best friends


1010
00:49:40.400 --> 00:49:43.200
but not but we love the play together, but, you know,


1011
00:49:43.200 --> 00:49:44.500
maybe we text a lot.


1012
00:49:45.500 --> 00:49:46.900
Like it's a whole thing, right?


1013
00:49:47.900 --> 00:49:51.600
And there's money in abundance and and value


1014
00:49:50.600 --> 00:49:53.100
and stuff that's attached to all


1015
00:49:53.100 --> 00:49:56.800
of that as well. So let's dive into we broke


1016
00:49:56.800 --> 00:49:59.400
it down right in terms of love. So someone's asking


1017
00:49:59.400 --> 00:50:01.800
for a love reading and you're reading these charts. You're like, okay.


1018
00:50:02.600 --> 00:50:05.300
Let's go to your romance. Honestly what


1019
00:50:05.300 --> 00:50:08.300
I always start with this Chiron, but I'm not gonna do that for this because we're


1020
00:50:08.300 --> 00:50:11.500
not really talking about Chiron too much in this so I'm


1021
00:50:11.500 --> 00:50:14.600
gonna skip that as an astrologer. I focus


1022
00:50:14.600 --> 00:50:15.900
heavily on Pluto.


1023
00:50:16.700 --> 00:50:19.100
The moon and Chiron. Those are


1024
00:50:19.100 --> 00:50:22.300
my three points. I always hit them are pretty much always hit them


1025
00:50:22.300 --> 00:50:25.700
in almost every reading because I think that most answers lie


1026
00:50:25.700 --> 00:50:28.400
there when there's a roadblock or you can't do something


1027
00:50:28.400 --> 00:50:31.100
most questions revolve around. Why aren't I this


1028
00:50:31.100 --> 00:50:34.500
why can't I do this? Why do I feel like this which you know is a


1029
00:50:34.500 --> 00:50:37.700
derivative of why do I can't I and it


1030
00:50:37.700 --> 00:50:38.800
usually comes back to these three.


1031
00:50:39.800 --> 00:50:42.300
But I'm not doing that now I'm going to go to the fifth


1032
00:50:42.300 --> 00:50:46.200
house. The fifth house is all about romance. Now


1033
00:50:45.200 --> 00:50:48.900
romance here is interesting because


1034
00:50:48.900 --> 00:50:49.400
we have


1035
00:50:51.300 --> 00:50:51.900
cancer


1036
00:50:52.800 --> 00:50:55.500
it's ruler. The Moon is over


1037
00:50:55.500 --> 00:50:59.000
here in Romance. This Aquarius means


1038
00:50:58.700 --> 00:51:01.800
friendship. It means dreams means. Hope


1039
00:51:01.800 --> 00:51:03.100
skulls friends.


1040
00:51:04.100 --> 00:51:06.900
Technology, you know those main things here, right?


1041
00:51:08.400 --> 00:51:11.600
We know that because cancer the Moon


1042
00:51:11.600 --> 00:51:15.200
is here. And the North Node is here that pulling


1043
00:51:14.200 --> 00:51:17.700
these energies together. This is this is


1044
00:51:17.700 --> 00:51:20.300
a good example here actually, so I'm glad we use this one


1045
00:51:20.300 --> 00:51:23.200
because this has nothing to do with stelliums or


1046
00:51:23.200 --> 00:51:27.000
satellitiums or anything like that. It's just happens to be another placement that


1047
00:51:26.100 --> 00:51:28.900
is here in the same house where the ruler is.


1048
00:51:30.200 --> 00:51:34.200
So when I do the reverse rulership, right fifth house is Romance. The


1049
00:51:33.200 --> 00:51:36.400
Moon is here reverse rulership. The Moon


1050
00:51:36.400 --> 00:51:39.200
is the ruler of cancer cancers in the tenth house.


1051
00:51:39.200 --> 00:51:42.100
What does that mean? Well, this person is likely going to be


1052
00:51:42.100 --> 00:51:45.800
brought relationships through their career


1053
00:51:45.800 --> 00:51:48.700
through the public through their future


1054
00:51:48.700 --> 00:51:50.600
goals and more importantly.


1055
00:51:51.700 --> 00:51:54.100
Because the North Node is in Neptune, that means


1056
00:51:54.100 --> 00:51:54.900
a bunch of things.


1057
00:51:55.900 --> 00:51:57.600
But there's it. There's a public.


1058
00:51:58.400 --> 00:52:01.400
Sense of this but also a home sense like a nurturing sense


1059
00:52:01.400 --> 00:52:05.300
as well. But the North Node here in Neptune


1060
00:52:04.300 --> 00:52:07.500
tells me that this person is going to have a very difficult


1061
00:52:07.500 --> 00:52:10.700
time with romance not relationships


1062
00:52:10.700 --> 00:52:13.900
not marriage. I mean, yes, we saw all the issues there but


1063
00:52:13.900 --> 00:52:16.500
romance starts it right before


1064
00:52:16.500 --> 00:52:19.100
we can even have the relationship. We gotta have


1065
00:52:19.100 --> 00:52:22.400
the romance and this person's relationships are going to die at in the


1066
00:52:22.400 --> 00:52:25.200
beginning of Life is gonna take them longer because the North


1067
00:52:25.200 --> 00:52:28.200
Node usually happens after 30, you can focus on the North


1068
00:52:28.200 --> 00:52:31.300
Node ahead of time if you know astrology, you know, what you want. You want


1069
00:52:31.300 --> 00:52:34.400
to get out of your comfort zone because North Node is all about getting out of your comfort


1070
00:52:34.400 --> 00:52:36.100
zone and I will talk about this in our moon class.


1071
00:52:37.300 --> 00:52:40.200
but getting out of your comfort zone here and also when we


1072
00:52:40.200 --> 00:52:40.700
go back to


1073
00:52:43.100 --> 00:52:46.800
Here we have a sextile I shouldn't


1074
00:52:46.800 --> 00:52:49.500
be jumping around but that's what my mind does when we


1075
00:52:49.500 --> 00:52:52.100
were talking about. The seventh house Mars is a sextile to


1076
00:52:52.100 --> 00:52:55.500
the North Node, but it's a Trine to the South node.


1077
00:52:55.500 --> 00:52:58.200
So it's very easy to get hung up on the south node stuff


1078
00:52:58.200 --> 00:53:01.400
because a Trine is a natural harmonious in your face


1079
00:53:01.400 --> 00:53:05.200
energy in a sextile is a harmonious but


1080
00:53:04.200 --> 00:53:07.700
secret opportunity that


1081
00:53:07.700 --> 00:53:10.700
you have to find and because it's the North Node that secret


1082
00:53:10.700 --> 00:53:13.400
opportunity this can mean that this person can


1083
00:53:13.400 --> 00:53:16.100
have Harmony within relationships, especially in a public level.


1084
00:53:16.900 --> 00:53:19.100
but it's and especially when it comes


1085
00:53:19.100 --> 00:53:20.300
to their career as well, but


1086
00:53:22.100 --> 00:53:25.900
they have to find it and it has to embody neptunian traits.


1087
00:53:25.900 --> 00:53:29.600
So I'm gonna get off of that and it also it opposes Venus.


1088
00:53:28.600 --> 00:53:31.400
So there's a balance here


1089
00:53:31.400 --> 00:53:34.200
between home their home life and what's you know


1090
00:53:34.200 --> 00:53:37.300
theirs versus what's out in the public, you know


1091
00:53:37.300 --> 00:53:40.200
home life career within the relationships as well. But back


1092
00:53:40.200 --> 00:53:43.600
to romance fifth house. We know again


1093
00:53:43.600 --> 00:53:45.000
North note here means


1094
00:53:46.100 --> 00:53:49.200
that it's going to take a while for this person to find somebody


1095
00:53:49.200 --> 00:53:53.100
and there's gonna be a lot of on and off in the relationships friendship


1096
00:53:52.100 --> 00:53:55.800
is highly important because it's Aquarius


1097
00:53:55.800 --> 00:53:57.100
in the fifth house the ruler.


1098
00:53:57.900 --> 00:54:00.600
And we know that there needs to be a nurturing in mothering


1099
00:54:00.600 --> 00:54:03.300
aspect now early on like I said, most of


1100
00:54:03.300 --> 00:54:06.300
these planets most of the energies will play out


1101
00:54:06.300 --> 00:54:09.200
in their default static, you know,


1102
00:54:09.200 --> 00:54:12.700
lowest vibrational type of ways. It's what makes it predictable and


1103
00:54:12.700 --> 00:54:15.300
what's what makes it actually easier for you to determine how this


1104
00:54:15.300 --> 00:54:18.100
will play out in the next class. We're going to talk about how how can


1105
00:54:18.100 --> 00:54:21.200
you change that? But that's not what this is about. This is how does


1106
00:54:21.200 --> 00:54:22.000
it normally play out?


1107
00:54:22.800 --> 00:54:25.000
It will play out that in Romance. One of the


1108
00:54:25.200 --> 00:54:28.200
people feels like the mother either they need to be mothered or they


1109
00:54:28.200 --> 00:54:31.000
are mothering to other people now.


1110
00:54:32.300 --> 00:54:35.200
You can stop here. You can do one or two things.


1111
00:54:36.300 --> 00:54:37.000
We've done the rulership.


1112
00:54:37.800 --> 00:54:40.200
Because it's here. We have not done the fifth house


1113
00:54:40.200 --> 00:54:43.500
rulership. You can do that and that will lead you into all this third house


1114
00:54:43.500 --> 00:54:44.800
Madness now we


1115
00:54:45.700 --> 00:54:49.300
Just because we've talked about this in this brief context that


1116
00:54:48.300 --> 00:54:51.200
means this third house Madness that


1117
00:54:51.200 --> 00:54:54.600
we talked about which was linked to the seventh house means romance


1118
00:54:54.600 --> 00:54:57.300
and the relationship itself are inherently linked together


1119
00:54:57.300 --> 00:54:58.700
by this.


1120
00:54:59.700 --> 00:55:01.300
Because they both lead back to this.


1121
00:55:02.100 --> 00:55:05.500
So romance and the actual relationship and the first marriage


1122
00:55:05.500 --> 00:55:08.200
are all going to be dependent on how these energies play


1123
00:55:08.200 --> 00:55:11.300
out. So if it were my chart, this is where my focus would


1124
00:55:11.300 --> 00:55:12.200
be right here.


1125
00:55:13.600 --> 00:55:14.800
Now the other thing you can do.


1126
00:55:15.600 --> 00:55:18.800
Is you can look at the the aspects to the moon? So


1127
00:55:18.800 --> 00:55:21.600
this is kind of like you remember back in the day. It was like choose your


1128
00:55:21.600 --> 00:55:24.100
own path like the novels. I don't know if any of


1129
00:55:24.100 --> 00:55:25.800
you guys read those but like I know that


1130
00:55:26.800 --> 00:55:29.600
I don't know. I was eight or nine. Maybe not even eight seven


1131
00:55:29.600 --> 00:55:32.500
or eight and I think I read them all the way up to like 16 because they


1132
00:55:32.500 --> 00:55:33.200
you know, they have different.


1133
00:55:34.100 --> 00:55:37.200
Reading levels or whatever, but I love those because you could like,


1134
00:55:37.200 --> 00:55:40.600
you know, you get to a certain point that says if you want to you


1135
00:55:40.600 --> 00:55:40.700
know.


1136
00:55:42.100 --> 00:55:45.500
If you want to accuse this person of this, whatever go


1137
00:55:45.500 --> 00:55:48.600
to page 55, if you want to go home go to


1138
00:55:48.600 --> 00:55:51.200
page 32 and then you would continue the story that way


1139
00:55:51.200 --> 00:55:54.200
and we just kind of Link back. That's kind of how I do astrology as well.


1140
00:55:54.200 --> 00:55:57.400
So that's this is to Choose Your Own Adventure right here. I can


1141
00:55:57.400 --> 00:56:00.100
either see all the aspects linked to what to the


1142
00:56:00.100 --> 00:56:03.800
ruler the 10th house rule is sitting in the fifth house for romance,


1143
00:56:03.800 --> 00:56:04.700
or I can go


1144
00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:06.200
to


1145
00:56:07.400 --> 00:56:10.300
aquarius's ruler Uranus see what's going on over


1146
00:56:10.300 --> 00:56:13.300
there really doesn't matter what order you do it in. It's really


1147
00:56:13.300 --> 00:56:16.300
up to you. I tend to avoid the heavy


1148
00:56:16.300 --> 00:56:18.000
stuff and save it for later because


1149
00:56:19.200 --> 00:56:22.200
I'm gonna have to do it eventually, but I


1150
00:56:22.200 --> 00:56:25.000
can get a lot more out of the way and then come back and end on that.


1151
00:56:25.900 --> 00:56:28.600
Which is interesting because usually my daily life


1152
00:56:28.600 --> 00:56:31.400
I like to handle the harder stuff first so that it's smooth


1153
00:56:31.400 --> 00:56:34.100
sailing doesn't matter pick what you want. It always ends up


1154
00:56:34.100 --> 00:56:39.000
at the same. So what I'm going to do first and ironically usually


1155
00:56:37.600 --> 00:56:40.300
it doesn't matter which


1156
00:56:40.300 --> 00:56:43.400
one you pick you'll end up doing it. Anyway, this is a good example, if


1157
00:56:43.400 --> 00:56:46.100
I were to look at Aquarius Uranus over here


1158
00:56:46.100 --> 00:56:49.200
in the third house, then I'm looking at a zero orb of influence, which


1159
00:56:49.200 --> 00:56:51.000
means I know that the Friendship here.


1160
00:56:52.200 --> 00:56:55.500
Is Multicultural I know that there is


1161
00:56:55.500 --> 00:56:59.000
a lot of philosophy. I know there's travel and expansion. I


1162
00:56:58.100 --> 00:57:00.100
know that there's a lot of like


1163
00:57:00.800 --> 00:57:03.700
experiences shared experiences.


1164
00:57:03.700 --> 00:57:06.300
So this person needs somebody in junos there


1165
00:57:06.300 --> 00:57:09.700
too. And I'm not talking about Juno this this person needs friends with shared


1166
00:57:09.700 --> 00:57:12.900
experiences that they can have a romantic connection with that actually.


1167
00:57:14.100 --> 00:57:17.400
Because it's zero degrees spills over with the orb of influence into


1168
00:57:17.400 --> 00:57:20.600
the second house into Scorpio, which has Jupiter,


1169
00:57:20.600 --> 00:57:23.100
which is this ruler which spills back into the first house. So this


1170
00:57:23.100 --> 00:57:26.500
person identifies heavily with their partner.


1171
00:57:27.400 --> 00:57:30.900
Is how you read that? So this person's self-worth and


1172
00:57:30.900 --> 00:57:32.000
value which is kind of.


1173
00:57:33.200 --> 00:57:34.100
Is a really tough.


1174
00:57:34.900 --> 00:57:37.600
energy to deal with this person's value


1175
00:57:37.600 --> 00:57:38.600
self-worth


1176
00:57:39.300 --> 00:57:42.500
And how they interact with the world is completely


1177
00:57:42.500 --> 00:57:45.300
based off of their relationships. I can tell this


1178
00:57:45.300 --> 00:57:48.200
now. It may also be based off of other things. I'm not looking


1179
00:57:48.200 --> 00:57:51.500
at any other lens, but I can tell that their relationships have a


1180
00:57:51.500 --> 00:57:53.900
heavy influence. Not only are they a Libra Rising?


1181
00:57:54.700 --> 00:57:56.700
but all this


1182
00:57:57.600 --> 00:58:00.500
seventh house and fifth house energy is pointing back


1183
00:58:00.500 --> 00:58:01.100
into it.


1184
00:58:02.200 --> 00:58:05.200
So I know that that's it. Now that takes me here and


1185
00:58:05.200 --> 00:58:08.300
then I'd have to incorporate the rest of this to see what happens with


1186
00:58:08.300 --> 00:58:12.400
their identity within relationships specifically romance,


1187
00:58:11.400 --> 00:58:14.200
but we also talked about the fact that


1188
00:58:15.100 --> 00:58:19.200
Mars also leads you back to the same energy because Mercury is


1189
00:58:19.200 --> 00:58:22.200
the ruler of Virgo which is the ruler of where Mars sits.


1190
00:58:23.300 --> 00:58:26.800
So like I said, this is huge if I end up doing the aspects I


1191
00:58:26.800 --> 00:58:29.500
say okay this here in terms of the


1192
00:58:29.500 --> 00:58:32.800
public element of their romance at 12


1193
00:58:32.800 --> 00:58:35.700
degrees is sex tile


1194
00:58:35.700 --> 00:58:38.300
their son in 10


1195
00:58:38.300 --> 00:58:41.200
degrees. The sun is the


1196
00:58:41.200 --> 00:58:44.100
ruler of Leo up here and there's the part of


1197
00:58:44.100 --> 00:58:47.100
Fortune again not talking about the part of Fortune much here. I'll do


1198
00:58:47.100 --> 00:58:50.300
an Arabic points class later, but it does mean


1199
00:58:50.300 --> 00:58:53.600
abundance it can mean Finance Financial abundance


1200
00:58:53.600 --> 00:58:53.900
as well.


1201
00:58:54.900 --> 00:58:57.400
Something lucky about it now. That means


1202
00:58:57.400 --> 00:58:58.200
that


1203
00:58:59.700 --> 00:59:02.100
The emotional security that they


1204
00:59:02.100 --> 00:59:06.100
have within the friendship in a romance actually brings


1205
00:59:05.100 --> 00:59:08.500
them opportunities that


1206
00:59:08.500 --> 00:59:11.400
could be financially lucrative them for them which actually


1207
00:59:11.400 --> 00:59:13.500
makes them shine more and brings them Pride.


1208
00:59:15.400 --> 00:59:19.100
Based off of their hopes and dreams and furthering their


1209
00:59:19.100 --> 00:59:19.700
friendships.


1210
00:59:20.500 --> 00:59:23.200
So that's how that all ties together. Then you bring in


1211
00:59:23.200 --> 00:59:26.400
these other planets again. I'm not going to do that all but you know


1212
00:59:26.400 --> 00:59:28.800
the communication the identity that's within here.


1213
00:59:29.900 --> 00:59:30.500
and the


1214
00:59:32.200 --> 00:59:35.400
illusion and whatnot and again work.


1215
00:59:35.400 --> 00:59:38.200
So there's an element of work that's within here as well


1216
00:59:38.200 --> 00:59:39.100
or could be


1217
00:59:39.800 --> 00:59:40.700
work in service


1218
00:59:41.600 --> 00:59:42.400
So I'm going to stop there.


1219
00:59:43.300 --> 00:59:46.400
Again, you can go as deep as you want. So now we have a ton of information on


1220
00:59:46.400 --> 00:59:49.900
this person. We know their type of relate their relationships the


1221
00:59:49.900 --> 00:59:52.300
way that they interact with people in terms of love. We


1222
00:59:52.300 --> 00:59:56.000
know their first marriage and how that will play out. We know all about


1223
00:59:55.200 --> 00:59:58.800
how it's going to be basically publicized like


1224
00:59:58.800 --> 01:00:00.800
even if they try to keep a secret it won't


1225
01:00:01.500 --> 01:00:04.400
We know that in Romance. This person has an emotional


1226
01:00:04.400 --> 01:00:07.300
security within romance because the Moon is sitting


1227
01:00:07.300 --> 01:00:10.400
here and more importantly within the friendship and communication with


1228
01:00:10.400 --> 01:00:13.400
the Friendship. They identify again it all


1229
01:00:13.400 --> 01:00:16.300
spills back into the first house. We know that they identify here.


1230
01:00:16.300 --> 01:00:19.500
But if you continue this


1231
01:00:19.500 --> 01:00:22.300
trend further, right zero into zero degrees


1232
01:00:22.300 --> 01:00:25.100
spills in the second house for one degree spills in


1233
01:00:25.100 --> 01:00:27.100
the first house this Pluto.


1234
01:00:28.100 --> 01:00:31.900
Remember earlier squares Venus. So it actually creates


1235
01:00:31.900 --> 01:00:34.900
their identity ends up getting subsumed into


1236
01:00:34.900 --> 01:00:37.300
their Partnerships which creates their own


1237
01:00:37.300 --> 01:00:40.600
volatility here because they start resenting their partner.


1238
01:00:41.500 --> 01:00:44.300
They they're looking for intimacy and something long-term. But


1239
01:00:44.300 --> 01:00:47.100
at the same time because they have no identity at that point


1240
01:00:47.100 --> 01:00:51.300
Pluto's coming in Pluto is volatility and


1241
01:00:51.300 --> 01:00:54.000
whatnot, and it is squaring Venus. So it's creating.


1242
01:00:55.600 --> 01:00:58.600
Probably public because Saturns here


1243
01:00:58.600 --> 01:01:01.600
public and also the moon


1244
01:01:01.600 --> 01:01:05.600
here privately public outbursts within


1245
01:01:05.600 --> 01:01:08.000
relationships that are here because it's the first


1246
01:01:08.300 --> 01:01:10.900
house it is them that is causing the issue.


1247
01:01:12.600 --> 01:01:13.800
Usually not the partner.


1248
01:01:14.500 --> 01:01:17.300
Because the partners involved in the that's not to say the partner didn't


1249
01:01:17.300 --> 01:01:20.400
do anything but it's them that creates the turbulence.


1250
01:01:21.400 --> 01:01:24.900
So that's what we know about their romance and the relationships now


1251
01:01:24.900 --> 01:01:26.700
we're going I hope you guys are following along.


1252
01:01:27.400 --> 01:01:30.600
Now we're going to go up to the eighth house because for me in love


1253
01:01:30.600 --> 01:01:33.400
relationships, I can look at everything. I can look at your friendships within


1254
01:01:33.400 --> 01:01:36.000
relationships, which is up in the 11th house. I can look at


1255
01:01:36.300 --> 01:01:39.700
again public we talked about in this person that they're they're


1256
01:01:39.700 --> 01:01:42.400
career and their Public Image is all related


1257
01:01:42.400 --> 01:01:45.200
into their romance, not directly into


1258
01:01:45.200 --> 01:01:47.600
their relationship, but the romance aspect of it.


1259
01:01:49.100 --> 01:01:49.400
the beginning


1260
01:01:50.500 --> 01:01:51.200
intimacy


1261
01:01:52.200 --> 01:01:55.300
For love readings. I do five seven eight. I read


1262
01:01:55.300 --> 01:01:58.600
the entire chart but five seven eight, excuse me is my


1263
01:01:58.600 --> 01:02:01.300
that's what I focus on right because for


1264
01:02:01.300 --> 01:02:04.600
me love is Romance the


1265
01:02:04.600 --> 01:02:07.600
actual relationship and connection and how they interact and


1266
01:02:07.600 --> 01:02:10.700
then the intimacy from there I jump around because


1267
01:02:10.700 --> 01:02:13.200
everything else is important included but those are the


1268
01:02:13.200 --> 01:02:17.000
main three aspects intimacy is probably one of


1269
01:02:16.400 --> 01:02:19.500
the most difficult things to explain


1270
01:02:19.500 --> 01:02:21.500
to my my clients and customers


1271
01:02:22.500 --> 01:02:26.400
And is probably the most consistent issue


1272
01:02:25.400 --> 01:02:29.000
within all love relationship


1273
01:02:28.800 --> 01:02:31.000
readings that I do


1274
01:02:31.500 --> 01:02:34.700
when there's a problem going on or if they're looking to somehow make


1275
01:02:34.700 --> 01:02:37.500
their relationship better. This person is no


1276
01:02:37.500 --> 01:02:37.700
different.


1277
01:02:39.700 --> 01:02:42.400
Chiron Chiron is always a very difficult thing to


1278
01:02:42.400 --> 01:02:42.700
deal with.


1279
01:02:43.800 --> 01:02:46.400
Some people have it worse or harder than others because


1280
01:02:46.400 --> 01:02:49.300
of potential negative aspects.


1281
01:02:50.200 --> 01:02:53.600
Sometimes trines like this person has a Trine


1282
01:02:53.600 --> 01:02:56.300
here can actually make it more difficult because everything that happens


1283
01:02:56.300 --> 01:02:58.400
within the relationship actually activate.


1284
01:03:00.300 --> 01:03:03.100
Sometimes in a positive way, but can be negative. If there is a


1285
01:03:03.100 --> 01:03:07.000
Transit happening to this. It'll actually affect from deep


1286
01:03:06.500 --> 01:03:08.900
within the relationship externally.


1287
01:03:09.700 --> 01:03:12.500
This person Chiron in Taurus is self-worth issues.


1288
01:03:12.500 --> 01:03:16.100
It is value issues. It is money issues with shared resources,


1289
01:03:15.100 --> 01:03:18.400
but we're not talking about shared resources. We're


1290
01:03:18.400 --> 01:03:21.700
not talking about business, right? The lens is love


1291
01:03:21.700 --> 01:03:23.600
now. I catch myself doing this all the time.


1292
01:03:24.700 --> 01:03:27.500
Sometimes I've got to get myself back to what


1293
01:03:27.500 --> 01:03:30.800
was the lens again. And this is where it can be confusing and


1294
01:03:30.800 --> 01:03:33.900
this is where when you do natal chart readings. Those are


1295
01:03:33.900 --> 01:03:36.700
very difficult because you have no lens if you're


1296
01:03:36.700 --> 01:03:39.200
trying to read somebody's natal chart. What are we talking


1297
01:03:39.200 --> 01:03:42.300
about? What's the first house? What's the Eighth House in the scope


1298
01:03:42.300 --> 01:03:45.300
of what so it doesn't matter how long you spend on a natal chart


1299
01:03:45.300 --> 01:03:48.200
reading you're never going to give them all the information which is why there's


1300
01:03:48.200 --> 01:03:49.300
always questions at the end.


1301
01:03:50.400 --> 01:03:50.700
Let's continue.


1302
01:03:51.600 --> 01:03:54.300
Like I said shared Resources with money issues here.


1303
01:03:55.100 --> 01:03:58.400
Debt issues whatever but none of that has to do with love. So


1304
01:03:58.400 --> 01:04:02.000
erase that what does it have to do with intimacy? Okay self-worth


1305
01:04:01.300 --> 01:04:04.600
within intimacy Chiron and it's


1306
01:04:04.600 --> 01:04:07.400
in retrograde so that that wound is internal


1307
01:04:07.400 --> 01:04:10.600
and it needs to be cured internally. Now, I'm not going to go through Chiron


1308
01:04:10.600 --> 01:04:13.000
and what it means too much in this class because that's not what it's about.


1309
01:04:13.600 --> 01:04:16.700
But we know that it's it's issues and insecurities


1310
01:04:16.700 --> 01:04:19.400
and it can manifest in the real world. A lot of times. It's


1311
01:04:19.400 --> 01:04:22.200
psychological and it comes from childhood. Now with


1312
01:04:22.200 --> 01:04:25.400
this person. It is in the Eighth House of intimacy. It is in Taurus


1313
01:04:25.400 --> 01:04:28.000
Taurus rule by Venus Venus is in the fourth house now.


1314
01:04:29.200 --> 01:04:32.200
We already did the seventh house. We did the fifth house when I break


1315
01:04:32.200 --> 01:04:35.200
this down first, and I know that there are insecurity issues which


1316
01:04:35.200 --> 01:04:39.100
means this person has a very difficult time getting Beyond


1317
01:04:38.100 --> 01:04:41.800
romance and the relationship. This


1318
01:04:41.800 --> 01:04:44.700
person has a really tough time actually connecting


1319
01:04:44.700 --> 01:04:47.700
on a very deep level in a


1320
01:04:47.700 --> 01:04:49.800
value-oriented way and essential way.


1321
01:04:51.100 --> 01:04:54.500
With a partner and it comes from issues from


1322
01:04:54.500 --> 01:04:58.000
within within their own value within their own sexuality because


1323
01:04:57.700 --> 01:05:01.100
sexuality rules the eighth house as a woman their


1324
01:05:00.100 --> 01:05:01.800
own Womanhood.


1325
01:05:02.500 --> 01:05:06.200
Which they may not have an issue with outwardly but inwardly


1326
01:05:05.200 --> 01:05:08.400
because it's the Eighth House deep down


1327
01:05:08.400 --> 01:05:11.600
secretly. They absolutely do now Chiron can


1328
01:05:11.600 --> 01:05:14.700
also create overcompensation. Right? We have


1329
01:05:14.700 --> 01:05:17.100
this wound so much that sometimes in the


1330
01:05:17.100 --> 01:05:20.200
opposite context we put it out there. So this person may


1331
01:05:21.200 --> 01:05:25.100
end up having such issues with


1332
01:05:24.100 --> 01:05:27.500
their insecurities within their self-worth and value


1333
01:05:27.500 --> 01:05:30.800
as a woman feminine energy, especially in nitpicking


1334
01:05:30.800 --> 01:05:32.900
themselves here because it's in Virgo.


1335
01:05:33.700 --> 01:05:36.600
And how they could serve in the bedroom potentially


1336
01:05:36.600 --> 01:05:39.100
intimately that they may overcompensate and


1337
01:05:39.100 --> 01:05:42.600
take their sexuality outwardly to try to prove themselves


1338
01:05:42.600 --> 01:05:45.400
as somebody who is sexy or somebody that has sex


1339
01:05:45.400 --> 01:05:48.400
appeal even though once they get in the bedroom. It becomes a


1340
01:05:48.400 --> 01:05:51.200
huge issue. That's one thing. We don't talk about enough with


1341
01:05:51.200 --> 01:05:54.500
Chiron is the overcompensation which actually highlights the


1342
01:05:54.500 --> 01:05:57.300
wound even more if you pay attention now.


1343
01:05:58.300 --> 01:06:01.200
19 degrees we kind of talked about Chiron at 19 degrees


1344
01:06:01.200 --> 01:06:04.200
we look we do a quick scan around the chart and see


1345
01:06:04.200 --> 01:06:06.900
what we see chiron's very small so


1346
01:06:07.700 --> 01:06:11.100
in terms of how Chiron is impacting other planets, I


1347
01:06:10.100 --> 01:06:13.400
would say 18 to 20 degrees and


1348
01:06:14.600 --> 01:06:17.900
We have 19 right here. Now. This is interesting. This


1349
01:06:17.900 --> 01:06:20.900
Chiron is in conjunct Saturn.


1350
01:06:20.900 --> 01:06:23.400
So this person is a hard worker.


1351
01:06:23.400 --> 01:06:26.300
We know that here which isn't really the lens of


1352
01:06:26.300 --> 01:06:29.500
love, but we know their hard worker in terms of lens of Love. They actually want


1353
01:06:29.500 --> 01:06:31.600
a this is what they need.


1354
01:06:32.800 --> 01:06:35.300
They need Independence, but they need a


1355
01:06:35.300 --> 01:06:38.200
partner that is their best friend that is


1356
01:06:38.200 --> 01:06:41.300
long-term a little bit of a traditionalist and that


1357
01:06:41.300 --> 01:06:43.600
there is an intimate connection with this person.


1358
01:06:44.500 --> 01:06:47.300
Where value and money and shared resources are all part


1359
01:06:47.300 --> 01:06:50.200
of this and there are no problems in that realm. This is what


1360
01:06:50.200 --> 01:06:52.100
that person needs. It's in the first and second house.


1361
01:06:53.200 --> 01:06:55.400
They're sending it two degrees. We'll talk about separately.


1362
01:06:57.500 --> 01:07:00.500
In the context of love, but this is what they need in


1363
01:07:00.500 --> 01:07:01.700
terms of Love. They want a partner.


1364
01:07:02.700 --> 01:07:05.500
And a lot of Libra risings, they identify with a


1365
01:07:05.500 --> 01:07:09.800
partner and that's kind of their default. The Aries in


1366
01:07:08.800 --> 01:07:11.400
terms of relationships tends to


1367
01:07:11.400 --> 01:07:15.100
make them very selfish with their partner and not attend


1368
01:07:14.100 --> 01:07:17.200
to their needs but it's rulers in the 12th. So


1369
01:07:17.200 --> 01:07:20.700
in Virgo, so there is a service there. It's just behind the scenes back


1370
01:07:20.700 --> 01:07:23.400
to the Eighth House of intimacy that in conjunction


1371
01:07:23.400 --> 01:07:25.500
means that they're their long-term.


1372
01:07:26.300 --> 01:07:29.100
They feet and which is interesting because Pluto's here. So this makes it


1373
01:07:29.100 --> 01:07:32.700
complicated because Pluto rules the eighth house, which is more intimacy. So


1374
01:07:32.700 --> 01:07:34.200
they need and want intimacy here.


1375
01:07:35.100 --> 01:07:38.200
But they compartmentalize it because they have their wounds. So


1376
01:07:38.200 --> 01:07:41.700
they're wound and their inability to dive deep in their overcompensation of


1377
01:07:41.700 --> 01:07:44.400
their sexuality. They actually hold separately.


1378
01:07:45.300 --> 01:07:48.300
From the relationship that they want


1379
01:07:48.300 --> 01:07:51.800
so they actually don't merge those two together that intimacy


1380
01:07:51.800 --> 01:07:54.300
is not for relationships this relationship. This


1381
01:07:54.300 --> 01:07:57.300
intimacy is for some Partners, but


1382
01:07:57.300 --> 01:08:00.400
not the one and this is what can create a


1383
01:08:00.400 --> 01:08:01.300
very difficult.


1384
01:08:02.800 --> 01:08:05.200
Issue within someone like


1385
01:08:05.200 --> 01:08:08.100
this when you're doing love readings is they that these two


1386
01:08:08.100 --> 01:08:11.300
energies cannot be merged not in a standard way anyway, because


1387
01:08:11.300 --> 01:08:14.200
an in conjunction means that these energies don't understand each other.


1388
01:08:14.200 --> 01:08:17.400
What complicates this reading is that Pluto which


1389
01:08:17.400 --> 01:08:21.600
rules the same thing is there practically conjunct.


1390
01:08:20.600 --> 01:08:23.100
It's conjunct in terms of Saturn.


1391
01:08:24.100 --> 01:08:27.700
Saturn seven degree seven to seven and a half degree orb is


1392
01:08:27.700 --> 01:08:29.400
definitely reaching over Pluto.


1393
01:08:30.200 --> 01:08:33.500
So this person needs intimacy one intimacy


1394
01:08:33.500 --> 01:08:36.500
and can have intimacy but not when it comes to their wound.


1395
01:08:36.500 --> 01:08:39.400
They treat their wound. They don't deal with their wound


1396
01:08:39.400 --> 01:08:42.700
within their relationship. They don't let their partner in to heal


1397
01:08:42.700 --> 01:08:45.100
themselves. So this intimacy that they do


1398
01:08:45.100 --> 01:08:48.500
have is for the sake of the partner because it's the first house in


1399
01:08:48.500 --> 01:08:49.000
Libra.


1400
01:08:49.500 --> 01:08:52.400
It's intimacy for the sake of intimacy, but their


1401
01:08:52.400 --> 01:08:55.700
true intimacy and their Eighth House and their wounds are hidden


1402
01:08:55.700 --> 01:08:58.000
to themselves and their partner has nothing to do with it.


1403
01:08:59.400 --> 01:09:02.500
What's interesting though is an in conjunction can actually exacerbate the


1404
01:09:02.500 --> 01:09:05.300
other one. So this intimacy can make


1405
01:09:05.300 --> 01:09:08.300
this wound worse. This wound can make this intimacy not happen.


1406
01:09:09.300 --> 01:09:12.400
So they are linked there has to be a creative way to resolve


1407
01:09:12.400 --> 01:09:15.400
this and this and this does require this is not in


1408
01:09:15.400 --> 01:09:18.400
the context of love. But when you expand out this does


1409
01:09:18.400 --> 01:09:21.000
require that somebody gets a little bit of therapy.


1410
01:09:21.600 --> 01:09:24.500
because they have self-worth issues within intimacy within


1411
01:09:24.500 --> 01:09:27.300
things that are deep down in private that no one else knows


1412
01:09:27.300 --> 01:09:27.500
about


1413
01:09:28.400 --> 01:09:31.500
that have to do with the fourth house fourth house


1414
01:09:31.500 --> 01:09:34.100
is what mother Capricorn Authority from the


1415
01:09:34.100 --> 01:09:37.500
mother their relationship relationship with the mother


1416
01:09:37.500 --> 01:09:40.500
which we didn't talk about and potentially the father


1417
01:09:40.500 --> 01:09:43.300
as well because we do have a link between the mother and


1418
01:09:43.300 --> 01:09:45.400
the father with this opposition here.


1419
01:09:47.900 --> 01:09:50.300
And a few other things so we have


1420
01:09:50.300 --> 01:09:53.200
family issues in general. It's an idea


1421
01:09:53.200 --> 01:09:56.300
the fourth house represents family and so does the moon so it's


1422
01:09:56.300 --> 01:09:59.600
not just the mother. It's not just the father but it's the family dynamic as


1423
01:09:59.600 --> 01:10:02.800
a whole has put in a damper on


1424
01:10:02.800 --> 01:10:05.200
this person's relationships because they're trying so


1425
01:10:05.200 --> 01:10:08.400
desperately not to have the relationship that their parents had.


1426
01:10:11.400 --> 01:10:14.300
I'm wondering how many you guys have kept up


1427
01:10:14.300 --> 01:10:16.700
with me at this point and


1428
01:10:18.300 --> 01:10:22.000
and get everything that I've said the intimacy


1429
01:10:21.300 --> 01:10:24.200
again has to do with this and we know that this


1430
01:10:24.200 --> 01:10:27.400
squares off with Pluto. So there this is


1431
01:10:27.400 --> 01:10:28.400
and this is in the first house.


1432
01:10:29.600 --> 01:10:32.300
So their idea of a relationship.


1433
01:10:33.500 --> 01:10:36.600
Is in contrast conflict with


1434
01:10:36.600 --> 01:10:39.500
their parents relationship and that's where a


1435
01:10:39.500 --> 01:10:42.200
lot of their intimacy issues come from because something that


1436
01:10:42.200 --> 01:10:43.700
they personally witnessed.


1437
01:10:44.400 --> 01:10:47.500
Potentially the divorce because that's right here their


1438
01:10:47.500 --> 01:10:50.400
family Pluto is and Libra. This


1439
01:10:50.400 --> 01:10:53.300
is relationship. This is divorce. So I'm assuming that


1440
01:10:53.300 --> 01:10:56.700
this person would have had their parents


1441
01:10:56.700 --> 01:10:59.400
would have divorced earlier life and


1442
01:10:59.400 --> 01:11:00.900
probably around two years old.


1443
01:11:01.900 --> 01:11:04.700
Because their sentence at two this is when they came in


1444
01:11:04.700 --> 01:11:07.300
the term of relationships. This is when they came online.


1445
01:11:08.600 --> 01:11:11.600
Something interesting that I found. I don't know how many people have noticed this


1446
01:11:11.600 --> 01:11:14.100
but the ascendant degree is your on switch.


1447
01:11:15.100 --> 01:11:18.100
It's not to say that you weren't living before that. It's not to say that


1448
01:11:18.100 --> 01:11:18.700
you weren't.


1449
01:11:19.700 --> 01:11:22.700
Alive or paying attention but this


1450
01:11:22.700 --> 01:11:25.100
is when you start coming into you into who you


1451
01:11:25.100 --> 01:11:28.400
are who you're going to be and this pushes you forward. Now.


1452
01:11:28.400 --> 01:11:31.400
I want I'm going to answer this question that I'm looking up here in


1453
01:11:31.400 --> 01:11:32.200
a second, but I want to


1454
01:11:33.200 --> 01:11:36.500
stop here for a second. We have only talked


1455
01:11:36.500 --> 01:11:39.700
about love in the lenses of


1456
01:11:39.700 --> 01:11:40.500
romance.


1457
01:11:41.600 --> 01:11:44.300
The actual relationship and first marriage


1458
01:11:44.300 --> 01:11:47.800
and intimacy. We haven't Dove deep deep


1459
01:11:47.800 --> 01:11:50.500
into any of them semi-deep into


1460
01:11:50.500 --> 01:11:53.100
all three and this system that I


1461
01:11:53.100 --> 01:11:55.400
developed in the way that I read is why?


1462
01:11:56.700 --> 01:12:00.100
You are going to read better and


1463
01:11:59.100 --> 01:12:02.600
differently than everyone else and people


1464
01:12:02.600 --> 01:12:05.300
are going to be like, I don't know how you know that


1465
01:12:05.300 --> 01:12:08.900
the thing is you don't know anything going


1466
01:12:08.900 --> 01:12:10.400
in you see a chart.


1467
01:12:11.200 --> 01:12:14.800
And you break it apart and this is what it comes down to break


1468
01:12:14.800 --> 01:12:17.200
it apart take it one thing at a time


1469
01:12:17.200 --> 01:12:20.900
add information just keep adding information. And


1470
01:12:20.900 --> 01:12:23.500
as you add information you have developed a narrative


1471
01:12:23.500 --> 01:12:25.100
if you've ever read a novel.


1472
01:12:25.900 --> 01:12:28.200
You know, you can't just look at this thing about. Oh, yeah, you're


1473
01:12:28.200 --> 01:12:31.200
this and just walk away. No, you got to build it


1474
01:12:31.200 --> 01:12:34.300
up. You're building a character bio in a novel. If you've read any


1475
01:12:34.300 --> 01:12:37.200
novel when you get the page 10, you still don't know anything about this


1476
01:12:37.200 --> 01:12:40.200
character. That's what astrology is in order


1477
01:12:40.200 --> 01:12:43.800
to get dive into this into everything here, especially personality.


1478
01:12:43.800 --> 01:12:46.500
You've got to dive in layer by layer


1479
01:12:46.500 --> 01:12:49.200
structure by structure piece by piece and look at


1480
01:12:49.200 --> 01:12:52.800
every single thing that has to do with this ruler. It's placement


1481
01:12:52.800 --> 01:12:55.200
the aspects and that's how you


1482
01:12:55.200 --> 01:12:56.400
get all your information because


1483
01:12:57.400 --> 01:13:00.400
The aspects will tell you yes, this is good


1484
01:13:00.400 --> 01:13:03.300
or there's a conflict. No, this is bad


1485
01:13:03.300 --> 01:13:06.100
and that tells you oh, okay. Well, it can't be


1486
01:13:06.100 --> 01:13:10.000
a good thing. So how would that play out in a bad way? Well conflict struggle


1487
01:13:09.400 --> 01:13:10.600
Strife, whatever.


1488
01:13:12.200 --> 01:13:15.400
It's definitely a ton of information but it makes complete


1489
01:13:15.400 --> 01:13:18.100
sense. I can't wait for this recording to be uploaded so I could slow it


1490
01:13:18.100 --> 01:13:21.300
down and look at my chart again and break it down. That's what I'm hoping. You guys do


1491
01:13:21.300 --> 01:13:24.000
I'm hoping you start clicking because the best


1492
01:13:24.200 --> 01:13:24.600
thing you can do.


1493
01:13:25.500 --> 01:13:26.100
is to


1494
01:13:29.600 --> 01:13:32.800
the best thing you can do is to go back to your own chart and try


1495
01:13:32.800 --> 01:13:35.200
to look at it. We know we're in whole science. We know all the


1496
01:13:35.200 --> 01:13:38.200
systems because you're taking classes one through three and now you're breaking it


1497
01:13:38.200 --> 01:13:39.300
down. You're tying it together.


1498
01:13:40.100 --> 01:13:43.600
and you're starting to analyze yourself objectively not what


1499
01:13:43.600 --> 01:13:46.100
you're taking a little bit of what you know, but you're not trying not to


1500
01:13:46.100 --> 01:13:47.500
be subjective about it and like


1501
01:13:48.100 --> 01:13:51.500
This is not about making the chart fit you. It's about understanding


1502
01:13:51.500 --> 01:13:54.300
yourself because here's the energies that you've worked with and this


1503
01:13:54.300 --> 01:13:57.200
is why things have played out if you try to go subjectively and


1504
01:13:58.100 --> 01:14:01.200
And say I want it to work. It's impossible to Manifest. This is


1505
01:14:01.200 --> 01:14:04.100
why people who do who are always like.


1506
01:14:04.100 --> 01:14:07.300
Well, I want placidus as the best my classes doesn't work.


1507
01:14:07.300 --> 01:14:10.800
And then they keep fighting me. I'm like fine use placidus, but you're


1508
01:14:10.800 --> 01:14:13.200
never gonna manifest anything because everything's gonna be hit or


1509
01:14:13.200 --> 01:14:16.100
miss right? It's the same thing with the same with the people who


1510
01:14:16.100 --> 01:14:16.500
are like well,


1511
01:14:17.500 --> 01:14:20.300
I want it to be in this house and I wanted to mean this. Well,


1512
01:14:20.300 --> 01:14:24.000
it doesn't mean that and if you keep like dwelling


1513
01:14:23.300 --> 01:14:26.500
on it wanting to mean something it will


1514
01:14:26.500 --> 01:14:29.300
you'll never be able to use it properly. The next class is literally


1515
01:14:29.300 --> 01:14:32.200
about saying if you really want that just know what it means in the


1516
01:14:32.200 --> 01:14:33.900
first place so you can make it be what you want.


1517
01:14:34.800 --> 01:14:37.200
Or if there's capacity for


1518
01:14:37.200 --> 01:14:38.100
it, but that's next class.


1519
01:14:39.200 --> 01:14:41.100
But I'm excited to see how you guys.


1520
01:14:43.400 --> 01:14:46.200
How you guys resonate with it? Once you do start looking into your own


1521
01:14:46.200 --> 01:14:49.600
charts to see once you start breaking down everything again through


1522
01:14:49.600 --> 01:14:52.200
lenses because everything is through a


1523
01:14:52.200 --> 01:14:55.500
lens. There's too much information here to not be breaking it


1524
01:14:55.500 --> 01:14:58.200
down into the context of what are we talking about? This is the


1525
01:14:58.200 --> 01:15:01.900
theme this is the topic. I'm not looking at anything else just this.


1526
01:15:04.600 --> 01:15:05.500
So Ashley, let me know.


1527
01:15:07.300 --> 01:15:07.600
You know.


1528
01:15:08.800 --> 01:15:11.200
You know what topic you start with and what you find


1529
01:15:11.200 --> 01:15:14.300
out maybe something new that you didn't really understand before.


1530
01:15:15.900 --> 01:15:18.400
Taylor I had something come up that's why


1531
01:15:18.400 --> 01:15:21.500
I'm late in case you're wondering why someone was asking a thousand questions. You probably


1532
01:15:21.500 --> 01:15:24.600
gonna be asking a thousand questions now because you missed a big chunk


1533
01:15:24.600 --> 01:15:27.600
of the beginning but try


1534
01:15:27.600 --> 01:15:31.000
to follow along and you'll get the recording anyway, so stay


1535
01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:31.200
tuned.


1536
01:15:33.400 --> 01:15:34.000
Ashley I was able


1537
01:15:36.500 --> 01:15:39.900
I was I was able to something of breakdown my


1538
01:15:39.900 --> 01:15:42.200
passed away grandmother's chart with just the


1539
01:15:42.200 --> 01:15:42.800
first three classes.


1540
01:15:43.800 --> 01:15:44.300
That's awesome.


1541
01:15:46.100 --> 01:15:50.000
That's awesome. I'm glad that okay, so it's working. It's


1542
01:15:49.400 --> 01:15:52.700
working if you're able to do more


1543
01:15:52.700 --> 01:15:55.300
than you were before then it's working if you've


1544
01:15:55.300 --> 01:15:58.300
been into astrology and this is helped you at least start breaking


1545
01:15:58.300 --> 01:16:00.200
down some things that is


1546
01:16:01.300 --> 01:16:04.400
Amazing. Yes. My great aunt confirmed. It was spot-on.


1547
01:16:04.400 --> 01:16:06.600
Look at you. Look at you go.


1548
01:16:07.200 --> 01:16:11.400
I'm telling you we're creating a whole world of astrologers.


1549
01:16:10.400 --> 01:16:13.300
It might be a small world because not everybody's into


1550
01:16:13.300 --> 01:16:16.100
astrology but you guys are going to be able to do amazing things with your


1551
01:16:16.100 --> 01:16:19.600
life. It's gonna be awesome. Some of you guys want to learn astrology


1552
01:16:19.600 --> 01:16:20.800
because you want to teach astrology.


1553
01:16:21.600 --> 01:16:24.300
You want to dive deeper you want a good foundation to


1554
01:16:24.300 --> 01:16:27.300
kind of figure out, you know, your own stuff. Some of


1555
01:16:27.300 --> 01:16:30.600
you guys are doing it because you want to be astrologers and


1556
01:16:30.600 --> 01:16:33.300
you want to help other people all that's awesome. I think the majority of


1557
01:16:33.300 --> 01:16:37.100
people just want to understand their own lives so that they can stop seeing certain


1558
01:16:36.100 --> 01:16:39.400
Cycles happen and really manifest for


1559
01:16:39.400 --> 01:16:42.200
themselves, which is why this whole course is here all thanks to


1560
01:16:42.200 --> 01:16:43.200
you. Thank you.


1561
01:16:44.600 --> 01:16:47.300
Well, thanks to you for showing up and taking this


1562
01:16:47.300 --> 01:16:50.300
information and applying it because without that it


1563
01:16:50.300 --> 01:16:53.100
really doesn't matter. I could sit here and talk at the wall, I guess


1564
01:16:53.100 --> 01:16:56.500
so, that's awesome. Not all me. You too.


1565
01:16:57.200 --> 01:17:00.400
Let's keep going. That's awesome raising my confidence mid


1566
01:17:00.400 --> 01:17:01.400
class. I love it.


1567
01:17:03.200 --> 01:17:07.300
Okay, so we talked about love for this person. I was


1568
01:17:07.300 --> 01:17:10.300
thinking I was going to go through I have three charts. I was thinking I was going to go through all


1569
01:17:10.300 --> 01:17:10.700
three.


1570
01:17:11.700 --> 01:17:14.200
What I'm going to do is I'm going to go through.


1571
01:17:17.400 --> 01:17:20.100
I'm just gonna leave this one at love. I'm gonna go to the next


1572
01:17:20.100 --> 01:17:20.600
chart.


1573
01:17:21.700 --> 01:17:24.400
And then I'm going to the final one because I don't have enough time


1574
01:17:24.400 --> 01:17:27.200
to keep doing all of these. So we talked about love here.


1575
01:17:27.200 --> 01:17:28.400
I'm gonna go to chart two.


1576
01:17:29.400 --> 01:17:30.000
chart two


1577
01:17:31.600 --> 01:17:35.600
Um this I'm going to talk about their family


1578
01:17:34.600 --> 01:17:37.200
right people ask about


1579
01:17:37.200 --> 01:17:40.200
their family their home life and family all the


1580
01:17:40.200 --> 01:17:43.300
time and I can do that here. So I'm not


1581
01:17:43.300 --> 01:17:46.100
gonna worry about career. I'm not going to


1582
01:17:46.100 --> 01:17:49.100
worry about relationships. I'm not


1583
01:17:49.100 --> 01:17:52.100
going to worry about love. I'm not gonna worry about that. What I am


1584
01:17:52.100 --> 01:17:55.400
going to do is we're gonna switch gears right new chart


1585
01:17:55.400 --> 01:17:56.000
new information.


1586
01:17:57.600 --> 01:18:00.300
And we're starting fresh. This is client. Number two.


1587
01:18:00.300 --> 01:18:03.200
We've done a reading we've given answers if you're


1588
01:18:03.200 --> 01:18:06.100
an astrologer, then you know, you've gotten paid for


1589
01:18:06.100 --> 01:18:09.300
your services you have received compensation for


1590
01:18:09.300 --> 01:18:12.400
your time energy value knowledge. They have received


1591
01:18:12.400 --> 01:18:15.700
answers that they so desperately needed and can either get


1592
01:18:15.700 --> 01:18:17.600
closure Clarity do something.


1593
01:18:18.700 --> 01:18:21.400
It's amazing. It's a win-win in this type


1594
01:18:21.400 --> 01:18:21.400
of


1595
01:18:22.200 --> 01:18:25.300
Arena so now we're on to a new client. This new client


1596
01:18:25.300 --> 01:18:27.000
comes in. They want to know about their family.


1597
01:18:27.700 --> 01:18:30.300
I'm not gonna dive into the entire family. I'm not


1598
01:18:30.300 --> 01:18:33.300
gonna worry about money. I'm not gonna worry about too much of who they are. I'm


1599
01:18:33.300 --> 01:18:36.900
gonna like, you know, when I it makes me think of there


1600
01:18:36.900 --> 01:18:39.300
used to be the these like little they weren't kaleidoscopes. They're


1601
01:18:39.300 --> 01:18:42.600
like little binocular things that you would see a story in them


1602
01:18:42.600 --> 01:18:45.700
and they had this like thing that you put in front and


1603
01:18:45.700 --> 01:18:48.100
then you would take it out and you put another one in front


1604
01:18:48.100 --> 01:18:51.200
and it would be a different story each time. That's what I think of


1605
01:18:51.200 --> 01:18:53.900
when I see lenses. That's why I called it lenses to begin with


1606
01:18:54.900 --> 01:18:57.600
So we're gonna look at this person again not career


1607
01:18:57.600 --> 01:19:00.500
not love but family. So


1608
01:19:00.500 --> 01:19:03.400
we're gonna talk about family here. So again each one


1609
01:19:03.400 --> 01:19:06.100
of these houses is still important. I'm just


1610
01:19:06.100 --> 01:19:09.100
going to go to the traditional ones because


1611
01:19:10.100 --> 01:19:13.200
I have a certain amount of time that I have to read this. I'm not


1612
01:19:13.200 --> 01:19:16.100
trying to spend seven years on this person's chart and I'm gonna give


1613
01:19:16.100 --> 01:19:19.400
them as much information as possible within the time frame or within the context


1614
01:19:19.400 --> 01:19:22.500
of the question. Now, it makes it easier when they ask a question because I


1615
01:19:22.500 --> 01:19:25.200
don't need to look at all 12 houses. I need to look at what they're


1616
01:19:25.200 --> 01:19:28.400
talking about. You always want to break down their question. Let's


1617
01:19:28.400 --> 01:19:31.400
try to question on this one because I don't need to know about all their cousins


1618
01:19:31.400 --> 01:19:32.900
Aunts Uncles grandparents or whatever.


1619
01:19:33.900 --> 01:19:34.400
Let's say


1620
01:19:35.900 --> 01:19:39.800
Oh Lord, let's say


1621
01:19:39.800 --> 01:19:40.600
children.


1622
01:19:41.500 --> 01:19:44.300
What's my relationship with my first child? That's something


1623
01:19:44.300 --> 01:19:47.000
I do a lot. Actually I do children's charts all the time.


1624
01:19:47.800 --> 01:19:50.500
So this person wants to know about their first child and


1625
01:19:50.500 --> 01:19:51.400
children in general.


1626
01:19:52.300 --> 01:19:52.500
now


1627
01:19:54.600 --> 01:19:57.600
I already see Chiron in here. So I know there's a heavy


1628
01:19:57.600 --> 01:19:59.100
influence on.


1629
01:20:01.400 --> 01:20:04.400
This fifth house so lucky me I


1630
01:20:04.400 --> 01:20:07.300
chose that without glancing here first. So I'm still gonna


1631
01:20:07.300 --> 01:20:09.400
answer that question and we're going to talk about it here.


1632
01:20:10.200 --> 01:20:13.200
now all of these houses mean something when it comes


1633
01:20:13.200 --> 01:20:16.200
to the context of children when you link it in this is


1634
01:20:16.200 --> 01:20:19.800
their health which can impact children if there's some sort of influence I


1635
01:20:19.800 --> 01:20:20.700
do see that there is


1636
01:20:22.500 --> 01:20:25.200
Children in Pisces. So that's something that will will come back


1637
01:20:25.200 --> 01:20:28.100
to this is their one-to-one relationships which may have to do


1638
01:20:28.100 --> 01:20:31.200
with children. It's how they deal with everybody. But this is


1639
01:20:31.200 --> 01:20:34.300
more specific to children in the fifth house. This is also the first child.


1640
01:20:34.300 --> 01:20:35.400
This is the second child.


1641
01:20:37.600 --> 01:20:40.800
Third child would be up here. This is them as a father. This is


1642
01:20:40.800 --> 01:20:43.000
them as a mother. Yes, we can be


1643
01:20:43.800 --> 01:20:46.200
Mothers and Fathers as men Mothers and Fathers as


1644
01:20:46.200 --> 01:20:46.900
women you


1645
01:20:47.700 --> 01:20:50.500
father your child differently than you mother


1646
01:20:50.500 --> 01:20:53.400
your child even as a woman and I


1647
01:20:53.400 --> 01:20:53.600
think


1648
01:20:54.800 --> 01:20:57.300
Society has has gotten us into a


1649
01:20:57.300 --> 01:20:58.600
certain point where we're so gender.


1650
01:21:00.500 --> 01:21:03.300
I don't have gender oriented or gender disillusioned is


1651
01:21:03.300 --> 01:21:07.400
the right term these days but now male


1652
01:21:06.400 --> 01:21:09.300
and female energy are the two energies. There is


1653
01:21:09.300 --> 01:21:12.900
no third energy and we the yin


1654
01:21:12.900 --> 01:21:15.600
and yang concept exists and


1655
01:21:15.600 --> 01:21:19.100
I'm not talking about genders. I'm just talking about energy. I'm


1656
01:21:18.100 --> 01:21:22.100
not getting into that not talking about politics, but the


1657
01:21:21.100 --> 01:21:24.100
actual energies male and female. That's all


1658
01:21:24.100 --> 01:21:26.600
there is there's the the Opposites there's the


1659
01:21:27.600 --> 01:21:30.300
You know the Mars versus Venus, that's all there


1660
01:21:30.300 --> 01:21:30.400
is.


1661
01:21:31.300 --> 01:21:34.200
So when you're looking at these energies here your father,


1662
01:21:34.200 --> 01:21:36.500
but also how you father your mother how you mother.


1663
01:21:37.200 --> 01:21:40.300
What you value how you communicate and


1664
01:21:40.300 --> 01:21:44.400
how it could be linked, right? So these are all LinkedIn. So we're true. We're


1665
01:21:43.400 --> 01:21:47.300
looking at this person Rebel Academy


1666
01:21:47.300 --> 01:21:50.300
sample two in the context of


1667
01:21:50.300 --> 01:21:53.400
the relationship with the first child and their children


1668
01:21:53.400 --> 01:21:54.000
in general.


1669
01:21:55.300 --> 01:21:55.500
So


1670
01:21:56.300 --> 01:21:56.900
I'm going to start.


1671
01:21:57.800 --> 01:22:00.200
You know stereotypically with the first I'm sorry


1672
01:22:00.200 --> 01:22:00.900
with the fifth house.


1673
01:22:01.600 --> 01:22:05.300
A lot going on here. Like I said, including Chiron my


1674
01:22:04.300 --> 01:22:07.100
first instinct because I work with


1675
01:22:07.100 --> 01:22:09.900
Chiron moon in Pluto is I want to know


1676
01:22:10.800 --> 01:22:14.000
Before I dive into anything what's going


1677
01:22:13.300 --> 01:22:16.100
on with this Chiron right now? I know


1678
01:22:16.100 --> 01:22:19.200
I keep saying over and over that. This class is not about Chiron, but


1679
01:22:19.200 --> 01:22:19.900
I want to know.


1680
01:22:21.100 --> 01:22:24.700
In what capacity is the insecurity inability limitation


1681
01:22:24.700 --> 01:22:27.600
or otherwise happening the wound?


1682
01:22:27.600 --> 01:22:28.600
What is the wound?


1683
01:22:29.500 --> 01:22:34.500
Again, it's usually psychological but it's oftentimes manifesting


1684
01:22:32.500 --> 01:22:35.200
in the physical world.


1685
01:22:36.300 --> 01:22:39.900
So what does this have to do with well has to do with beauty because


1686
01:22:39.900 --> 01:22:42.200
it's in the Libra deck in here has to do with


1687
01:22:42.200 --> 01:22:45.100
the relationship and has to do


1688
01:22:45.100 --> 01:22:48.900
with one-to-one interactions has to do with anything legal. So


1689
01:22:48.900 --> 01:22:51.600
we'll keep that in mind here because we're just looking at themes


1690
01:22:51.600 --> 01:22:54.200
right? We're breaking it down. So we're in the fifth house. We know


1691
01:22:54.200 --> 01:22:57.200
we're talking about children. That's all we need to talk about. We don't need to know about


1692
01:22:57.200 --> 01:23:00.500
romance. Obviously. We don't need to know about speculation and gambling.


1693
01:23:00.500 --> 01:23:03.900
We don't need to know about risk. Although risk can go


1694
01:23:03.900 --> 01:23:06.200
into children. So I do want to


1695
01:23:06.200 --> 01:23:09.600
keep risk in the back of my mind if there is an issue that has


1696
01:23:09.600 --> 01:23:10.700
to do with risk.


1697
01:23:11.900 --> 01:23:14.100
So Chiron is in here, there could


1698
01:23:14.100 --> 01:23:18.600
be a wound associated with risk within the partnership or


1699
01:23:17.600 --> 01:23:20.600
the the beauty of a


1700
01:23:20.600 --> 01:23:23.400
child there could also be a wound


1701
01:23:23.400 --> 01:23:27.400
within having children. There could be a wound within in Uranus.


1702
01:23:26.400 --> 01:23:29.200
I'm sorry a query I always talk


1703
01:23:29.200 --> 01:23:33.600
in the sense of the planet. But Aquarius is ruled


1704
01:23:32.600 --> 01:23:35.700
by Uranus. So it's eradicism. It's


1705
01:23:35.700 --> 01:23:39.400
friends. It's hope streams the future and


1706
01:23:38.400 --> 01:23:41.700
you're in this energy is, you know


1707
01:23:41.700 --> 01:23:44.100
things that happen out of nowhere when I'm talking


1708
01:23:44.100 --> 01:23:47.500
about when I'm thinking Chiron. I'm always thinking the negatives first


1709
01:23:47.500 --> 01:23:49.800
because I want to know what could have happened.


1710
01:23:50.900 --> 01:23:53.900
So I go to those Uranus could be something that abruptly


1711
01:23:53.900 --> 01:23:57.300
ended abruptly cut off immediately changed.


1712
01:23:58.200 --> 01:24:02.200
Or that technology of some sort was involved here.


1713
01:24:03.200 --> 01:24:06.500
I'm going to ignore these two for right now. I want to know more about Chiron. So


1714
01:24:06.500 --> 01:24:09.100
I'm gonna do two things. Remember, I told you it was like a


1715
01:24:09.100 --> 01:24:12.100
Choose Your Own Adventure. I can either look for Uranus here or


1716
01:24:12.100 --> 01:24:15.400
I can look at the aspects first right now. I feel like looking


1717
01:24:15.400 --> 01:24:18.400
at the aspects. So I'm gonna look here to the


1718
01:24:18.400 --> 01:24:21.400
Moon that's 22:28 too far out of the orb


1719
01:24:21.400 --> 01:24:25.000
of influence 28 to 29 part of


1720
01:24:24.300 --> 01:24:27.300
Fortune not going to talk about that again in


1721
01:24:27.300 --> 01:24:29.500
this class, but there is something opposing.


1722
01:24:30.400 --> 01:24:33.200
Fortune so there's an opposition now when


1723
01:24:33.200 --> 01:24:34.000
there's an opposition


1724
01:24:35.200 --> 01:24:38.400
When you're talking about children and abruptness and quick


1725
01:24:38.400 --> 01:24:41.500
either something happened and it was good or something happened


1726
01:24:41.500 --> 01:24:44.400
and it was opposing luck. It ended up being a not


1727
01:24:44.400 --> 01:24:47.400
lucky situation. Uranus is too fast


1728
01:24:47.400 --> 01:24:50.600
to allow luck to come in. So either was lucky


1729
01:24:50.600 --> 01:24:52.800
quick or lucky bad, so we know that


1730
01:24:54.100 --> 01:24:56.500
too far out of Pluto's range


1731
01:24:58.300 --> 01:25:02.200
28 and we know that it is sextile the


1732
01:25:02.200 --> 01:25:05.200
only real information that I have to go off of


1733
01:25:05.200 --> 01:25:05.400
here.


1734
01:25:08.800 --> 01:25:11.300
I always double check down here, especially when it comes


1735
01:25:11.300 --> 01:25:14.900
to this. So we have a semi-sex tile with Mercury. You


1736
01:25:14.900 --> 01:25:16.400
see it here this glyph.


1737
01:25:17.600 --> 01:25:20.400
And that is here. So I see that in the health


1738
01:25:20.400 --> 01:25:23.400
and the possible health issues because


1739
01:25:23.400 --> 01:25:26.900
I know Neptune has to do with lack of or Illusion


1740
01:25:26.900 --> 01:25:29.000
or thinking that health is a


1741
01:25:29.300 --> 01:25:32.100
certain way or communicating health and Pluto has to do


1742
01:25:32.100 --> 01:25:35.100
with transformation Evolution and potential death.


1743
01:25:36.600 --> 01:25:39.300
So I already know at this point that this


1744
01:25:39.300 --> 01:25:42.400
is probably a heavy reading and I'm preparing myself.


1745
01:25:42.400 --> 01:25:45.300
If you're an astrologer. You're looking for things in your chart


1746
01:25:45.300 --> 01:25:49.300
you're reading for somebody else. You have to realize that not every single reading


1747
01:25:48.300 --> 01:25:51.800
is going to be rainbow as


1748
01:25:51.800 --> 01:25:54.200
a butterfly. Some are serious. Some are joking


1749
01:25:54.200 --> 01:25:57.600
and fun some are like possibilities. I like


1750
01:25:57.600 --> 01:26:00.600
talking about relocation astrology and


1751
01:26:00.600 --> 01:26:03.400
I like talking about business election astrology. Why


1752
01:26:03.400 --> 01:26:06.400
because they can get heavy but not usually they're


1753
01:26:06.400 --> 01:26:09.600
not usually too heavy ironically my last two Astro


1754
01:26:09.600 --> 01:26:12.100
cartography readings were both back-to-back. Well not back


1755
01:26:12.100 --> 01:26:13.200
to back they were in the same day.


1756
01:26:14.200 --> 01:26:17.300
And both of those were kind of heavy because those people


1757
01:26:17.300 --> 01:26:20.500
were looking for an escape trying to use Astro


1758
01:26:20.500 --> 01:26:23.200
cartography to get there and they had


1759
01:26:23.200 --> 01:26:26.400
not dealt with issues and it didn't matter where I place them anywhere


1760
01:26:26.400 --> 01:26:26.700
in the world.


1761
01:26:27.700 --> 01:26:30.100
It wasn't going to fix some of the problems. It was


1762
01:26:30.100 --> 01:26:33.100
just relocating some of the issues and highlighting if they


1763
01:26:33.100 --> 01:26:36.300
went to certain places that could have been really good highlighting the issues.


1764
01:26:36.300 --> 01:26:39.500
They hadn't dealt with some from childhood some from relationships and


1765
01:26:39.500 --> 01:26:42.600
whatnot. So it's also important to understand that again. I


1766
01:26:42.600 --> 01:26:45.400
focus on the Moon Pluto and Chiron immediately and


1767
01:26:45.400 --> 01:26:48.400
almost every reading because if you haven't dealt with those and


1768
01:26:48.400 --> 01:26:49.600
learn how to use those positively


1769
01:26:50.500 --> 01:26:50.900
then


1770
01:26:53.200 --> 01:26:56.800
like I said relocation astrology doesn't really matter where you move that's


1771
01:26:56.800 --> 01:26:59.100
not going anywhere. So you have to deal with these things.


1772
01:26:59.100 --> 01:27:02.200
Once you learn how to deal with it and use it in a positive way then go to


1773
01:27:02.200 --> 01:27:05.500
a place that amplifies that positivity and become something amazing. But


1774
01:27:05.500 --> 01:27:08.500
if you're still stuck in your insecurities and you're volatility


1775
01:27:08.500 --> 01:27:11.700
and your fear there's what


1776
01:27:11.700 --> 01:27:14.300
are you going to do with that? You're just going somewhere else to amplify something


1777
01:27:14.300 --> 01:27:16.100
to amplify. Your fear can't do that.


1778
01:27:16.800 --> 01:27:19.400
So anyway back to this chart send my


1779
01:27:19.400 --> 01:27:22.100
sex tile here is an agitation. So something about the


1780
01:27:22.100 --> 01:27:23.200
child and something about


1781
01:27:24.500 --> 01:27:27.200
something that's very deep down something that's hidden something.


1782
01:27:27.200 --> 01:27:30.100
That's unknown. Potentially that has to do with


1783
01:27:31.300 --> 01:27:34.300
communication wind because it's


1784
01:27:34.300 --> 01:27:34.900
excuse me.


1785
01:27:35.800 --> 01:27:38.900
Mercury Gemini rules wind and


1786
01:27:40.100 --> 01:27:43.400
It also rules Virgo which again is doubling down on the health and


1787
01:27:43.400 --> 01:27:47.000
health issue potentially Health scare something that's missing or


1788
01:27:46.300 --> 01:27:48.200
something. That is unknown.


1789
01:27:48.700 --> 01:27:49.800
If I keep going here.


1790
01:27:51.200 --> 01:27:54.100
Chiron is forming a sex tile which is a


1791
01:27:54.100 --> 01:27:55.100
hidden opportunity.


1792
01:27:58.500 --> 01:27:58.800
which


1793
01:27:59.600 --> 01:28:01.100
I'm not gonna get too much into and then


1794
01:28:02.300 --> 01:28:05.300
I already know where this is going and then Vesta, which is


1795
01:28:05.300 --> 01:28:06.200
the spark of life.


1796
01:28:07.200 --> 01:28:10.500
Is creating a sextile here and that's in the third house and it's


1797
01:28:10.500 --> 01:28:13.000
highlighting the communication issues that have to


1798
01:28:13.200 --> 01:28:16.100
do within wind air and potentially.


1799
01:28:17.200 --> 01:28:20.200
I mean Sagittarius hell, I'm not getting into medical astrology here.


1800
01:28:20.200 --> 01:28:22.400
But Sagittarius also has to do with like the hips.


1801
01:28:23.300 --> 01:28:25.100
intestine hips


1802
01:28:26.500 --> 01:28:30.900
thyroid type regions and situations


1803
01:28:30.900 --> 01:28:33.600
Vesta is life. So if


1804
01:28:33.600 --> 01:28:34.700
I have a if I have a


1805
01:28:35.900 --> 01:28:37.500
and Jupiter expands upon it.


1806
01:28:38.700 --> 01:28:41.300
so this could be


1807
01:28:44.300 --> 01:28:47.200
this could be and I haven't gotten


1808
01:28:47.200 --> 01:28:50.600
to the rulership, but this could be the death of a child based off of something that has


1809
01:28:50.600 --> 01:28:52.300
to do with those things. Medically speaking.


1810
01:28:53.200 --> 01:28:56.100
that with their first child that


1811
01:28:58.200 --> 01:29:01.500
expanded into something specifically within


1812
01:29:01.500 --> 01:29:02.600
those areas.


1813
01:29:03.600 --> 01:29:04.600
that had to do with


1814
01:29:06.800 --> 01:29:09.300
a misdiagnosis potential misdiagnosis


1815
01:29:10.200 --> 01:29:13.600
and communication issues with communication meaning they


1816
01:29:13.600 --> 01:29:16.700
didn't get to something as quickly as they should have and


1817
01:29:18.900 --> 01:29:21.100
Yeah, because I also and then on top


1818
01:29:21.100 --> 01:29:22.400
of that the ruler.


1819
01:29:23.700 --> 01:29:26.800
And it's a heavy one. The ruler is Aquarius is


1820
01:29:26.800 --> 01:29:30.300
Uranus Uranus is over here in


1821
01:29:31.500 --> 01:29:34.300
The 11th house which does bring some luck


1822
01:29:34.300 --> 01:29:37.800
back into the situation, but it's ruler when we


1823
01:29:37.800 --> 01:29:40.100
layer and we go down the rulers the Sun


1824
01:29:40.100 --> 01:29:43.200
the sun's and the sixth house this brings the health and this all has


1825
01:29:43.200 --> 01:29:46.000
to do with the beginning of Life in terms


1826
01:29:46.100 --> 01:29:49.500
of this context this lens because the South notice


1827
01:29:49.500 --> 01:29:49.600
there.


1828
01:29:50.600 --> 01:29:53.200
So this is something that this child would have a health


1829
01:29:53.200 --> 01:29:56.900
issue from the beginning from the start and with


1830
01:29:56.900 --> 01:29:57.900
this type of energy.


1831
01:29:59.900 --> 01:30:01.400
I don't think this child made it.


1832
01:30:02.200 --> 01:30:06.500
So I think that this is something that that child that they would have had to deal


1833
01:30:05.500 --> 01:30:08.300
with because I also have the moon


1834
01:30:08.300 --> 01:30:11.400
in the seventh house which has to do with the relationships and fears and


1835
01:30:12.300 --> 01:30:16.700
The moon can create agitation fear again. It's ruler


1836
01:30:16.700 --> 01:30:18.400
is here at five degrees.


1837
01:30:19.500 --> 01:30:23.300
And that five degrees is there


1838
01:30:22.300 --> 01:30:25.300
it is. Again that five degrees


1839
01:30:25.300 --> 01:30:28.500
here in the fifth house is in conjunct


1840
01:30:28.500 --> 01:30:31.600
pluto. Usually when I see that it is not creating


1841
01:30:31.600 --> 01:30:34.100
an opportunity for regeneration. It is


1842
01:30:34.100 --> 01:30:34.600
creating.


1843
01:30:35.600 --> 01:30:36.200
a loss


1844
01:30:38.100 --> 01:30:42.000
Because those energies don't understand each other. So the whole rebirth regeneration.


1845
01:30:42.900 --> 01:30:43.500
Doesn't happen.


1846
01:30:44.700 --> 01:30:45.900
And then I see Venus here.


1847
01:30:46.800 --> 01:30:48.700
The ruler of the first house here.


1848
01:30:50.100 --> 01:30:53.000
Which contains the ascendant in Uranus? So this is


1849
01:30:53.200 --> 01:30:56.100
a quick thing abruptness. We talked about that as well.


1850
01:30:56.900 --> 01:30:59.300
and Venus is also the ruler of of


1851
01:31:00.600 --> 01:31:03.100
Taurus the vertex is in there, which has to do


1852
01:31:03.100 --> 01:31:07.100
with significant events. The eighth house also rules death first


1853
01:31:06.100 --> 01:31:09.200
house sex and house roll a


1854
01:31:09.200 --> 01:31:13.100
ship this defined the relationship by the way, because it's


1855
01:31:12.100 --> 01:31:15.800
in here Venus is here they


1856
01:31:15.800 --> 01:31:16.900
were together on this.


1857
01:31:20.600 --> 01:31:23.800
But yeah, this would be a defining point in the relationship defining


1858
01:31:23.800 --> 01:31:26.300
point in this person's life because we also have a square here


1859
01:31:26.300 --> 01:31:29.700
between within a degree between Mars


1860
01:31:29.700 --> 01:31:32.800
and the eighth house. So this is likely


1861
01:31:32.800 --> 01:31:35.300
the death of a child. If it is not the death


1862
01:31:35.300 --> 01:31:39.100
of a child then it is some sort of Developmental issue within


1863
01:31:38.100 --> 01:31:41.000
this child specifically.


1864
01:31:42.300 --> 01:31:44.500
11th house Mercury


1865
01:31:45.600 --> 01:31:47.000
specifically with the brain


1866
01:31:48.600 --> 01:31:51.700
it's either air passages brain or something that's


1867
01:31:51.700 --> 01:31:52.600
expanded out.


1868
01:31:53.400 --> 01:31:57.700
So because the third house social identity and thinking so either


1869
01:31:56.700 --> 01:31:59.400
brain disorder something with the


1870
01:31:59.400 --> 01:32:02.800
throat or I mean that's it and it either ended


1871
01:32:02.800 --> 01:32:05.800
up with something someone developmentally challenged or


1872
01:32:05.800 --> 01:32:07.400
they didn't make it.


1873
01:32:08.200 --> 01:32:11.500
That's a freaking heavy reading. I'm sorry that this ended up in a class and not


1874
01:32:11.500 --> 01:32:14.500
just a client read but these do come


1875
01:32:14.500 --> 01:32:17.400
up. So maybe this was good for some of you guys to realize that not


1876
01:32:17.400 --> 01:32:18.100
every reading.


1877
01:32:19.500 --> 01:32:22.300
Ends up being positive and you have to also remember that when


1878
01:32:22.300 --> 01:32:23.500
you're tying all this together.


1879
01:32:24.500 --> 01:32:27.100
Especially when you see an inconjunction here, that's kind of


1880
01:32:27.100 --> 01:32:31.100
the Clincher for me is that this happening of


1881
01:32:30.100 --> 01:32:33.300
the child of the first child The Happening?


1882
01:32:36.100 --> 01:32:38.000
In conjunct, it doesn't understand.


1883
01:32:39.300 --> 01:32:42.400
the Regeneration process doesn't understand now if it


1884
01:32:42.400 --> 01:32:45.300
doesn't understand death, but it's in behind the scenes so it's like


1885
01:32:46.400 --> 01:32:48.900
It's a lot of Health stuff behind the scenes here.


1886
01:32:50.200 --> 01:32:53.300
That's in the context of the first child and actually


1887
01:32:53.300 --> 01:32:57.700
all the children here. There is a wound for children


1888
01:32:57.700 --> 01:33:00.900
for this person and it it manifests


1889
01:33:00.900 --> 01:33:02.600
physically likely with the first child.


1890
01:33:03.500 --> 01:33:06.800
The second child for this person is in the seventh house. It


1891
01:33:06.800 --> 01:33:09.300
could be the reason why this person


1892
01:33:09.300 --> 01:33:10.900
with the second child here.


1893
01:33:11.800 --> 01:33:14.700
That that second child would be mothered that


1894
01:33:14.700 --> 01:33:18.100
there would be an emotional bond and emotional security within


1895
01:33:17.100 --> 01:33:20.500
the second child which relates back to


1896
01:33:20.500 --> 01:33:21.300
the first child.


1897
01:33:22.100 --> 01:33:25.500
I would imagine that either that the developmental issue or the potential


1898
01:33:25.500 --> 01:33:28.300
death or loss of the first child


1899
01:33:28.300 --> 01:33:31.400
is creating this here because again, it's


1900
01:33:31.400 --> 01:33:34.700
ruler is back in the fifth house. So because of


1901
01:33:34.700 --> 01:33:37.300
whatever happened with the fifth with the first child the second


1902
01:33:37.300 --> 01:33:37.800
child is


1903
01:33:38.700 --> 01:33:41.400
becomes like there's an


1904
01:33:41.400 --> 01:33:45.100
emotional attachment and fear associated with having so


1905
01:33:44.100 --> 01:33:47.400
between the time that they had the first child in


1906
01:33:47.400 --> 01:33:50.800
the second child. There would be a fear about having a second child and


1907
01:33:50.800 --> 01:33:53.500
thinking that it would happen the same way as the first child. It's


1908
01:33:53.500 --> 01:33:56.300
different energy though. It is seventh house. It is Aries.


1909
01:33:56.800 --> 01:33:59.400
And it is going to bring in this energy and Chiron is


1910
01:33:59.400 --> 01:34:02.200
a part of it that Chiron could just have to do with the fact that


1911
01:34:02.200 --> 01:34:03.100
the first one was lost.


1912
01:34:05.200 --> 01:34:08.600
And then it continues on the third child is here that is here


1913
01:34:08.600 --> 01:34:11.500
in the sixth house. It also


1914
01:34:11.500 --> 01:34:14.800
creates an agitation to this so it


1915
01:34:14.800 --> 01:34:17.700
could be something that they ended up they they weren't


1916
01:34:17.700 --> 01:34:20.500
able with their children. They weren't able to or


1917
01:34:20.500 --> 01:34:24.000
decided not to keep the death of that child secret and


1918
01:34:23.200 --> 01:34:26.700
they told the children. So therefore that wound is


1919
01:34:26.700 --> 01:34:29.300
agitating and the third child if there


1920
01:34:29.300 --> 01:34:32.400
are three child children third child would actually feel


1921
01:34:32.400 --> 01:34:35.400
it more than the second job. The second child would know


1922
01:34:35.400 --> 01:34:38.100
what to be a part of him. But there's something about it on the third


1923
01:34:38.100 --> 01:34:42.100
child because it's the ruler of the third child that would actually that loss


1924
01:34:41.100 --> 01:34:44.200
would be extremely agitating. So there'd be something there


1925
01:34:44.200 --> 01:34:45.100
about the


1926
01:34:46.700 --> 01:34:49.000
Um what I mean this gets deep


1927
01:34:49.200 --> 01:34:53.600
but what the child chose to do for work how this child's psyche


1928
01:34:52.600 --> 01:34:55.100
developed and all that what they


1929
01:34:55.100 --> 01:34:58.700
chose for Creative expression how they compose themselves based


1930
01:34:58.700 --> 01:35:01.900
off of the communication of finding out that that first child


1931
01:35:01.900 --> 01:35:03.700
either has an issue or isn't alive.


1932
01:35:04.700 --> 01:35:07.500
So that's heavy. That's super


1933
01:35:07.500 --> 01:35:10.300
heavy. I'm gonna move on to the next one because I didn't


1934
01:35:10.300 --> 01:35:13.600
expect that. I chose these three charts very


1935
01:35:13.600 --> 01:35:15.200
randomly and


1936
01:35:17.100 --> 01:35:20.200
Yeah, the other thing that kind


1937
01:35:20.200 --> 01:35:22.500
of solidifies it that I believe it's a loss.


1938
01:35:23.100 --> 01:35:24.800
Is that Venus here?


1939
01:35:25.900 --> 01:35:29.400
Is squaring Neptune and Neptune


1940
01:35:28.400 --> 01:35:31.100
is in the second house value?


1941
01:35:32.200 --> 01:35:35.300
And that Scorpio here could have been that they didn't have enough money


1942
01:35:35.300 --> 01:35:38.200
to save the child. It could have been that they


1943
01:35:39.200 --> 01:35:42.500
just didn't know how bad the situation was


1944
01:35:42.500 --> 01:35:45.700
and weren't able to do anything. But this also creates a


1945
01:35:45.700 --> 01:35:48.400
potential where there is value to the life, but


1946
01:35:48.400 --> 01:35:50.100
it may not be there because of this.


1947
01:35:51.700 --> 01:35:52.300
moving on


1948
01:35:53.200 --> 01:35:56.200
Sorry guys, very very sorry that that was so heavy. Let's go


1949
01:35:56.200 --> 01:35:59.100
to number three though, Rebel Academy sample three


1950
01:35:59.100 --> 01:36:02.600
again. If you're looking to be in astrologer, you


1951
01:36:02.600 --> 01:36:05.800
have to realize that these come up and I deal with these kinds of situations all


1952
01:36:05.800 --> 01:36:08.600
the time all the time very heavy


1953
01:36:08.600 --> 01:36:11.500
things and shoot within children is


1954
01:36:11.500 --> 01:36:14.300
obviously closer to my heart. It's definitely not as


1955
01:36:16.300 --> 01:36:19.200
it's very much a heavier situation when children are


1956
01:36:19.200 --> 01:36:23.000
involved for me relationships though often. They


1957
01:36:22.400 --> 01:36:26.400
obviously include and involve children and that's


1958
01:36:26.400 --> 01:36:29.700
something I didn't talk about with the first one though. Is that the well


1959
01:36:29.700 --> 01:36:32.100
I did a little bit but the children are a huge part of


1960
01:36:33.900 --> 01:36:36.200
The first child specifically is a huge part of


1961
01:36:36.200 --> 01:36:39.300
what happens with the publicity with this first one.


1962
01:36:40.800 --> 01:36:41.800
second child


1963
01:36:43.500 --> 01:36:46.200
They probably don't even well, they might have a second child second child. They


1964
01:36:46.200 --> 01:36:48.500
may not see as much if they have a second child.


1965
01:36:52.700 --> 01:36:55.400
And if they have a third child, it would be very


1966
01:36:55.400 --> 01:36:56.500
similar to the first child.


1967
01:36:57.900 --> 01:37:00.100
But that would happen later in life the third one.


1968
01:37:01.200 --> 01:37:04.700
Going over here if it happens third one third


1969
01:37:04.700 --> 01:37:07.500
person rival Academy sample, three,


1970
01:37:07.500 --> 01:37:10.200
let's hope that this one is not the same


1971
01:37:10.200 --> 01:37:13.500
and I'm telling you for real. I have


1972
01:37:13.500 --> 01:37:16.300
not looked at this prior to starting this class. I've never


1973
01:37:16.300 --> 01:37:19.300
looked at these three charts. I picked them at random put them


1974
01:37:19.300 --> 01:37:22.200
up here and I've never looked at them before I'm gonna


1975
01:37:22.200 --> 01:37:23.500
look at career.


1976
01:37:24.600 --> 01:37:27.800
Because I don't want to well I need to the children


1977
01:37:27.800 --> 01:37:30.200
and family one was Heavy. I don't know why I went to children. I could


1978
01:37:30.200 --> 01:37:31.800
have just been like what was this person's dad like


1979
01:37:33.600 --> 01:37:34.300
and that would have


1980
01:37:37.400 --> 01:37:40.200
that would have been an easier read here. The first person


1981
01:37:40.200 --> 01:37:43.700
we already did love so we did love family. And now I'm gonna do career just so


1982
01:37:43.700 --> 01:37:44.800
that you guys understanding this.


1983
01:37:47.200 --> 01:37:50.900
What if someone asks am I going to have kids sorry if


1984
01:37:50.900 --> 01:37:51.500
you want over this?


1985
01:37:52.900 --> 01:37:55.300
You can't tell if they're going to make a decision.


1986
01:37:55.300 --> 01:37:58.100
That's the thing astrology is a is not


1987
01:37:58.100 --> 01:38:02.000
a blueprint is not a blueprint it is energy and


1988
01:38:01.300 --> 01:38:04.800
you can tell if they have kids. This


1989
01:38:04.800 --> 01:38:08.200
is how the first child will be. This is your interaction and


1990
01:38:07.200 --> 01:38:10.300
then in the manifestation class, you'll say well if


1991
01:38:10.300 --> 01:38:13.400
you don't want it to be like this like if Chiron is there or whatnot you can


1992
01:38:13.400 --> 01:38:16.200
do this and you can try to focus on this so


1993
01:38:16.200 --> 01:38:19.300
that you can manifest a better life or a better


1994
01:38:19.300 --> 01:38:21.700
relationship with your child or your children.


1995
01:38:22.900 --> 01:38:25.300
So when you're looking here and whatnot.


1996
01:38:26.200 --> 01:38:29.100
This person looks like they don't even have kids based off of this energy here.


1997
01:38:29.800 --> 01:38:32.300
I don't know that but I


1998
01:38:32.300 --> 01:38:35.900
would imagine that this person doesn't have kids based off of this and this


1999
01:38:35.900 --> 01:38:36.800
and this.


2000
01:38:37.700 --> 01:38:38.600
and this


2001
01:38:39.500 --> 01:38:39.700
so


2002
01:38:43.400 --> 01:38:46.200
you can't answer if they're going to have kids I get that question a lot.


2003
01:38:46.200 --> 01:38:49.500
Am I gonna have kids? I'm sorry. I can't answer that. I don't answer it in Tarot


2004
01:38:49.500 --> 01:38:52.200
and I can't answer it in astrology. I can


2005
01:38:52.200 --> 01:38:55.100
only tell you if you have kids this is it just like I can't


2006
01:38:55.100 --> 01:38:58.700
tell you the funny thing is you know, this is like first


2007
01:38:58.700 --> 01:39:02.300
child second child if they only have two kids grandchild number


2008
01:39:02.300 --> 01:39:02.500
one.


2009
01:39:03.200 --> 01:39:05.700
If they have three kids, this is grandchild number one.


2010
01:39:06.800 --> 01:39:09.300
Right and this person it would be


2011
01:39:09.300 --> 01:39:12.700
child one child two child three child four child five child six child seven.


2012
01:39:13.700 --> 01:39:16.400
Grandchild one grandchild 2, right. It


2013
01:39:16.400 --> 01:39:19.500
just keeps going around and you don't have really any


2014
01:39:19.500 --> 01:39:21.300
way to know that and I'm speaking.


2015
01:39:22.300 --> 01:39:23.300
in terms of today


2016
01:39:24.200 --> 01:39:27.300
I haven't found a way to determine. Yes, you're


2017
01:39:27.300 --> 01:39:29.100
having kids. No, you're not the only time.


2018
01:39:30.100 --> 01:39:33.700
That I really have been able to determine if someone


2019
01:39:33.700 --> 01:39:36.100
does or doesn't have kids and I've been


2020
01:39:36.100 --> 01:39:39.200
surprised a few times so it's not foolproof. So I don't push it too much


2021
01:39:39.200 --> 01:39:43.200
but usually if I see the moon here, usually


2022
01:39:42.200 --> 01:39:45.500
there's a child at least one child the


2023
01:39:45.500 --> 01:39:48.500
moon in the fifth house because it's mothering children. It just


2024
01:39:48.500 --> 01:39:51.200
goes unless it's like Queen kunk's in conjunct something


2025
01:39:51.200 --> 01:39:51.500
or


2026
01:39:52.500 --> 01:39:55.300
causing a square to maybe Neptune or


2027
01:39:55.300 --> 01:39:58.300
something like that. Maybe they have the kid and then they lose the kid


2028
01:39:58.300 --> 01:39:59.900
through, you know custody or


2029
01:40:01.700 --> 01:40:04.200
miscarriage or anything obviously it gets heavy


2030
01:40:04.200 --> 01:40:04.300
but


2031
01:40:05.900 --> 01:40:08.600
or I've seen a bunch of times again. The


2032
01:40:08.600 --> 01:40:12.300
Moon is usually involved but Saturn in the fifth house often


2033
01:40:11.300 --> 01:40:14.200
not always but often means that in


2034
01:40:14.200 --> 01:40:14.800
their Saturn return.


2035
01:40:15.600 --> 01:40:19.500
Or any or a time that links to Saturn that


2036
01:40:18.500 --> 01:40:20.400
a child is going to come.


2037
01:40:21.200 --> 01:40:23.900
So you can't tell if they're going to have kids but you can tell.


2038
01:40:24.800 --> 01:40:27.300
When they do how that energy will be.


2039
01:40:28.100 --> 01:40:30.000
And there are some ways again to be able to tell.


2040
01:40:30.900 --> 01:40:31.900
There's probably children.


2041
01:40:37.100 --> 01:40:39.400
You guys can probably hear the sirens. They'll be gone in a minute.


2042
01:40:40.100 --> 01:40:41.500
third person


2043
01:40:43.800 --> 01:40:46.200
it's a good question, by the way, because I get asked that all the time but


2044
01:40:47.100 --> 01:40:50.100
At this point in time. I have not and maybe you guys will figure it


2045
01:40:50.100 --> 01:40:53.100
out. Maybe you guys will learn this and start doing your own theories and


2046
01:40:53.100 --> 01:40:56.800
you'll be like Logan is pretty simple this here


2047
01:40:56.800 --> 01:40:59.600
and this here says they're gonna have three kids. Why didn't


2048
01:40:59.600 --> 01:41:01.000
you figure it out and I'll be like


2049
01:41:02.300 --> 01:41:02.400
I don't know.


2050
01:41:03.800 --> 01:41:04.100
so


2051
01:41:06.200 --> 01:41:09.500
Anyway, this person here career. Now we could


2052
01:41:09.500 --> 01:41:12.800
dive into love again. There's no point. We've already talked about that. We


2053
01:41:12.800 --> 01:41:15.500
can see that this person potentially has a lot of love issues


2054
01:41:15.500 --> 01:41:18.100
here with these two energies here,


2055
01:41:18.100 --> 01:41:21.400
especially since they're opposed the ascendant, but guess what? We're not talking


2056
01:41:21.400 --> 01:41:24.300
about love. We are talking about


2057
01:41:24.300 --> 01:41:26.700
career for this person. So


2058
01:41:27.700 --> 01:41:28.400
We're going to look here.


2059
01:41:31.200 --> 01:41:33.300
And we're going to break it down. So tenth house.


2060
01:41:34.700 --> 01:41:37.700
Usually they say tenth Sixth and second. Well


2061
01:41:37.700 --> 01:41:40.100
second is money six is your


2062
01:41:40.100 --> 01:41:43.300
work and your work environment what you're doing on a daily basis and then the


2063
01:41:43.300 --> 01:41:46.200
10th house is your career. It's your Public Image. It's


2064
01:41:46.200 --> 01:41:50.000
what you know what you are known for and what you kind of do structurally the


2065
01:41:49.700 --> 01:41:52.600
midheaven is not everybody


2066
01:41:52.600 --> 01:41:55.000
aligns with it, which is surprising. If you align with


2067
01:41:55.100 --> 01:41:58.400
your mid Heaven, which is the opposite of your IC your IC being your deep


2068
01:41:58.400 --> 01:42:01.600
personal self, if you can align with your mid heaven,


2069
01:42:01.600 --> 01:42:04.400
then you are doing the job that you want to do that.


2070
01:42:04.400 --> 01:42:07.800
You should be doing that you should be known for and then


2071
01:42:07.800 --> 01:42:10.200
you combine that with the tenth house and it creates your


2072
01:42:10.200 --> 01:42:13.100
career. Now again, all of this has to do


2073
01:42:13.100 --> 01:42:16.200
with it. If you are running your own business, then the seventh house has a lot


2074
01:42:16.200 --> 01:42:19.300
to do with that. But let's just say this person doesn't own their


2075
01:42:19.300 --> 01:42:19.700
own business.


2076
01:42:20.800 --> 01:42:23.500
They have no Partners or shared resources. So we're


2077
01:42:23.500 --> 01:42:27.000
not bothering with that in the scope of the lens of


2078
01:42:26.600 --> 01:42:30.100
career. What do they do now a main


2079
01:42:29.100 --> 01:42:32.500
question. I'm going to I'm going to jump on this ahead of


2080
01:42:32.500 --> 01:42:35.700
time. I get this question all the time. I understand why


2081
01:42:35.700 --> 01:42:38.600
we get it. I've asked myself this question, but I've


2082
01:42:38.600 --> 01:42:41.300
learned over time that they're simply is no answer to


2083
01:42:41.300 --> 01:42:45.100
it. And that question is what is my life purpose one


2084
01:42:44.100 --> 01:42:46.800
of my supposed to do in this life.


2085
01:42:47.900 --> 01:42:50.400
It doesn't exist. There is no one life purpose.


2086
01:42:50.400 --> 01:42:53.400
What you're supposed to do is understand your energies so


2087
01:42:53.400 --> 01:42:56.400
that you can know what you can do what you want to do and


2088
01:42:56.400 --> 01:42:59.500
then use the transits and/or which are Divine timing


2089
01:42:59.500 --> 01:43:02.200
to see when does it align to do the things


2090
01:43:02.200 --> 01:43:05.200
that you want to do? Right? And we're again we won't be talking


2091
01:43:05.200 --> 01:43:08.100
about Divine timing in the next class. That's more the transit class.


2092
01:43:08.900 --> 01:43:11.800
We're going to talk about manifestation next class here. I'm


2093
01:43:11.800 --> 01:43:13.400
going to tie it together break it down.


2094
01:43:14.400 --> 01:43:17.800
And talk about just what types of energies because


2095
01:43:17.800 --> 01:43:20.200
this is really what a career reading comes down to what are


2096
01:43:20.200 --> 01:43:24.300
the energies that surround what this person can do should do and then


2097
01:43:24.300 --> 01:43:27.400
it's really up to them to decide what they want oftentimes in


2098
01:43:27.400 --> 01:43:31.000
my readings. People will tell me. I've been thinking about doing this sometimes I'll


2099
01:43:30.200 --> 01:43:33.100
say That's Not Really


2100
01:43:33.100 --> 01:43:36.900
Gonna pan out sometimes I'll say hell. Yeah that aligns


2101
01:43:36.900 --> 01:43:39.600
directly with what you're supposed to do. What are you waiting on and


2102
01:43:39.600 --> 01:43:42.900
then we look at the transit to see what they're waiting on and then


2103
01:43:42.900 --> 01:43:45.300
other times I'm like, well you can do that.


2104
01:43:45.300 --> 01:43:48.200
But if you do that you really need to do it this way


2105
01:43:48.200 --> 01:43:51.300
blah blah blah and I give them the advice and they're like, oh my


2106
01:43:51.300 --> 01:43:54.300
goodness. I thought about that, but I wasn't sure it's amazing how


2107
01:43:56.600 --> 01:44:01.000
Synchronistic, I guess or serendipitous


2108
01:44:00.200 --> 01:44:03.200
maybe that it can be in these readings where


2109
01:44:03.200 --> 01:44:06.300
you're like, well this is and this and they're like, oh I was thinking of that and


2110
01:44:06.300 --> 01:44:09.600
then they end up doing it and then they can make money if they follow all of


2111
01:44:09.600 --> 01:44:10.500
that this person.


2112
01:44:11.500 --> 01:44:14.000
Already has the part of Fortune again. I'm not going to


2113
01:44:14.200 --> 01:44:17.400
talk too much about this necess is interesting. I won't talk about that either but


2114
01:44:17.400 --> 01:44:19.100
there's a conjunction between kind of


2115
01:44:20.300 --> 01:44:22.100
technically there is not well.


2116
01:44:24.300 --> 01:44:27.300
I don't know if nessus has enough. This could be a


2117
01:44:27.300 --> 01:44:30.100
conjunction part of Fortune's a mathematical point. So it is


2118
01:44:30.100 --> 01:44:33.700
not conjuncting anything necess is an asteroid it could


2119
01:44:34.800 --> 01:44:37.400
I don't know how far this I haven't studied necess enough


2120
01:44:37.400 --> 01:44:40.700
to know how far of an orb of influence I would get give it. I'm


2121
01:44:40.700 --> 01:44:43.100
not reading it anyway, but this could be something.


2122
01:44:45.500 --> 01:44:48.400
Worth knowing once I learned necess more right? I don't


2123
01:44:48.400 --> 01:44:51.100
know everything. I don't have all the answers. I just have a lot


2124
01:44:51.100 --> 01:44:54.500
of them and you guys are going to expand upon everything. I'm


2125
01:44:54.500 --> 01:44:56.800
teaching here, which I think is going to be amazing.


2126
01:44:57.900 --> 01:44:59.100
But anyway this person here.


2127
01:45:00.400 --> 01:45:03.300
And I'm not gonna talk about series either but I shouldn't even


2128
01:45:03.300 --> 01:45:07.700
be showing them but I kind of naturally click these things anyway Gemini


2129
01:45:06.700 --> 01:45:09.800
so this person can make money through speaking


2130
01:45:09.800 --> 01:45:13.600
this Monday can make money through communication through


2131
01:45:12.600 --> 01:45:15.800
anything that's local and they


2132
01:45:15.800 --> 01:45:18.200
have their part of Fortune here. So


2133
01:45:18.200 --> 01:45:21.600
this for anything that's written word. This person here has a


2134
01:45:21.600 --> 01:45:24.700
part of Fortune so they can make a lot of money doing these


2135
01:45:24.700 --> 01:45:27.400
things and abundance of money more than most because


2136
01:45:27.400 --> 01:45:30.400
it's just kind of there money makes money for them if they're


2137
01:45:30.400 --> 01:45:30.900
smart with it.


2138
01:45:31.900 --> 01:45:34.000
its ruler when I do


2139
01:45:34.100 --> 01:45:37.700
this reading is in Leo, which has to do with entertainment this


2140
01:45:37.700 --> 01:45:38.900
has to do with home so


2141
01:45:39.800 --> 01:45:41.800
they could do entertainment from home they could do.


2142
01:45:42.700 --> 01:45:46.600
Again, it could be written entertainment. It could be the moon's


2143
01:45:45.600 --> 01:45:48.600
public there could be an aspect of the public


2144
01:45:48.600 --> 01:45:51.100
in here. But there they would be very private about


2145
01:45:51.100 --> 01:45:55.300
it. So if this person did have a public component of


2146
01:45:57.400 --> 01:45:58.400
of entertainment


2147
01:45:59.400 --> 01:46:02.200
entertaining of some sort that would either


2148
01:46:02.200 --> 01:46:02.800
be a home.


2149
01:46:03.700 --> 01:46:06.300
A sense of home and sense of


2150
01:46:06.300 --> 01:46:09.300
family to it or they would be very private about it you would


2151
01:46:09.300 --> 01:46:11.000
know of them, but you wouldn't know much about them.


2152
01:46:12.500 --> 01:46:15.500
especially here with their identity being in Leo, so they're


2153
01:46:15.500 --> 01:46:16.000
kind of


2154
01:46:17.300 --> 01:46:20.400
You know, they can talk they can talk about themselves and talk about the things they like


2155
01:46:20.400 --> 01:46:23.400
about music about kids about Adventure whatnot.


2156
01:46:23.400 --> 01:46:26.100
But it's all like their private like they keep


2157
01:46:26.100 --> 01:46:26.900
a lot of it to themselves.


2158
01:46:28.300 --> 01:46:29.500
the sun here in Vesta


2159
01:46:30.200 --> 01:46:33.800
So that's kind of here. We know that with a


2160
01:46:33.800 --> 01:46:36.300
direct conjunction here that they're likely is some sort


2161
01:46:36.300 --> 01:46:37.300
of either.


2162
01:46:38.900 --> 01:46:41.600
Alright, so here's what we're gonna have to do. Right? So this is where this one's


2163
01:46:41.600 --> 01:46:43.900
a good one because this makes me dive deeper.


2164
01:46:44.800 --> 01:46:47.300
This is just how they make money, right? We're looking at


2165
01:46:47.300 --> 01:46:50.400
the lens of career only money right now. So only


2166
01:46:50.400 --> 01:46:50.900
the second house.


2167
01:46:51.800 --> 01:46:52.500
so Gemini


2168
01:46:53.700 --> 01:46:56.000
Mercury is the ruler Mercury is here


2169
01:46:56.100 --> 01:47:00.800
in the fourth house. I explain what all that means conjunction with.


2170
01:47:00.800 --> 01:47:03.600
The third house ruler, right Cancer's rulers


2171
01:47:03.600 --> 01:47:06.200
is the Moon. The Moon is over here. It is


2172
01:47:06.200 --> 01:47:09.600
conjunctus. So this brings an element of making money


2173
01:47:09.600 --> 01:47:12.600
through something public that is in entertainment


2174
01:47:12.600 --> 01:47:15.400
or children or nurturing or


2175
01:47:15.400 --> 01:47:18.600
home that has to do with either Recreation money


2176
01:47:18.600 --> 01:47:22.200
gambling children or entertainment the


2177
01:47:21.200 --> 01:47:24.600
sun. Is there the sun doubles


2178
01:47:24.600 --> 01:47:27.600
down on all of those themes and makes this the most prominent


2179
01:47:27.600 --> 01:47:30.400
thing here, but there's still a private aspect of it


2180
01:47:30.400 --> 01:47:31.400
because it's in the fourth house.


2181
01:47:33.100 --> 01:47:36.700
It doesn't do anything with the midheaven. Although Venus does.


2182
01:47:37.400 --> 01:47:40.100
Okay, so and I'm about to get to Venus.


2183
01:47:41.100 --> 01:47:44.800
So all of this here this home this private this entertainment


2184
01:47:44.800 --> 01:47:47.800
this children anything that is here. It's ruler


2185
01:47:47.800 --> 01:47:48.400
is


2186
01:47:49.500 --> 01:47:52.600
it the third house rulers has to do with identity and communication


2187
01:47:52.600 --> 01:47:56.400
again. This has to do with culture and expanding it


2188
01:47:56.400 --> 01:47:59.600
is conjunct Mars. So this involves their physical body


2189
01:47:59.600 --> 01:48:02.700
this involves something that they physically do and wherever


2190
01:48:02.700 --> 01:48:05.400
Aries is Aries is 12th house,


2191
01:48:05.400 --> 01:48:05.600
so


2192
01:48:06.800 --> 01:48:09.200
now we have to this is where it gets very


2193
01:48:11.300 --> 01:48:14.000
sorry Ashley asks, what was ruling gambling Leo?


2194
01:48:14.700 --> 01:48:16.700
Leo rules risk and gambling


2195
01:48:19.500 --> 01:48:21.800
which is also the fifth house, which is also the Sun.


2196
01:48:22.700 --> 01:48:25.300
It's where we feel alive. It's that


2197
01:48:25.300 --> 01:48:26.300
kind of it's where that comes from.


2198
01:48:27.500 --> 01:48:30.300
Now this is what we need to do is when you're breaking it down.


2199
01:48:31.600 --> 01:48:33.800
if you try to break down everything for every


2200
01:48:35.100 --> 01:48:38.900
Definition of it. If you try to break down the sun in every definition Mercury


2201
01:48:38.900 --> 01:48:41.600
every definition. You are welcome. If you


2202
01:48:41.600 --> 01:48:44.200
try to break down the moon in every definition you do that at the


2203
01:48:44.200 --> 01:48:47.100
beginning because you haven't gotten enough information, but once you've gotten as much as


2204
01:48:47.100 --> 01:48:50.300
we've already gotten now that we know that the third house the


2205
01:48:50.300 --> 01:48:52.500
identity the communication all that


2206
01:48:53.400 --> 01:48:56.300
That Jupiter and Mars here, and I'm I'm starting


2207
01:48:56.300 --> 01:48:59.400
with Mars and I'm gonna look at the others as well that that


2208
01:48:59.400 --> 01:49:02.600
is the rule of the twelfth house that I don't need to dive


2209
01:49:02.600 --> 01:49:05.600
as much in the 12th house has to do with I


2210
01:49:05.600 --> 01:49:08.200
can narrow it down a bit now, right 12th house


2211
01:49:08.200 --> 01:49:11.800
has to do with film and media music


2212
01:49:11.800 --> 01:49:14.000
spirituality. It's all the


2213
01:49:14.600 --> 01:49:17.200
Neptune stuff medical and anything behind the


2214
01:49:17.200 --> 01:49:17.600
scenes.


2215
01:49:18.800 --> 01:49:21.800
Okay. So those are the main things so an


2216
01:49:21.800 --> 01:49:24.700
Aries is something pioneering something that they


2217
01:49:24.700 --> 01:49:27.700
do so I know that if it


2218
01:49:27.700 --> 01:49:27.700
is.


2219
01:49:29.600 --> 01:49:32.200
If it is music that it is


2220
01:49:32.200 --> 01:49:34.100
like new music that they would do.


2221
01:49:35.200 --> 01:49:38.300
I would look at Neptune Neptune's and Scorpio if it


2222
01:49:38.300 --> 01:49:41.200
was music, it would be more like Emo music that they


2223
01:49:41.200 --> 01:49:43.600
would sing one to one could be singing to public.


2224
01:49:44.300 --> 01:49:48.300
If it is medical then it would be potentially surgeries


2225
01:49:47.300 --> 01:49:50.300
that other people wouldn't do


2226
01:49:50.300 --> 01:49:53.900
potentially surgery something that they would work with the crime


2227
01:49:53.900 --> 01:49:56.000
lab or something like that because it's Aries with


2228
01:49:56.800 --> 01:49:59.200
Scorpio. If it is entertainment, then it is


2229
01:49:59.200 --> 01:50:02.500
film. It's like action film that's like


2230
01:50:02.500 --> 01:50:04.900
family. So like family action film somehow.


2231
01:50:06.100 --> 01:50:09.400
In pulling all together so we know that we know Jupiter is


2232
01:50:09.400 --> 01:50:12.600
here and that's the ruler of the eighth house. So there's something


2233
01:50:12.600 --> 01:50:16.100
against secretive Illuminating sex


2234
01:50:15.100 --> 01:50:18.100
taboo. That kind of stuff would be in here.


2235
01:50:18.100 --> 01:50:21.500
Now if I know that it's deep bonds text taboo. I'm probably going


2236
01:50:21.500 --> 01:50:22.400
to rule out children.


2237
01:50:23.400 --> 01:50:26.300
And this is how you start breaking it down. Like it could


2238
01:50:26.300 --> 01:50:28.800
be intimate bonds with storytelling with children.


2239
01:50:30.100 --> 01:50:33.600
But it's probably not because those energies in


2240
01:50:33.600 --> 01:50:36.200
my head anyway kind of conflict with each other.


2241
01:50:37.200 --> 01:50:40.100
So it could be music it could be film. It could be


2242
01:50:40.100 --> 01:50:43.400
surgery. It could be medical now. We're


2243
01:50:43.400 --> 01:50:44.700
still breaking it down here.


2244
01:50:46.400 --> 01:50:47.600
Venus here


2245
01:50:49.100 --> 01:50:52.300
So we had Sagittarius and we have Mars so we know also that the


2246
01:50:52.300 --> 01:50:55.500
ruler of the eighth house and the ruler of the twelfth house are working


2247
01:50:55.500 --> 01:50:55.800
together.


2248
01:50:56.800 --> 01:50:59.400
Because they're conjuncts. So with the 8th 2012 house


2249
01:50:59.400 --> 01:51:00.700
all work together here.


2250
01:51:01.500 --> 01:51:04.600
In the third house. So again it has to do with writing it


2251
01:51:04.600 --> 01:51:07.100
has to do with communication. It has to


2252
01:51:07.100 --> 01:51:10.500
do with identity. And this is all based off of either the public


2253
01:51:10.500 --> 01:51:14.300
because cancer rules the public and so


2254
01:51:14.300 --> 01:51:17.300
does the moon so does the fourth house kind


2255
01:51:17.300 --> 01:51:17.300
of


2256
01:51:18.400 --> 01:51:21.200
I know that's weird, but it's really seventh and


2257
01:51:21.200 --> 01:51:24.000
10th house that rule it. I don't know why it's switched around but this is


2258
01:51:24.200 --> 01:51:24.500
the way it works.


2259
01:51:27.800 --> 01:51:30.700
Where was it going with this? There's an element of partnership in


2260
01:51:30.700 --> 01:51:33.800
the identity. So if it's


2261
01:51:33.800 --> 01:51:36.800
music, they're singing about love if it's film it's


2262
01:51:36.800 --> 01:51:37.200
you know.


2263
01:51:38.500 --> 01:51:38.900
You know.


2264
01:51:39.700 --> 01:51:42.300
Romance and and like partnership stuff


2265
01:51:42.300 --> 01:51:45.500
if it's if it's action stuff, it's like buddy cop stuff


2266
01:51:45.500 --> 01:51:46.500
or their partner.


2267
01:51:47.500 --> 01:51:50.700
Usually they are not by themselves


2268
01:51:50.700 --> 01:51:52.900
in whatever they're doing. There's an aspect of partnership.


2269
01:51:53.900 --> 01:51:54.800
Venus here


2270
01:51:55.600 --> 01:52:00.100
Is interesting so Venus brings Venus is


2271
01:51:59.100 --> 01:52:02.200
the ruler of Libra Venus is the ruler of


2272
01:52:02.200 --> 01:52:05.500
Taurus. So where are Venus? We're Taurus and where our Libra


2273
01:52:05.500 --> 01:52:05.700
well


2274
01:52:06.500 --> 01:52:07.200
Taurus here


2275
01:52:09.900 --> 01:52:12.400
is is in the first house is the


2276
01:52:12.400 --> 01:52:13.500
ascendant it's in.


2277
01:52:14.500 --> 01:52:17.400
At 20 degrees with the North Node 20 degrees. This is


2278
01:52:17.400 --> 01:52:17.800
someone who


2279
01:52:19.400 --> 01:52:22.300
in order for their career, they find their career. They


2280
01:52:22.300 --> 01:52:25.100
find their footing in career later in life. As soon as they start


2281
01:52:25.100 --> 01:52:28.100
identifying with themselves and figuring out who they are.


2282
01:52:29.700 --> 01:52:32.500
That's not to say that they can't have a career or that


2283
01:52:32.500 --> 01:52:36.100
it's not going to be in that but you'll notice over time that they're


2284
01:52:35.100 --> 01:52:39.100
stepping into their sensuality their


2285
01:52:38.100 --> 01:52:41.800
Womanhood their value. They'll get money money over


2286
01:52:41.800 --> 01:52:45.300
time in their career. They get paid more subsequently as


2287
01:52:45.300 --> 01:52:48.300
they carry on and they step into that after 30 years


2288
01:52:48.300 --> 01:52:48.900
old or so.


2289
01:52:49.800 --> 01:52:52.200
It's in Saturn. So that has to do with career. It


2290
01:52:52.200 --> 01:52:55.500
has to do with structure and has to do with like being


2291
01:52:55.500 --> 01:52:56.600
very regimented.


2292
01:53:00.300 --> 01:53:01.700
Is a lot of energy by the way.


2293
01:53:02.700 --> 01:53:05.600
We do see also a Trine here with these energies


2294
01:53:05.600 --> 01:53:08.800
with the fifth house fifth house is also entertainment, but Virgo


2295
01:53:08.800 --> 01:53:11.700
is like service. It's like daily. So it's like it


2296
01:53:11.700 --> 01:53:14.600
could be something that has a recurring feel could be


2297
01:53:14.600 --> 01:53:17.400
something that they're very Pluto and


2298
01:53:17.400 --> 01:53:20.400
Uranus is like they show up they do their thing and they leave


2299
01:53:20.400 --> 01:53:23.500
but they're also there to help out with other people and they're


2300
01:53:23.500 --> 01:53:24.600
like friendly.


2301
01:53:25.800 --> 01:53:26.500
if it's Medical


2302
01:53:27.700 --> 01:53:30.500
you're bringing children back in right? So if


2303
01:53:30.500 --> 01:53:32.800
it is medical this is where we bring children in.


2304
01:53:34.700 --> 01:53:37.100
I have a lot of Leo energy here. So I


2305
01:53:37.100 --> 01:53:40.400
either have entertainment of some sort or I


2306
01:53:40.400 --> 01:53:43.300
have children. That's really the only two things that I'm thinking


2307
01:53:43.300 --> 01:53:46.300
here entertainment and children because of all of


2308
01:53:46.300 --> 01:53:48.200
this energy here, but I'm gonna keep going


2309
01:53:49.500 --> 01:53:52.200
Venus opposes the mid heaven


2310
01:53:52.800 --> 01:53:55.700
Well, if Venus supposes the midheaven, that's everything that


2311
01:53:55.700 --> 01:53:58.600
we're talking about here is based off of their childhood


2312
01:53:58.600 --> 01:54:01.100
is based off of who they are and they put all of


2313
01:54:01.100 --> 01:54:04.500
that into their job. They also have find a work home balance


2314
01:54:04.500 --> 01:54:07.500
here as well and sometimes their home


2315
01:54:07.500 --> 01:54:10.600
life because they were talking about cancer and the IC things that


2316
01:54:10.600 --> 01:54:13.900
are personal deep down in their home life that we


2317
01:54:13.900 --> 01:54:16.100
wouldn't know about because excuse me Eighth House


2318
01:54:16.100 --> 01:54:17.900
and 12th house energy with the IC.


2319
01:54:18.800 --> 01:54:20.100
We don't know much about this person.


2320
01:54:21.700 --> 01:54:24.100
Like publicly speaking, even though public the public


2321
01:54:24.100 --> 01:54:27.000
does not know much about this person and the public is very


2322
01:54:27.800 --> 01:54:30.400
infatuated with this person as well because you're talking about bringing the eighth and


2323
01:54:30.400 --> 01:54:33.700
the 12th. There's something very mystical and alluring about this


2324
01:54:33.700 --> 01:54:35.000
and we just keep going


2325
01:54:35.800 --> 01:54:38.400
midheaven in so that's money. That's all


2326
01:54:38.400 --> 01:54:41.900
how they make their money. They make their money by doing all this. Well, what's


2327
01:54:41.900 --> 01:54:44.100
their daily life? I'm gonna skip them in heaven


2328
01:54:44.100 --> 01:54:47.800
and I'm gonna come back to it. What's their daily work life? Like well,


2329
01:54:47.800 --> 01:54:50.600
they work with something either Partnerships or something


2330
01:54:50.600 --> 01:54:53.500
public facing something that has some sort of legal


2331
01:54:53.500 --> 01:54:56.200
component to it. But this is an empty house.


2332
01:54:56.200 --> 01:55:00.100
So it's not it's likely not service oriented


2333
01:54:59.100 --> 01:55:00.700
in terms of


2334
01:55:02.100 --> 01:55:05.800
I didn't talk about this before but Venus I'm about to the rulers


2335
01:55:05.800 --> 01:55:08.500
Venus again, which is also the ruler of their ascendant.


2336
01:55:08.500 --> 01:55:11.600
So their work and themselves are


2337
01:55:11.600 --> 01:55:14.600
ruled by the same Planet. So they are very work


2338
01:55:14.600 --> 01:55:17.200
oriented. Even if they come up they show


2339
01:55:17.200 --> 01:55:20.100
up and they get invested in and like abruptly leave or they


2340
01:55:20.100 --> 01:55:23.500
develop friendships with it within it whatever they're very


2341
01:55:23.500 --> 01:55:26.100
work oriented, but they try to find they try to


2342
01:55:26.100 --> 01:55:29.100
strike balance within it and try to do things that are fair.


2343
01:55:31.200 --> 01:55:34.000
Its ruler is Venus Venus is in the third


2344
01:55:34.300 --> 01:55:37.200
house. So this has to do with sale a third house is


2345
01:55:37.200 --> 01:55:37.900
also sales, but it's


2346
01:55:39.100 --> 01:55:42.200
it's home. So if there's if they're selling they're selling


2347
01:55:42.200 --> 01:55:43.700
the families, they're selling the women as well.


2348
01:55:44.700 --> 01:55:47.200
Venus what I didn't mention before is very important is


2349
01:55:47.200 --> 01:55:50.100
that 29 degrees with an orb of influence of four to


2350
01:55:50.100 --> 01:55:54.000
five degrees? It means it's spilling over and it's all part of this. So Mercury the


2351
01:55:53.200 --> 01:55:56.900
moon and Venus are actually all conjunct.


2352
01:55:56.900 --> 01:55:59.500
This is a stellium but is a stellium that crosses


2353
01:55:59.500 --> 01:56:04.000
the third and fourth cuspline and and across


2354
01:56:03.100 --> 01:56:06.600
signs as well. So like I


2355
01:56:06.600 --> 01:56:09.200
said, a lot of other people don't count stallions when they


2356
01:56:09.200 --> 01:56:12.300
cross blinds, but I do because these energies work together regardless of


2357
01:56:12.300 --> 01:56:15.400
what sign they're in they share energy and they bring energy between


2358
01:56:15.400 --> 01:56:18.400
each other. So you're talking about the public and entertainment you're talking


2359
01:56:18.400 --> 01:56:21.400
about nurturing and children, but that's


2360
01:56:21.400 --> 01:56:24.500
all kind of here in the same thing and we haven't figured


2361
01:56:24.500 --> 01:56:27.300
out yet what it is because we haven't gotten


2362
01:56:27.300 --> 01:56:30.100
enough detail. We haven't no deep enough, but those are the main things


2363
01:56:30.100 --> 01:56:31.300
so if they wanted to do something


2364
01:56:32.500 --> 01:56:35.500
Culturally speaking expanding out


2365
01:56:35.500 --> 01:56:38.500
that had to do with nurturing and motherhood and children and whatnot.


2366
01:56:38.500 --> 01:56:42.600
It's likely because of this sextile


2367
01:56:41.600 --> 01:56:46.600
here and this right? Yes.


2368
01:56:48.600 --> 01:56:49.800
only the Neptune


2369
01:56:51.200 --> 01:56:52.200
word enough to go


2370
01:56:55.500 --> 01:56:58.200
Oh, no, we don't have one. Oh, so this is how the


2371
01:56:58.200 --> 01:57:01.500
orb of influence so that makes sense. So this doesn't have any influence


2372
01:57:01.500 --> 01:57:04.100
here. So it's just the sextile here. They likely don't have


2373
01:57:04.100 --> 01:57:06.300
their own kids. I'd be very surprised if they did.


2374
01:57:07.600 --> 01:57:09.500
But other people's kids.


2375
01:57:10.200 --> 01:57:13.200
They would like have a strong bond with so again, we're still in children,


2376
01:57:13.200 --> 01:57:14.500
and we're still in entertainment.


2377
01:57:15.700 --> 01:57:18.400
their daily life ties back into how


2378
01:57:18.400 --> 01:57:21.700
they make their money their work ties directly back into their


2379
01:57:22.700 --> 01:57:25.300
Again, this is opposing midheaven. It's at


2380
01:57:25.300 --> 01:57:28.300
29 degrees and there's a sextile with the


2381
01:57:28.300 --> 01:57:31.600
ruler of the tenth house which we haven't gotten to but that means they're Public


2382
01:57:31.600 --> 01:57:34.500
Image the way they handle themselves within the public their private


2383
01:57:34.500 --> 01:57:35.600
life and the


2384
01:57:36.600 --> 01:57:39.800
and all of that that all


2385
01:57:39.800 --> 01:57:42.200
ties together and the way that they make


2386
01:57:42.200 --> 01:57:45.800
money and the way then what they do on a daily basis is the


2387
01:57:45.800 --> 01:57:48.500
same right? So it's not like they have a job and the


2388
01:57:48.500 --> 01:57:51.400
way they make money as a specific component of the job. It's just


2389
01:57:51.400 --> 01:57:54.200
flows together. It's all part of it. I hope you guys are caught up so


2390
01:57:54.200 --> 01:57:57.500
far we're gonna keep going this that we're about to


2391
01:57:57.500 --> 01:58:00.100
talk about not this next thing but the thing after so I'm kind of


2392
01:58:00.100 --> 01:58:03.400
saying this in advance too far in advance, but the thing I'm gonna say after


2393
01:58:03.400 --> 01:58:06.700
this is what separates me and now you from everybody


2394
01:58:06.700 --> 01:58:07.000
else.


2395
01:58:10.200 --> 01:58:13.500
Damn it. I said that too soon, but it's the fact that I don't just


2396
01:58:13.500 --> 01:58:13.900
use.


2397
01:58:15.300 --> 01:58:18.200
the 10th house for career that I don't just use the mid heaven


2398
01:58:18.200 --> 01:58:22.600
then I don't just use a second and six that Saturn differentiates everything


2399
01:58:22.600 --> 01:58:26.000
that Capricorn differentiates everything


2400
01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:26.400
so


2401
01:58:27.300 --> 01:58:30.300
How does that work? Well, let's do the 10th house. Then we'll do Saturn and


2402
01:58:30.300 --> 01:58:33.700
Capricorn right because capric Saturn anytime you look at Saturn. It's


2403
01:58:33.700 --> 01:58:36.500
coming from Capricorn. So you have to figure out you


2404
01:58:36.500 --> 01:58:38.800
know how that applies to career.


2405
01:58:39.900 --> 01:58:42.900
Put that on pause for a second. Let's go here 10th


2406
01:58:42.900 --> 01:58:42.900
house.


2407
01:58:43.900 --> 01:58:46.100
Is in Aquarius now, we already talked a little


2408
01:58:46.100 --> 01:58:49.200
bit about the mid Heaven. We're going to come back to it the 10th house


2409
01:58:49.200 --> 01:58:52.300
in Aquarius. The Public Image is on and off again has


2410
01:58:52.300 --> 01:58:56.400
to do with friendships has to do with either technology or networking


2411
01:58:55.400 --> 01:58:58.200
or standing out and being


2412
01:58:58.200 --> 01:58:59.900
unique. That's their Public Image.


2413
01:59:00.700 --> 01:59:03.400
And it's ruler Uranus is in the


2414
01:59:03.400 --> 01:59:06.600
fifth house. So they're uniqueness their Public


2415
01:59:06.600 --> 01:59:09.500
Image of Technology. The public image that


2416
01:59:09.500 --> 01:59:12.500
has to do with how they do things differently or they're on


2417
01:59:12.500 --> 01:59:16.700
and off again image is related to the secretive


2418
01:59:15.700 --> 01:59:18.200
nature or anything that has


2419
01:59:18.200 --> 01:59:21.700
to do with their relationships or lack thereof


2420
01:59:21.700 --> 01:59:22.500
with Neptune here.


2421
01:59:23.600 --> 01:59:26.100
In the house in the fifth house, which has to


2422
01:59:26.100 --> 01:59:30.200
do with again entertainment and children. So


2423
01:59:29.200 --> 01:59:32.200
I have both of these still again and that


2424
01:59:32.200 --> 01:59:35.700
is service something daily and they're well,


2425
01:59:35.700 --> 01:59:38.000
we're not gonna read in the lens of Health. We're still reading in the


2426
01:59:38.500 --> 01:59:42.100
lens of career every planet every placement career career


2427
01:59:41.100 --> 01:59:42.500
career.


2428
01:59:43.200 --> 01:59:46.600
So now I know that their Public Image has to do with either entertainment or


2429
01:59:46.600 --> 01:59:48.200
children, so they are known for this.


2430
01:59:49.100 --> 01:59:51.200
their job is is this


2431
01:59:52.600 --> 01:59:55.100
The midheaven opposes Venus now, the other thing


2432
01:59:55.100 --> 01:59:58.400
that Venus rules is the Arts. It is also their chart ruler.


2433
01:59:58.400 --> 02:00:01.700
So they are known in their career something structured


2434
02:00:01.700 --> 02:00:04.400
something that has Public Image and notoriety.


2435
02:00:05.300 --> 02:00:07.500
potentially internationally or culturally


2436
02:00:08.600 --> 02:00:11.400
is the ninth house now that's that


2437
02:00:11.400 --> 02:00:14.400
ruler is Saturn. So I need to know where Saturn


2438
02:00:14.400 --> 02:00:17.100
is but specifically speaking. I would go to Saturn. Anyway,


2439
02:00:17.100 --> 02:00:20.700
Saturn is Chiron. So this person has had issues


2440
02:00:20.700 --> 02:00:23.500
within their career specifically ups and


2441
02:00:23.500 --> 02:00:27.400
downs because we know I said on and off again here and


2442
02:00:26.400 --> 02:00:30.000
being able to maintain a longevity


2443
02:00:29.300 --> 02:00:32.300
of a career that doesn't mean that they're


2444
02:00:32.300 --> 02:00:35.300
not good at their career or anything like that. They just


2445
02:00:36.200 --> 02:00:39.500
Are having they have difficulties when it comes to being able


2446
02:00:39.500 --> 02:00:42.300
to have the goals and dreams and the hopes that they would want


2447
02:00:42.300 --> 02:00:45.200
for themselves for their career. We're talking about the 11th house. This is


2448
02:00:45.200 --> 02:00:48.000
hopes and dreams and Chiron is saying that they are going to


2449
02:00:48.100 --> 02:00:51.500
have insecurities with it being able to attain them that maybe some


2450
02:00:51.500 --> 02:00:54.000
of their hopes dreams pertaining to Career anyway.


2451
02:00:55.300 --> 02:00:58.900
Are a little too out there, but Saturn in Pisces is


2452
02:00:58.900 --> 02:01:03.400
film spirituality Medical.


2453
02:01:04.300 --> 02:01:04.500
so


2454
02:01:05.600 --> 02:01:08.600
it's all this energy as well. So here's the thing. How


2455
02:01:08.600 --> 02:01:11.600
do you put out there? Someone who has all this and


2456
02:01:11.600 --> 02:01:14.400
whatever so they could have chosen any of these routes and


2457
02:01:14.400 --> 02:01:17.600
then Saturn's Saturn is


2458
02:01:17.600 --> 02:01:20.100
trying this is kind of where you start


2459
02:01:20.100 --> 02:01:25.100
narrowing it down Saturn is trying Public Image communication


2460
02:01:23.100 --> 02:01:27.100
and Venus


2461
02:01:26.100 --> 02:01:30.100
which has to do with the Arts, which is also the public ruler.


2462
02:01:29.100 --> 02:01:32.300
This person is known this person


2463
02:01:32.300 --> 02:01:35.600
is well known so medically speaking how many


2464
02:01:35.600 --> 02:01:38.000
doctors surgeons whatever. Do you


2465
02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:38.300
know?


2466
02:01:39.100 --> 02:01:41.600
Probably not many by name this person's name.


2467
02:01:42.300 --> 02:01:46.000
Midheaven in Capricorn in the ninth house is Global


2468
02:01:45.000 --> 02:01:46.700
International.


2469
02:01:47.600 --> 02:01:48.400
this person


2470
02:01:49.100 --> 02:01:52.200
in Pluto is like I said on and off against


2471
02:01:52.200 --> 02:01:54.900
Cycles changes. They have a lot of


2472
02:01:57.500 --> 02:02:00.300
Issues within their career that they can come back they can


2473
02:02:00.300 --> 02:02:03.600
come back a new person when you do see them because of


2474
02:02:03.600 --> 02:02:06.900
the trying to this their image changes each


2475
02:02:06.900 --> 02:02:09.200
time and they're struggling to figure out who they


2476
02:02:09.200 --> 02:02:12.300
are especially within their career. This is actually really


2477
02:02:12.300 --> 02:02:12.900
deep for this.


2478
02:02:13.700 --> 02:02:15.300
as you dive in


2479
02:02:16.100 --> 02:02:16.900
this is film.


2480
02:02:17.800 --> 02:02:20.300
I can tell it's film or entertainment at some


2481
02:02:20.300 --> 02:02:23.400
point, but it's film it's not music. It is filmed because


2482
02:02:23.400 --> 02:02:26.600
it's art related right music doesn't usually


2483
02:02:26.600 --> 02:02:29.200
bring in unless it's certain ways. It


2484
02:02:29.200 --> 02:02:32.100
doesn't usually bring in Venus this way, especially with


2485
02:02:32.100 --> 02:02:35.500
Mars there in the same house. This is saying that this is somebody who


2486
02:02:35.500 --> 02:02:38.500
does a lot who does a lot of this type of stuff has


2487
02:02:38.500 --> 02:02:41.600
huge public exposure here, but usually


2488
02:02:41.600 --> 02:02:44.700
when it's connected to somebody else right there's


2489
02:02:44.700 --> 02:02:47.600
partnership that's an aspect here money is not really an


2490
02:02:47.600 --> 02:02:50.700
issue for this person, but they do have a difficult


2491
02:02:50.700 --> 02:02:53.200
time struggling to find themselves, especially their


2492
02:02:53.200 --> 02:02:56.000
Womanhood and their value as a person.


2493
02:02:57.500 --> 02:03:00.000
That's the key to Taurus Rising. Anyway, is that when you're talking about


2494
02:03:00.200 --> 02:03:03.700
the first house? It's the house of self Taurus rules


2495
02:03:03.700 --> 02:03:06.700
value. And with the North Node there. This is finding


2496
02:03:06.700 --> 02:03:09.900
over time. So as they get older, this


2497
02:03:09.900 --> 02:03:12.800
is a blessing for this person because as they get older it


2498
02:03:12.800 --> 02:03:13.800
looks like they don't even


2499
02:03:14.800 --> 02:03:17.500
Age especially with their sentence


2500
02:03:17.500 --> 02:03:17.600
here.


2501
02:03:19.700 --> 02:03:22.400
Opposing Neptune in


2502
02:03:22.400 --> 02:03:25.400
Scorpio here. This is like they don't look their


2503
02:03:25.400 --> 02:03:27.100
age. They would never look their age.


2504
02:03:27.900 --> 02:03:30.400
What would show difficulty making money or having to rely on


2505
02:03:30.400 --> 02:03:33.300
somebody else for money relying on somebody else for money is the rulers in


2506
02:03:33.300 --> 02:03:36.800
the Eighth House Scorpio is in the second house Pluto's in


2507
02:03:36.800 --> 02:03:39.300
the second house or there's something in the second house


2508
02:03:39.300 --> 02:03:42.900
that is linked to Pluto. So Pluto for


2509
02:03:42.900 --> 02:03:45.300
this person is 17 degrees.


2510
02:03:48.700 --> 02:03:49.000
the


2511
02:03:51.400 --> 02:03:55.200
This is the house of making money and then Venus is here. Venus's not


2512
02:03:54.200 --> 02:03:56.800
connected to Pluto.


2513
02:03:57.700 --> 02:04:00.500
here directly or Scorpio or the second house


2514
02:04:00.500 --> 02:04:02.300
and it is connected to


2515
02:04:03.600 --> 02:04:06.600
it is connected to the ruler of the second house


2516
02:04:06.600 --> 02:04:09.100
Wait. No, that's not Pluto is


2517
02:04:09.100 --> 02:04:09.400
not connected.


2518
02:04:10.100 --> 02:04:11.100
Scorpio is not connected.


2519
02:04:12.900 --> 02:04:16.300
There's a there's a trying here between Neptune and


2520
02:04:16.300 --> 02:04:18.000
Scorpio, but that's it's not money.


2521
02:04:21.200 --> 02:04:24.400
If they had if they had shared with this actually


2522
02:04:24.400 --> 02:04:27.300
says is that they would share their money


2523
02:04:27.300 --> 02:04:30.300
with their partners and their family. So this


2524
02:04:30.300 --> 02:04:31.100
is a generous person.


2525
02:04:32.200 --> 02:04:35.600
Generous Leo's generosity. Anyway, Leo and


2526
02:04:35.600 --> 02:04:39.000
the son both in the fourth house. This is somebody who heavily


2527
02:04:38.600 --> 02:04:42.200
identifies with their family is extremely generous


2528
02:04:41.200 --> 02:04:43.000
with their family.


2529
02:04:44.100 --> 02:04:47.800
And uses their career to help their family is literally


2530
02:04:47.800 --> 02:04:50.600
that type that's this type of person very compassionate


2531
02:04:50.600 --> 02:04:51.200
with other people.


2532
02:04:52.200 --> 02:04:54.800
but in terms of relationships


2533
02:04:56.100 --> 02:05:00.200
Not the easiest life for them, but in terms of career money stuff


2534
02:04:59.200 --> 02:05:02.100
like that. They've done


2535
02:05:02.100 --> 02:05:05.200
pretty well for themselves. But relying for other people and money


2536
02:05:05.200 --> 02:05:08.800
has a few different contexts. Sometimes Juno in the second house can also


2537
02:05:08.800 --> 02:05:10.500
mean that your partner brings you money.


2538
02:05:11.600 --> 02:05:15.100
But usually it has to do with Pluto placements. Sometimes it's


2539
02:05:15.100 --> 02:05:17.900
Pluto's in the first house in the first house rulers in the second house.


2540
02:05:20.900 --> 02:05:23.200
There's a lot of ways that I can actually play out. But


2541
02:05:23.200 --> 02:05:26.700
this is usually money or Venus in the eighth house could also


2542
02:05:26.700 --> 02:05:27.400
play out that way.


2543
02:05:28.700 --> 02:05:31.100
Or Venus connected to the Eighth House ruler can play out


2544
02:05:31.100 --> 02:05:31.600
that way as well.


2545
02:05:33.600 --> 02:05:36.900
Juno and Libra in the second house. There you go Libra in the second house also can


2546
02:05:36.900 --> 02:05:39.300
play out that way as well that you make money through


2547
02:05:39.300 --> 02:05:41.500
partnership or that your partner brings you money.


2548
02:05:42.500 --> 02:05:45.200
But like I said Juno in Libra in the second house


2549
02:05:45.200 --> 02:05:48.300
is that your partner could be very rich and you can


2550
02:05:48.300 --> 02:05:51.800
live off of them could be you have to look at all the aspects and


2551
02:05:51.800 --> 02:05:52.200
whatnot.


2552
02:05:53.500 --> 02:05:56.300
Depends on how and then you look at the rest of your charts. Like do


2553
02:05:56.300 --> 02:05:59.200
you feel that? That's something that you like? Is that something


2554
02:05:59.200 --> 02:06:02.400
that is beneficial to you or are you very driven and


2555
02:06:02.400 --> 02:06:05.200
and you don't like it like you could have a harsh aspect to it.


2556
02:06:05.200 --> 02:06:08.100
It's like it happens, but you don't really like that. It happens.


2557
02:06:11.600 --> 02:06:14.700
But yeah, so that would be your situation then if


2558
02:06:14.700 --> 02:06:15.400
that's what you have.


2559
02:06:16.300 --> 02:06:19.700
How you deal with it? And if it's something that you enjoy or that


2560
02:06:19.700 --> 02:06:22.200
works out in your favor is going to depend on


2561
02:06:22.200 --> 02:06:25.800
where Venus is how Venus's aspected because we're talking about Libra's ruler.


2562
02:06:26.500 --> 02:06:28.800
And then any aspects to Juno as well?


2563
02:06:31.100 --> 02:06:33.900
I see very interesting. Thank you. Welcome.


2564
02:06:34.700 --> 02:06:37.500
I see a lot of energy in the private part


2565
02:06:37.500 --> 02:06:38.300
of her chart.


2566
02:06:39.200 --> 02:06:42.300
Of the chart fourth house, but you said they are super


2567
02:06:42.300 --> 02:06:45.300
well known so big confused. Okay, so when we go back


2568
02:06:45.300 --> 02:06:45.500
here


2569
02:06:46.600 --> 02:06:47.100
they are.


2570
02:06:48.100 --> 02:06:51.200
It's a combination of you don't know much about them and you


2571
02:06:51.200 --> 02:06:54.300
know a lot about them at the same time, but they are a private person to


2572
02:06:54.300 --> 02:06:58.300
begin with they have the moon here in the fourth house which


2573
02:06:57.300 --> 02:07:00.300
keeps them very private the sun and the


2574
02:07:00.300 --> 02:07:03.500
fourth house very family oriented very like they Thrive at


2575
02:07:03.500 --> 02:07:06.100
home. They prefer to be kind of to themselves a bit.


2576
02:07:06.100 --> 02:07:09.500
You have the 12th house ruler, which is isolation down here


2577
02:07:09.500 --> 02:07:11.800
in the third house in


2578
02:07:14.200 --> 02:07:17.500
Cancer so this is somebody who would travel to be at


2579
02:07:17.500 --> 02:07:20.400
home. It's like if they had the ability to do so they


2580
02:07:20.400 --> 02:07:23.400
would either travel to have a home somewhere or they would travel to like


2581
02:07:23.400 --> 02:07:26.400
stay in the hotel and stay right around the hotel. They are


2582
02:07:26.400 --> 02:07:26.900
not somebody who


2583
02:07:28.300 --> 02:07:29.000
were Saturn


2584
02:07:30.300 --> 02:07:33.300
yeah, they don't like to explore much when they do travel right here


2585
02:07:33.300 --> 02:07:36.400
with Chiron and Neptune and then that's here. They


2586
02:07:36.400 --> 02:07:39.700
would only travel and explore out to like secret


2587
02:07:39.700 --> 02:07:42.400
places with a partner. Otherwise, they wouldn't do


2588
02:07:42.400 --> 02:07:42.400
it.


2589
02:07:43.200 --> 02:07:44.200
That's this energy here.


2590
02:07:46.200 --> 02:07:49.400
And then they have it here. Also, they go out in public with a partner


2591
02:07:49.400 --> 02:07:51.700
like this really when you only see them as if


2592
02:07:52.500 --> 02:07:55.400
if there's a partner or if there's something that has to do with like


2593
02:08:01.100 --> 02:08:04.500
Mars here. Yeah, if they're working you'll see them out if they're


2594
02:08:04.500 --> 02:08:07.200
working or if they're out with family or if they're with a


2595
02:08:07.200 --> 02:08:10.700
partner. That's really all you'll see them. But the reason why you you


2596
02:08:10.700 --> 02:08:12.300
do is because of this stellium here.


2597
02:08:13.200 --> 02:08:16.000
And that crosses over the third house ruler of fourth house and then you have


2598
02:08:16.500 --> 02:08:16.700
Jupiter here.


2599
02:08:17.500 --> 02:08:20.500
Jupiter is the rule of the eighth house that keeps this person. Also


2600
02:08:20.500 --> 02:08:24.100
very intimate. Very secretive right hidden


2601
02:08:23.100 --> 02:08:27.000
is the energy of this eighth house. It is


2602
02:08:26.300 --> 02:08:29.200
with the ruler of


2603
02:08:29.200 --> 02:08:31.700
the 12th house, which is also behind the scenes.


2604
02:08:32.600 --> 02:08:35.400
Don't it's like the vanishing energy here.


2605
02:08:36.500 --> 02:08:39.200
And then in that same house is Venus, which


2606
02:08:39.200 --> 02:08:40.400
is their chart ruler.


2607
02:08:41.500 --> 02:08:43.900
And but then it's it's straddles over here with.


2608
02:08:44.600 --> 02:08:48.000
The moon which is public what actually


2609
02:08:47.200 --> 02:08:50.600
makes them known and known


2610
02:08:50.600 --> 02:08:53.500
for being private is the fact that Venus is opposite


2611
02:08:53.500 --> 02:08:56.500
the midheaven, so they're stuff from internally is


2612
02:08:56.500 --> 02:08:57.500
put into their career.


2613
02:08:58.400 --> 02:09:01.800
So their career and their outward projection is


2614
02:09:01.800 --> 02:09:04.300
actually bringing energy from their private life.


2615
02:09:04.300 --> 02:09:06.900
So this is how you know the private but people know them.


2616
02:09:08.700 --> 02:09:09.500
Does that make sense?


2617
02:09:19.300 --> 02:09:23.500
They're 10th house career. And their Public Image is also LinkedIn with


2618
02:09:22.500 --> 02:09:25.100
the seventh house, which is


2619
02:09:25.100 --> 02:09:28.200
dealing with the public which they don't do too often. They would only do


2620
02:09:28.200 --> 02:09:28.300
that.


2621
02:09:29.300 --> 02:09:32.200
Come and go or for work. So they


2622
02:09:32.200 --> 02:09:35.300
don't really interact with the public either unless they're working and they probably


2623
02:09:35.300 --> 02:09:38.300
have issues with it. So they probably ship this person


2624
02:09:38.300 --> 02:09:41.600
probably has a hard time even doing like interviews and


2625
02:09:41.600 --> 02:09:42.800
stuff like that even for work.


2626
02:09:45.300 --> 02:09:48.600
I think so. I guess seeing an empty 10th house. My first impression wouldn't


2627
02:09:48.600 --> 02:09:51.000
be that they're well known. Ah, see that's the thing.


2628
02:09:51.500 --> 02:09:54.700
That's tiktok astrology. That's pop culture astrology. I


2629
02:09:54.700 --> 02:09:57.500
try so hard to tell people that empty houses


2630
02:09:57.500 --> 02:10:00.200
really don't mean anything. They definitely don't


2631
02:10:00.200 --> 02:10:03.200
mean they mean something but they don't mean what most people mean.


2632
02:10:04.300 --> 02:10:07.500
Or think they mean rather empty houses. Don't mean that these


2633
02:10:07.500 --> 02:10:10.200
things don't happen in your life. In fact, a lot


2634
02:10:10.200 --> 02:10:11.700
of stuff can happen career wise.


2635
02:10:12.700 --> 02:10:15.200
If you have a seventh house and it's empty


2636
02:10:15.200 --> 02:10:18.700
doesn't mean you're not going to get married. It just means that your focus


2637
02:10:18.700 --> 02:10:21.900
is not on the interaction one-to-one relationships


2638
02:10:21.900 --> 02:10:24.400
and the energy that energy is pulled somewhere


2639
02:10:24.400 --> 02:10:28.300
else. So if somebody is married for money.


2640
02:10:29.700 --> 02:10:31.600
That's too generic if somebody is.


2641
02:10:35.300 --> 02:10:38.600
If the contingencies upon a relationship have


2642
02:10:38.600 --> 02:10:41.100
to do with friendship, then you'll see potentially an empty house,


2643
02:10:41.100 --> 02:10:44.300
but you'll see either the seventh house ruler with


2644
02:10:44.300 --> 02:10:47.300
Uranus or in the 11th house and then you'll see a bunch of energy up in


2645
02:10:47.300 --> 02:10:50.400
the 11th house so networking. Hope streams future. The relationship


2646
02:10:50.400 --> 02:10:53.100
can be a huge part of their life, but


2647
02:10:53.100 --> 02:10:56.400
it's tied integrally integrally integrally.


2648
02:10:57.600 --> 02:11:00.400
Intricately whatever where you want to use to their hopes


2649
02:11:00.400 --> 02:11:04.500
dreams communication or not communication networking


2650
02:11:03.500 --> 02:11:07.100
technology friends


2651
02:11:06.100 --> 02:11:09.200
future all of that


2652
02:11:09.200 --> 02:11:11.600
kind of stuff Society. That's kind of how it is.


2653
02:11:13.800 --> 02:11:15.900
So that kind of ties all in together.


2654
02:11:17.100 --> 02:11:18.200
So seeing an empty house.


2655
02:11:19.200 --> 02:11:22.500
Doesn't mean that they're not going to be well known. It doesn't mean that they're not gonna


2656
02:11:22.500 --> 02:11:25.200
have a career. You have to look at the ruler. The ruler of


2657
02:11:25.200 --> 02:11:28.500
the 10th house is Pluto Pluto's Power by the way, so this person


2658
02:11:28.500 --> 02:11:30.600
is powerfully known.


2659
02:11:32.100 --> 02:11:35.700
For fifth house stuff working in entertainment


2660
02:11:35.700 --> 02:11:39.100
working with Children Health of


2661
02:11:38.100 --> 02:11:41.600
children. We talked about gambling we


2662
02:11:41.600 --> 02:11:44.400
talked about romance, that could also be a part of it. It


2663
02:11:44.400 --> 02:11:47.600
doesn't always have to be one thing. It can be multiple things. But this


2664
02:11:47.600 --> 02:11:49.000
person has that here.


2665
02:11:56.400 --> 02:11:59.200
I hope that makes sense. And I think that's a very valid point


2666
02:11:59.200 --> 02:12:00.400
very valid question because


2667
02:12:01.300 --> 02:12:04.100
all over freaking social media. I see it all


2668
02:12:04.100 --> 02:12:06.900
the time people like oh empty house means you're not going to have this.


2669
02:12:08.200 --> 02:12:11.700
Does that mean an empty first house means you don't exist? Because the


2670
02:12:11.700 --> 02:12:14.600
first house is the house of self. So everybody who


2671
02:12:14.600 --> 02:12:17.600
has an empty house. I have an empty first house my ascendance sits


2672
02:12:17.600 --> 02:12:21.100
there but there's nothing else in my first house. Does that mean I have no identity that


2673
02:12:20.100 --> 02:12:24.200
I don't do anything. No because just


2674
02:12:23.200 --> 02:12:25.600
because it's empty just means that I don't


2675
02:12:28.400 --> 02:12:31.200
the different areas of my life are not hyper focused on


2676
02:12:31.200 --> 02:12:34.400
to me my physical body in every action that I do people with


2677
02:12:34.400 --> 02:12:35.400
stuff in the first house.


2678
02:12:37.600 --> 02:12:40.600
They're living in my experience or my not experience


2679
02:12:40.600 --> 02:12:43.200
because I don't have anything the first house but in my experience of


2680
02:12:43.200 --> 02:12:46.600
reading people's charts in my opinion, they have harder lives


2681
02:12:46.600 --> 02:12:48.800
than other people because everything relies on them.


2682
02:12:49.500 --> 02:12:52.000
You know their happiness relies on them if it's the sun in the


2683
02:12:52.100 --> 02:12:55.700
first house there which I mean can be great because you can literally make


2684
02:12:55.700 --> 02:12:56.900
your own your own happiness.


2685
02:12:57.900 --> 02:13:01.000
Your health relies on what you do some people's


2686
02:13:00.200 --> 02:13:03.300
health is just naturally good doesn't matter if they're lazy or


2687
02:13:03.300 --> 02:13:07.000
they move around they eat whatever they want. But other people it's


2688
02:13:06.700 --> 02:13:09.400
you know, what they do, whether they're Physically


2689
02:13:09.400 --> 02:13:12.100
Active literally determines their health that there's six


2690
02:13:12.100 --> 02:13:13.000
house rulers in the first house.


2691
02:13:14.300 --> 02:13:15.300
It can create health problems.


2692
02:13:16.200 --> 02:13:19.500
Very easily because their health is literally determined on


2693
02:13:19.500 --> 02:13:22.300
every action they make and that could be very frustrating for


2694
02:13:22.300 --> 02:13:25.300
some of these people. So some people have certain areas. Like I


2695
02:13:25.300 --> 02:13:28.700
said with this person their career has struggles has


2696
02:13:28.700 --> 02:13:31.400
issues their friendships have struggles and


2697
02:13:31.400 --> 02:13:34.500
issues their relationships have more


2698
02:13:34.500 --> 02:13:37.200
struggles and issues. But all of us have struggles and issues. They


2699
02:13:37.200 --> 02:13:40.100
need to turn this around for them. They need to find their identity in their


2700
02:13:40.100 --> 02:13:43.800
own worth through, you know, family potentially


2701
02:13:43.800 --> 02:13:46.200
starting their own family or an extended family or something along


2702
02:13:46.200 --> 02:13:46.800
those lines.


2703
02:13:48.100 --> 02:13:48.800
Well this class.


2704
02:13:49.600 --> 02:13:52.600
Recording me uploaded before your Astro class tomorrow is hoping


2705
02:13:52.600 --> 02:13:56.300
to catch up before then. But yes this all making sense. I doubt


2706
02:13:55.300 --> 02:13:56.400
it.


2707
02:13:57.900 --> 02:14:00.500
Sorry, I'll try


2708
02:14:00.500 --> 02:14:03.400
but I don't know that I can get it up that quickly because it


2709
02:14:03.400 --> 02:14:06.200
has to process then have to


2710
02:14:06.200 --> 02:14:09.900
run it through post. Then I have to edit which isn't


2711
02:14:09.900 --> 02:14:12.300
doesn't take that long. Then I have to export it. Then. I


2712
02:14:12.300 --> 02:14:15.800
have to upload it and then I have to do a stuff bunch of stuff with learnworlds


2713
02:14:15.800 --> 02:14:18.300
and Vimeo and then


2714
02:14:18.300 --> 02:14:21.200
I could put it I will try but it's a lot


2715
02:14:21.200 --> 02:14:22.000
of work to get it up.


2716
02:14:23.400 --> 02:14:26.400
Will try everything's making sense. Cool.


2717
02:14:29.300 --> 02:14:32.500
All right Taylor. That was you and


2718
02:14:32.500 --> 02:14:35.200
Ashley. I can agree with that Virgo Rising here with


2719
02:14:35.200 --> 02:14:37.200
Chiron the first house. Yeah like that just


2720
02:14:38.700 --> 02:14:41.500
Virgo Rising is Health all the time. And Chiron


2721
02:14:41.500 --> 02:14:41.800
is like


2722
02:14:42.900 --> 02:14:44.100
having to be very cautious.


2723
02:14:45.500 --> 02:14:48.500
With things that you do for Chiron, the first house is also


2724
02:14:48.500 --> 02:14:50.100
you know, and we talk about this all the time.


2725
02:14:50.900 --> 02:14:53.300
You know, it's one of 12 possible placements. So


2726
02:14:53.300 --> 02:14:56.300
a lot of people in the world have this but Chiron in the first house is


2727
02:14:56.300 --> 02:14:58.100
a lot of perceived.


2728
02:14:58.900 --> 02:15:01.700
And Virgo it's nitpicking over everything


2729
02:15:01.700 --> 02:15:04.600
because Virgo so critical very good


2730
02:15:04.600 --> 02:15:07.200
with details, but often goes too far and becomes


2731
02:15:07.200 --> 02:15:10.300
critical but criticizing your body to the point where you become so


2732
02:15:10.300 --> 02:15:13.600
insecure that it literally affects everything.


2733
02:15:13.600 --> 02:15:16.200
That's the trouble with the first house in my opinion not trouble,


2734
02:15:16.200 --> 02:15:19.700
but the challenge of the first house is that you're


2735
02:15:19.700 --> 02:15:20.300
so


2736
02:15:21.100 --> 02:15:24.200
Everything you do. It's literally your physical body and everything


2737
02:15:24.200 --> 02:15:27.700
you do. So and the first house impacts all together 11


2738
02:15:27.700 --> 02:15:28.100
houses.


2739
02:15:29.500 --> 02:15:32.600
So the focus has to be there. So the healing for you for anyone


2740
02:15:32.600 --> 02:15:33.700
with Cairo in the first house.


2741
02:15:34.400 --> 02:15:38.100
The healing needs to be the manifestation class may help you.


2742
02:15:39.600 --> 02:15:42.300
Kind of hone in on this because you'll take that energy


2743
02:15:42.300 --> 02:15:45.600
and you'll start healing and when you start healing you'll


2744
02:15:45.600 --> 02:15:48.300
start helping other people at the same thing and then you'll then be healing


2745
02:15:48.300 --> 02:15:51.400
yourself and then you'll start noticing every other aspect of


2746
02:15:51.400 --> 02:15:55.600
your life. We'll just magically magically become


2747
02:15:54.600 --> 02:15:57.900
better because you're not insecure


2748
02:15:57.900 --> 02:16:00.100
about yourself your healing, you know


2749
02:16:00.100 --> 02:16:03.600
that you're a Healer that you can help other people that your


2750
02:16:03.600 --> 02:16:06.300
detail orientedness is actually a really positive


2751
02:16:06.300 --> 02:16:09.200
thing until it goes too far and then you can help other


2752
02:16:09.200 --> 02:16:12.400
people it all the time as long as you don't take it too far if


2753
02:16:12.400 --> 02:16:15.900
the balance out the first and the seventh house astrology in


2754
02:16:15.900 --> 02:16:17.500
general is all about balance.


2755
02:16:18.900 --> 02:16:21.600
So once people understand balance and they


2756
02:16:21.600 --> 02:16:25.100
really hone in this and they understand their conflicts between


2757
02:16:24.100 --> 02:16:27.900
like this person really wants


2758
02:16:27.900 --> 02:16:30.300
to make a name that this is interesting because in


2759
02:16:30.300 --> 02:16:34.900
the fourth house but in entertainment this person strives for


2760
02:16:34.900 --> 02:16:37.600
the next thing right because


2761
02:16:37.600 --> 02:16:40.900
the ascendant and the sun which literally


2762
02:16:40.900 --> 02:16:43.500
in entertainment what not. This person is always


2763
02:16:43.500 --> 02:16:46.200
a hard worker always trying to do the next thing


2764
02:16:46.200 --> 02:16:49.300
always trying to put themselves out there make a name for themselves and


2765
02:16:49.300 --> 02:16:53.700
keep themselves alive through their own


2766
02:16:53.700 --> 02:16:56.400
actions and this actually extends Way Beyond


2767
02:16:56.400 --> 02:16:59.700
career, but we're in the lens of career. So


2768
02:16:59.700 --> 02:17:02.200
in terms of career, this person is constant. This


2769
02:17:02.200 --> 02:17:06.100
is a very diligent worker sometimes to their own detriment


2770
02:17:05.100 --> 02:17:08.300
like they can really wear themselves out. I would imagine that


2771
02:17:08.300 --> 02:17:11.500
in entertainment. This person is the person who's on set on stage,


2772
02:17:11.500 --> 02:17:14.800
whatever well beyond when they're


2773
02:17:14.800 --> 02:17:15.000
needed.


2774
02:17:15.700 --> 02:17:18.500
Mmm, and this also they're obsessed


2775
02:17:18.500 --> 02:17:19.200
with what they do.


2776
02:17:20.500 --> 02:17:23.100
Here especially if they have friends involved. It's like


2777
02:17:23.100 --> 02:17:26.900
that's probably their perfect thing. So here's what I'm going to do here. Are


2778
02:17:26.900 --> 02:17:29.600
there any other questions before I


2779
02:17:29.600 --> 02:17:32.300
do something that I consider a little bit of a


2780
02:17:32.300 --> 02:17:32.800
plot twist?


2781
02:17:34.300 --> 02:17:37.200
Here, I'll give you a second to type a question. If you're


2782
02:17:37.200 --> 02:17:40.700
at home. You guys can go back real quick review some things


2783
02:17:40.700 --> 02:17:43.500
check it out and kind


2784
02:17:43.500 --> 02:17:46.300
of see how everything plays out in your chart.


2785
02:17:46.300 --> 02:17:49.600
This was the third chart that we did we talked about the notoriety that


2786
02:17:49.600 --> 02:17:52.300
we see here, even though empty houses, which is a great topic to


2787
02:17:52.300 --> 02:17:52.600
talk about


2788
02:17:53.500 --> 02:17:54.400
the second one


2789
02:17:55.200 --> 02:17:55.900
we talked about.


2790
02:17:57.700 --> 02:17:58.800
the not so fun


2791
02:17:59.600 --> 02:18:02.000
possibility here. I actually want to


2792
02:18:02.300 --> 02:18:06.200
Google something real quick of a potential issue with a


2793
02:18:05.200 --> 02:18:08.900
child first child first born and


2794
02:18:08.900 --> 02:18:11.200
then this one here this person


2795
02:18:11.200 --> 02:18:14.800
we talked about their love life always being on display lots


2796
02:18:14.800 --> 02:18:17.600
of issues within love specifically in Romance,


2797
02:18:17.600 --> 02:18:19.400
and then we even talk to touch about


2798
02:18:22.600 --> 02:18:23.000
their


2799
02:18:25.200 --> 02:18:28.200
first child being a part of that in their romance. They're intimacy issues. That


2800
02:18:28.200 --> 02:18:28.400
was


2801
02:18:29.200 --> 02:18:30.500
what we talked about


2802
02:19:45.900 --> 02:19:48.200
Now what's interesting here is every time you go


2803
02:19:48.200 --> 02:19:52.900
back to a chart. You can look at things and see some things


2804
02:19:52.900 --> 02:19:52.900
here.


2805
02:19:54.300 --> 02:19:55.300
are not private


2806
02:19:59.600 --> 02:20:00.200
some things are


2807
02:20:03.400 --> 02:20:04.400
11 and 11


2808
02:20:07.400 --> 02:20:08.200
That's a shrine.


2809
02:20:09.800 --> 02:20:12.300
I missed this when I looked here the chart


2810
02:20:12.300 --> 02:20:15.300
rulers in the first house. That's not a loss.


2811
02:20:16.100 --> 02:20:19.300
This is the problem with it is there's so much information you go back. That's not


2812
02:20:19.300 --> 02:20:22.900
a loss. So this is an illusion. This is this is a loss but


2813
02:20:22.900 --> 02:20:25.300
it's not a loss of life. This is a loss of


2814
02:20:26.400 --> 02:20:26.900
connection


2815
02:20:28.400 --> 02:20:31.100
So this one little aspect changes this entire


2816
02:20:31.100 --> 02:20:31.600
thing here.


2817
02:20:33.200 --> 02:20:35.300
And I looked it up to verify because I had a feeling.


2818
02:20:36.600 --> 02:20:38.100
This right here this 11:11.


2819
02:20:39.100 --> 02:20:42.500
Is not a loss is a connection a deep connection actually.


2820
02:20:43.300 --> 02:20:46.300
But Chiron here, there's definitely an issue that happened


2821
02:20:46.300 --> 02:20:47.200
at 28 so.


2822
02:20:48.100 --> 02:20:50.600
That's something to look into what we're going to talk about that in a minute.


2823
02:20:52.200 --> 02:20:55.200
Could I have a super quick General brief overview what we


2824
02:20:55.200 --> 02:20:56.400
talked about in the beginning of class?


2825
02:20:58.300 --> 02:21:01.300
I gotta be honest. I don't remember everything. I talked about the beginning of


2826
02:21:01.300 --> 02:21:01.500
class.


2827
02:21:02.300 --> 02:21:06.800
I basically talked about lenses breaking


2828
02:21:05.800 --> 02:21:08.600
down each topic into subparts.


2829
02:21:12.100 --> 02:21:13.000
diving deeper


2830
02:21:14.600 --> 02:21:17.500
by connecting everything and going through layers.


2831
02:21:20.800 --> 02:21:23.200
Realizing that if you try to do a full natal chart


2832
02:21:23.200 --> 02:21:25.000
that it's very difficult to do that.


2833
02:21:27.800 --> 02:21:30.300
Because there's just too much information and you're not looking at


2834
02:21:30.300 --> 02:21:32.500
anything and everything is done through lenses.


2835
02:21:37.400 --> 02:21:38.200
Any bit of context?


2836
02:21:42.800 --> 02:21:45.300
Pluto retrograde so Pluto retrograde


2837
02:21:48.800 --> 02:21:51.700
in this chart see this is this is well Pluto


2838
02:21:51.700 --> 02:21:53.400
Works in inwardly internally.


2839
02:22:01.500 --> 02:22:04.100
So when it comes to the 12th house, this is


2840
02:22:04.100 --> 02:22:07.500
you know spiritual this is anything has to do with music or


2841
02:22:07.500 --> 02:22:10.300
film or anything in the subconscious. This is


2842
02:22:10.300 --> 02:22:13.800
a lot of like repressed psychological stuff. That


2843
02:22:13.800 --> 02:22:17.100
would need to be handled Pluto inwardly is


2844
02:22:16.100 --> 02:22:17.500
a


2845
02:22:18.500 --> 02:22:21.200
all the changes and all the psychology has to be dealt with on


2846
02:22:21.200 --> 02:22:24.700
your own like you can't do the Transformations outwardly. He has


2847
02:22:24.700 --> 02:22:27.800
to transform spiritually in order


2848
02:22:27.800 --> 02:22:30.300
to and I know who this is, but it has


2849
02:22:30.300 --> 02:22:33.200
to transform spiritually inwardly to kind of


2850
02:22:33.200 --> 02:22:36.200
help other people want a spiritual level. This is


2851
02:22:36.200 --> 02:22:36.600
something that would


2852
02:22:37.300 --> 02:22:38.300
happen over time


2853
02:22:39.900 --> 02:22:42.500
because the North Node this is actually who this person's


2854
02:22:42.500 --> 02:22:45.300
supposed to grow into this person here is supposed to


2855
02:22:45.300 --> 02:22:46.000
grow into


2856
02:22:48.300 --> 02:22:51.200
their the public family the Public Image,


2857
02:22:51.200 --> 02:22:54.200
which is interesting. This person is supposed to grow into their


2858
02:22:54.200 --> 02:22:57.600
Public Image and their career and this person is supposed to grow into


2859
02:22:57.600 --> 02:22:59.900
themselves grow into who they are.


2860
02:23:30.900 --> 02:23:32.000
Okay, cool.


2861
02:23:37.100 --> 02:23:39.500
Would you consider Aries in relationships?


2862
02:23:40.500 --> 02:23:43.400
To for the sense of passion. Yes,


2863
02:23:43.400 --> 02:23:44.000
absolutely.


2864
02:23:46.200 --> 02:23:49.600
Yeah areas means passion. So it's not intimacy


2865
02:23:49.600 --> 02:23:53.900
though. It is Passion like lust sex the


2866
02:23:52.900 --> 02:23:55.200
the drive and the motivation


2867
02:23:55.200 --> 02:23:58.100
and the want when you're talking about areas here,


2868
02:23:58.100 --> 02:23:58.900
so when you're looking


2869
02:24:00.400 --> 02:24:03.500
At this person. This was the second person that this


2870
02:24:03.500 --> 02:24:04.600
is you know,


2871
02:24:06.900 --> 02:24:09.500
you know, they can be well this person could


2872
02:24:09.500 --> 02:24:11.000
be selfish in relationships, but


2873
02:24:11.800 --> 02:24:13.900
And we talked about children for this one.


2874
02:24:14.900 --> 02:24:17.600
But there is the moon


2875
02:24:17.600 --> 02:24:18.800
here. So this person like


2876
02:24:20.300 --> 02:24:24.600
feels a need for relationship. But here's the thing is while Libra's


2877
02:24:23.600 --> 02:24:26.500
can have that issue of being selfish within


2878
02:24:26.500 --> 02:24:29.700
relationships. They can also find themselves within relationships, which


2879
02:24:29.700 --> 02:24:30.300
is the goal.


2880
02:24:31.200 --> 02:24:34.200
And with here with the Moon it comes through their


2881
02:24:34.200 --> 02:24:37.300
career that they find themselves in the relationships. Their partner would


2882
02:24:37.300 --> 02:24:38.800
be very much a part of their career.


2883
02:24:39.800 --> 02:24:42.200
And the ruler is down here


2884
02:24:42.200 --> 02:24:43.300
in the fifth house with.


2885
02:24:46.300 --> 02:24:49.300
with Venus, so there would be the first because there's Chiron here


2886
02:24:49.300 --> 02:24:51.200
the first relationship with likely be


2887
02:24:52.400 --> 02:24:57.000
tough a split up a breakup or anything like that likely


2888
02:24:55.400 --> 02:24:58.500
the first relationship there


2889
02:24:58.500 --> 02:24:59.900
would be a child at least a child.


2890
02:25:00.700 --> 02:25:03.000
Whereas Uranus and Uranus is up


2891
02:25:03.200 --> 02:25:05.500
here in Leo, so that's kind of doubles down on that.


2892
02:25:06.200 --> 02:25:09.400
Or there will be children involved. So either they had


2893
02:25:09.400 --> 02:25:11.800
children or their children involved or something like that, but


2894
02:25:13.800 --> 02:25:16.700
With this here. There's a there's a definite friendship and


2895
02:25:16.700 --> 02:25:17.100
partnership here.


2896
02:25:17.900 --> 02:25:20.800
So this person the Aries


2897
02:25:20.800 --> 02:25:23.400
doesn't play out negatively. This person is very


2898
02:25:23.400 --> 02:25:25.300
romantically connected on a very


2899
02:25:26.700 --> 02:25:30.100
Public, you know people know that this


2900
02:25:29.100 --> 02:25:31.900
person with their relationships.


2901
02:25:37.400 --> 02:25:38.100
This is very interesting.


2902
02:25:39.800 --> 02:25:42.300
It all like you do have to look at the sign you


2903
02:25:42.300 --> 02:25:45.700
have to look at the planets and you definitely have to look at the rulership and


2904
02:25:45.700 --> 02:25:46.700
all the aspects to it.


2905
02:25:47.700 --> 02:25:50.600
So I'm going to show you trying to figure out this issue


2906
02:25:50.600 --> 02:25:53.200
here with the child because there is some confusion here.


2907
02:25:53.200 --> 02:25:56.400
I'm gonna figure out exactly what it is, but the first person


2908
02:25:56.400 --> 02:25:57.800
here it is.


2909
02:25:58.900 --> 02:26:01.100
These are real people by the way, and they're people


2910
02:26:01.100 --> 02:26:04.100
that you can look up so you can prove whether or not anything I said


2911
02:26:04.100 --> 02:26:07.200
was right or wrong the second person. I'm a little off and this


2912
02:26:07.200 --> 02:26:10.300
is where you have to go back and figure out why I knew


2913
02:26:10.300 --> 02:26:13.200
that the first thing that I got wrong was the ascendant and the


2914
02:26:13.200 --> 02:26:16.100
Venus here that the relationships are part of who they are. Yeah, we weren't talking about


2915
02:26:16.100 --> 02:26:19.900
they were talking about children. This means that children is not gone. There's


2916
02:26:19.900 --> 02:26:22.400
an ascendant Venus direct trying


2917
02:26:22.400 --> 02:26:25.400
which means the person is very much alive, but


2918
02:26:25.400 --> 02:26:28.800
there is an on and off there is a not seeing the value


2919
02:26:28.800 --> 02:26:31.500
here there is still a loss and there's Cairo and


2920
02:26:31.500 --> 02:26:34.600
there's still pain and wound. We're gonna find out because I'm gonna google it while I'm


2921
02:26:34.600 --> 02:26:37.900
live to figure out because I'm concerned with what


2922
02:26:37.900 --> 02:26:39.600
this is first person though.


2923
02:26:40.900 --> 02:26:43.300
And this is the things you're reading energy. You are an


2924
02:26:43.300 --> 02:26:45.600
interpreter. So you want to figure out how and why?


2925
02:26:46.700 --> 02:26:47.300
first person


2926
02:26:49.200 --> 02:26:52.300
Britney Spears this person that


2927
02:26:52.300 --> 02:26:55.400
we were talking to we're talking about her love life. We didn't


2928
02:26:55.400 --> 02:26:58.400
talk about career. We didn't talk about family too much.


2929
02:26:58.400 --> 02:27:01.100
We didn't really talk about much we did talk about our first child. We did talk


2930
02:27:01.100 --> 02:27:04.400
about this. I picked three people that I don't know much about


2931
02:27:04.400 --> 02:27:07.200
I've listened to her music. I know


2932
02:27:07.200 --> 02:27:08.500
all my friends were into her.


2933
02:27:09.500 --> 02:27:12.800
I was just I was not really a part of that. So I


2934
02:27:12.800 --> 02:27:15.800
don't know much about her. I know that there was a conservatorship


2935
02:27:15.800 --> 02:27:18.400
we didn't talk about that. I know that it


2936
02:27:18.400 --> 02:27:21.500
recently ended because my wife was talking about it today. The reason


2937
02:27:21.500 --> 02:27:24.400
why she popped in my head is because there was a random conversation about her. But


2938
02:27:24.400 --> 02:27:27.200
the first person we talked about was a Britney Spears.


2939
02:27:28.100 --> 02:27:31.200
The second person who I see from time to time


2940
02:27:31.200 --> 02:27:34.500
and I like what he has to say, but I don't know hardly anything


2941
02:27:34.500 --> 02:27:37.900
about him is a Tony Robbins. Now this


2942
02:27:37.900 --> 02:27:40.100
person is very intriguing to me


2943
02:27:40.100 --> 02:27:41.700
because while I was reading the chart


2944
02:27:42.900 --> 02:27:45.200
My brain works funky like this is I'm reading


2945
02:27:45.200 --> 02:27:50.100
the chart for this person's child and family, and I'm


2946
02:27:49.100 --> 02:27:50.800
also reading.


2947
02:27:51.800 --> 02:27:54.000
Other stuff in their chart about you know,


2948
02:27:54.800 --> 02:27:57.500
their career and their love life and their your goals


2949
02:27:57.500 --> 02:28:00.400
and stuff like that. So very interesting that their


2950
02:28:00.400 --> 02:28:03.200
goals involve Tech. I did hear this guy invested in Tech


2951
02:28:03.200 --> 02:28:06.000
and Boop. There it is. So we would have


2952
02:28:07.400 --> 02:28:10.200
used entertainment to get that and the things


2953
02:28:10.200 --> 02:28:13.200
that he invests in our wow. It doesn't matter. That was


2954
02:28:13.200 --> 02:28:14.100
Tony Robbins chart.


2955
02:28:14.800 --> 02:28:17.200
I want to figure out the thing with the first because it doesn't say


2956
02:28:17.200 --> 02:28:20.700
his first child died. But there's a whole thing


2957
02:28:20.700 --> 02:28:23.700
around his first children. There's a conspiracy around


2958
02:28:23.700 --> 02:28:26.500
it. And then there's also like a first girlfriend who had


2959
02:28:26.500 --> 02:28:28.300
there were multiple children involved.


2960
02:28:30.300 --> 02:28:33.300
which is really interesting so we'll have to figure out where


2961
02:28:33.300 --> 02:28:35.700
that went off a little bit and then here is


2962
02:28:38.100 --> 02:28:41.200
and I don't mind admitting that there's no such thing as a perfect


2963
02:28:41.200 --> 02:28:44.100
astrologer, but you're tying it together in the amount of


2964
02:28:44.100 --> 02:28:45.200
detail you do get out of this.


2965
02:28:46.400 --> 02:28:48.500
Is important third person we talked about the career.


2966
02:28:49.300 --> 02:28:52.100
I know nothing about this person aside from like


2967
02:28:52.100 --> 02:28:55.100
one or two movies. This person has been in but everyone else knows a


2968
02:28:55.100 --> 02:28:56.900
lot about them. It's Halle Berry.


2969
02:28:57.800 --> 02:29:00.200
I picked these three people five minutes


2970
02:29:00.200 --> 02:29:03.300
before I started this class and just looked up their birth


2971
02:29:03.300 --> 02:29:06.300
time to see you know, their natal charts and find


2972
02:29:06.300 --> 02:29:09.400
people that we could find birth times for that were


2973
02:29:09.400 --> 02:29:13.300
documented. And this was the third person. So this is Halle


2974
02:29:12.300 --> 02:29:15.600
Berry's I know nothing about her romantic relationship


2975
02:29:15.600 --> 02:29:18.100
or if she has children or anything like


2976
02:29:18.100 --> 02:29:21.300
that. To be honest with you. It doesn't appear that she has children and


2977
02:29:21.300 --> 02:29:24.500
if she does it's likely through a relationship if she


2978
02:29:24.500 --> 02:29:27.400
were to and it would happen later in life because she's been searching her whole


2979
02:29:27.400 --> 02:29:28.900
life to figure out who she is.


2980
02:29:29.700 --> 02:29:32.500
But yeah, that is it shows that


2981
02:29:32.500 --> 02:29:35.200
she's entertainment shows that she's well known you can see that the


2982
02:29:35.200 --> 02:29:38.900
10th house here and I don't usually do celebrity.


2983
02:29:40.100 --> 02:29:40.300
stuff


2984
02:29:41.500 --> 02:29:44.300
But I decided to do it this way in the car


2985
02:29:44.300 --> 02:29:47.000
about two hours ago. I was like, you know, it'd be kind of


2986
02:29:47.200 --> 02:29:50.300
fun. If I did three random charts, but didn't no one knew we


2987
02:29:50.300 --> 02:29:53.400
were looking into a celebrity's chart, but I don't want to do politicians or


2988
02:29:53.400 --> 02:29:53.800
anything like that.


2989
02:29:57.000 --> 02:29:57.400
So


2990
02:29:59.100 --> 02:30:01.500
of course that's showed up my search history.


2991
02:30:02.900 --> 02:30:05.100
Glad nothing crazy showed up.


2992
02:30:07.300 --> 02:30:08.500
Tony Robbins


2993
02:30:09.700 --> 02:30:13.000
first child, let's find out live what's


2994
02:30:12.200 --> 02:30:14.700
going on with this first kit here, so


2995
02:30:17.300 --> 02:30:21.400
84 Father Charles Elizabeth Acosta personal


2996
02:30:20.400 --> 02:30:23.200
empowerment coach and trainer that


2997
02:30:23.200 --> 02:30:26.600
makes sense because chiron's being used positively there. But there's


2998
02:30:26.600 --> 02:30:29.700
this whole thing about a child at 14. There's


2999
02:30:29.700 --> 02:30:30.300
another one.


3000
02:30:31.400 --> 02:30:32.400
that the


3001
02:30:33.600 --> 02:30:34.900
former where I just read it.


3002
02:30:43.100 --> 02:30:45.600
There's this whole thing and then another marriage here.


3003
02:30:46.700 --> 02:30:48.100
And we know that the marriage.


3004
02:30:49.500 --> 02:30:50.700
oops this one


3005
02:30:51.600 --> 02:30:54.100
We know that the marriage here is tied in with Chiron. So we


3006
02:30:54.100 --> 02:30:57.300
know there are relationship issues that have to be worked on which


3007
02:30:57.300 --> 02:31:00.800
would have happened over time. We know that the relationships were


3008
02:31:00.800 --> 02:31:01.400
public.


3009
02:31:02.100 --> 02:31:03.900
first child


3010
02:31:06.900 --> 02:31:07.900
are there any issues?


3011
02:31:10.500 --> 02:31:13.200
There's mommy issues, but we didn't look into that.


3012
02:31:18.900 --> 02:31:20.500
There's something secretive about all this.


3013
02:31:22.200 --> 02:31:24.600
This is talking again talking about child at 24.


3014
02:31:29.700 --> 02:31:32.800
This is his childhood pituitary tumor in


3015
02:31:32.800 --> 02:31:36.000
his brain. So the whole brain thing was actually not off his


3016
02:31:35.400 --> 02:31:38.700
childhood that I


3017
02:31:38.700 --> 02:31:39.000
was reading.


3018
02:31:39.900 --> 02:31:42.700
And this is where it gets a little confusing. So I'm I


3019
02:31:42.700 --> 02:31:43.400
actually didn't even know this.


3020
02:31:44.300 --> 02:31:47.500
So when I was talking about the the brain stuff


3021
02:31:47.500 --> 02:31:51.000
and and the issue and but it's


3022
02:31:50.500 --> 02:31:53.800
still and then I came back and said that there's not


3023
02:31:53.800 --> 02:31:56.200
a loss or death there is loss and there's definitely a


3024
02:31:56.200 --> 02:31:58.500
conflict in something that had to do with health and the Brain.


3025
02:31:59.500 --> 02:32:03.000
Here that that was actually accurate


3026
02:32:02.200 --> 02:32:05.200
and there's some sort of growth. This was the expansion that


3027
02:32:05.200 --> 02:32:08.000
was talking about. So that's interesting fifth house.


3028
02:32:08.900 --> 02:32:11.000
And I'm you know what? I'm glad that I messed up a little


3029
02:32:11.100 --> 02:32:14.200
bit here because the other thing that no one talks about about the


3030
02:32:14.200 --> 02:32:17.500
fifth house and everyone says the fourth house in the ICS your


3031
02:32:17.500 --> 02:32:20.000
childhood and it is but no one actually talks about the fact that


3032
02:32:20.400 --> 02:32:23.800
the fifth house is also your childhood just


3033
02:32:23.800 --> 02:32:26.500
like the 10th house is you being a father and


3034
02:32:26.500 --> 02:32:28.500
the 4th house is you being a mother.


3035
02:32:29.700 --> 02:32:32.200
And the 7th houses you being


3036
02:32:32.200 --> 02:32:35.400
a partner, right? They don't talk about those types of things and


3037
02:32:35.400 --> 02:32:38.200
I think those are extremely important. So sometimes it's very


3038
02:32:38.200 --> 02:32:41.400
difficult to decipher the energies and I should have a revisit here


3039
02:32:41.400 --> 02:32:44.500
after this class. I'm going to revisit Tony Robbins


3040
02:32:44.500 --> 02:32:44.800
chart because


3041
02:32:45.700 --> 02:32:47.900
I don't know much about him, but it's fascinating here.


3042
02:32:49.300 --> 02:32:51.500
That there is definitely well. This is the separation we saw.


3043
02:32:52.500 --> 02:32:55.200
This is the having the children. This is the on and


3044
02:32:55.200 --> 02:32:56.300
off again not seeing the child.


3045
02:32:59.100 --> 02:33:02.300
That child became an actor. That's this. I didn't dive that deeply


3046
02:33:02.300 --> 02:33:06.100
but this is the wound. So with the other children, there


3047
02:33:05.100 --> 02:33:08.900
are the there's a connection here as well. I


3048
02:33:08.900 --> 02:33:11.400
read something quickly. I couldn't find it while I


3049
02:33:11.400 --> 02:33:13.700
showed you live, but I read something about like two or three other kids.


3050
02:33:14.700 --> 02:33:17.600
Or something so that would make sense that they're all this one this


3051
02:33:17.600 --> 02:33:18.500
one and this one.


3052
02:33:19.300 --> 02:33:23.600
Are all tied back into this any further


3053
02:33:23.600 --> 02:33:26.500
children Leo are indirectly tied


3054
02:33:26.500 --> 02:33:29.800
in this one here would be directly tied in so I got


3055
02:33:29.800 --> 02:33:32.200
to look into it. Tony's Robin's children


3056
02:33:32.200 --> 02:33:35.800
are five. But only two of them are his biological.


3057
02:33:35.800 --> 02:33:37.100
So there's the other thing.


3058
02:33:41.200 --> 02:33:44.300
Apparently and I guess I got to find a valid


3059
02:33:44.300 --> 02:33:46.900
source as well because these are all saying something different.


3060
02:33:47.900 --> 02:33:49.600
So there was apparently an affair.


3061
02:33:50.200 --> 02:33:53.400
His first child was through an affair that makes sense. So if


3062
02:33:53.400 --> 02:33:56.700
you read this that there was relationship issues


3063
02:33:56.700 --> 02:33:58.000
and through cheating.


3064
02:33:59.400 --> 02:34:00.500
Eighth House


3065
02:34:01.800 --> 02:34:04.300
ruler with Mars that


3066
02:34:04.300 --> 02:34:07.300
actually makes sense that there would be cheating in the first one and that


3067
02:34:07.300 --> 02:34:10.000
would create an issue with the first marriage that I can


3068
02:34:10.300 --> 02:34:13.500
see so that piece of information resonates with


3069
02:34:13.500 --> 02:34:14.600
the chart.


3070
02:34:15.400 --> 02:34:18.700
But his childhood, yeah, that's that's the the


3071
02:34:18.700 --> 02:34:19.200
brain thing.


3072
02:34:20.300 --> 02:34:21.600
Like I said brain issue here.


3073
02:34:23.200 --> 02:34:25.300
And pituitary makes sense with Pisces being.


3074
02:34:26.600 --> 02:34:27.200
being there


3075
02:34:28.100 --> 02:34:28.400
cool


3076
02:34:29.900 --> 02:34:32.300
That's all I have for you if there are no final questions


3077
02:34:32.300 --> 02:34:34.600
here. That's what I have.


3078
02:34:36.400 --> 02:34:39.100
Once again reading through some energies here.


3079
02:34:39.100 --> 02:34:42.200
It is always easier when your currents have


3080
02:34:42.200 --> 02:34:43.200
questions because


3081
02:34:45.100 --> 02:34:49.100
when someone's asking you a question, you can dive deeper just information.


3082
02:34:48.100 --> 02:34:51.400
Like what we did here is we looked


3083
02:34:51.400 --> 02:34:54.400
into what is there relationships? Like what


3084
02:34:54.400 --> 02:34:57.500
are their romance like was there intimacy? Like then we went to this one was


3085
02:34:57.500 --> 02:34:58.500
their first child like


3086
02:34:59.600 --> 02:35:02.700
this is a lot of information. We didn't dive deep enough apparently, but


3087
02:35:02.700 --> 02:35:05.300
we also were looking at the lens here and


3088
02:35:05.300 --> 02:35:08.300
the lenses can get mixed up. That's what happened here. We looked at the career here.


3089
02:35:08.300 --> 02:35:11.700
The problem is you're looking at such a generalized thing


3090
02:35:11.700 --> 02:35:14.300
that you can't really tie it together


3091
02:35:14.300 --> 02:35:17.300
because you're so abstract when you ask questions and what I


3092
02:35:17.300 --> 02:35:20.300
should have done is asked, you know his relationship with it how that


3093
02:35:20.300 --> 02:35:23.400
child came about what's that child doing? Those are the real questions


3094
02:35:23.400 --> 02:35:26.300
that you ask when you're just saying like, what's the first child's energy?


3095
02:35:27.200 --> 02:35:27.900
It's a lot.


3096
02:35:28.800 --> 02:35:31.200
And you want to narrow it down. So when you're asking when you're


3097
02:35:31.200 --> 02:35:34.900
looking at your own chart narrow it down ask yourself questions. Will


3098
02:35:34.900 --> 02:35:37.700
this happen? Will that happen asking that


3099
02:35:37.700 --> 02:35:40.900
what determines cheating Eighth House and Neptune? So


3100
02:35:40.900 --> 02:35:43.500
Pluto and Neptune can both represent cheating.


3101
02:35:44.300 --> 02:35:47.400
The Eighth House can be things that are manipulative secretive and


3102
02:35:47.400 --> 02:35:47.600
hidden.


3103
02:35:48.400 --> 02:35:50.000
and also controlling


3104
02:35:50.800 --> 02:35:53.300
which bring the secret aspect is usually


3105
02:35:53.300 --> 02:35:56.700
what brings in and Pluto and itself involves sex


3106
02:35:56.700 --> 02:35:59.400
the act of it.


3107
02:36:00.500 --> 02:36:03.600
And then Neptune is usually lies to


3108
02:36:03.600 --> 02:36:06.800
see things that are hidden whatnot. So when you see those two there and


3109
02:36:06.800 --> 02:36:09.400
then because you're talking about Pluto and Neptune 12th house


3110
02:36:09.400 --> 02:36:11.900
ruler. Sometimes Eighth House ruler often.


3111
02:36:12.800 --> 02:36:15.300
And in this case you see the Eighth House ruler.


3112
02:36:16.800 --> 02:36:19.300
Is conjunct or is in the


3113
02:36:19.300 --> 02:36:23.100
same house? Anyway Mars and


3114
02:36:22.100 --> 02:36:26.000
Mars has to do with sex passion action


3115
02:36:25.900 --> 02:36:28.400
and that has Chiron. So


3116
02:36:28.400 --> 02:36:31.300
you kind of Link these together and that actually makes a


3117
02:36:31.300 --> 02:36:31.600
lot of sense.


3118
02:36:37.500 --> 02:36:40.400
Aquarius is also friendship. So this person would


3119
02:36:40.400 --> 02:36:41.900
have been somebody who was a friend.


3120
02:36:42.900 --> 02:36:45.600
It's also in the house of friendships and then


3121
02:36:45.600 --> 02:36:49.200
that's here. So somebody who his partnered maybe


3122
02:36:48.200 --> 02:36:50.100
knew but didn't really know.


3123
02:36:57.200 --> 02:37:00.800
Not just in this sharpen General. Yeah, I've Aries


3124
02:37:00.800 --> 02:37:03.400
ruling the Eighth House. You mentioned his Mars.


3125
02:37:04.100 --> 02:37:07.300
And you mentioned his Marsh next is 8th house ruler could be cheating and


3126
02:37:07.300 --> 02:37:08.000
triggered my question.


3127
02:37:09.100 --> 02:37:11.600
Yeah, well yeah, it's not just


3128
02:37:13.700 --> 02:37:16.100
Aries ruling Eighth House. Yes, so it would have to


3129
02:37:16.100 --> 02:37:16.200
be


3130
02:37:18.700 --> 02:37:21.500
for cheating and you have to relate it


3131
02:37:21.500 --> 02:37:24.700
to the first house you have to dive deep into that. But you have to be that the


3132
02:37:24.700 --> 02:37:27.700
Eighth House ruler would be.


3133
02:37:29.400 --> 02:37:32.500
Either in the fifth house in the seventh house conjunct Venus


3134
02:37:32.500 --> 02:37:32.800
like this.


3135
02:37:34.300 --> 02:37:36.900
There's a lot of ways that cheating can play out.


3136
02:37:38.200 --> 02:37:39.400
and that's the thing too is like


3137
02:37:41.600 --> 02:37:42.400
I don't explain this.


3138
02:37:43.400 --> 02:37:46.400
Everything has motivation. So things play out the same


3139
02:37:46.400 --> 02:37:48.700
in generalized context.


3140
02:37:49.800 --> 02:37:52.300
Throughout most charts but always for


3141
02:37:52.300 --> 02:37:56.000
a different reason so it's like we all have friends and sometimes


3142
02:37:55.300 --> 02:37:58.700
we all like to hang out with friends. But if


3143
02:37:58.700 --> 02:38:01.400
you have like Scorpio, it's like deep bonds with few friends.


3144
02:38:01.400 --> 02:38:04.200
If you have Mars, it's like maybe you're the person


3145
02:38:04.200 --> 02:38:07.600
likes to go out and you you make friends or you


3146
02:38:07.600 --> 02:38:10.600
like to go out and do things with friends if it's like Neptune, there's


3147
02:38:10.600 --> 02:38:13.400
like maybe your friends are kind of few and far between maybe you


3148
02:38:13.400 --> 02:38:16.500
don't see them too often. Maybe these are drinking buddies. Like it


3149
02:38:16.500 --> 02:38:19.200
really depends on how this place out and some people can


3150
02:38:19.200 --> 02:38:22.400
be very similar with how their friendships are but there's that one


3151
02:38:22.400 --> 02:38:25.200
energy. That's a little bit different which is off you


3152
02:38:25.200 --> 02:38:28.600
can obviously make mistakes when you're reading you can obviously read too


3153
02:38:28.600 --> 02:38:31.500
far into something what I don't think you can read too far because it dwindles


3154
02:38:31.500 --> 02:38:33.100
it down narrows it down. I should say


3155
02:38:36.700 --> 02:38:39.300
but it's like so if you're looking for Cheating in


3156
02:38:39.300 --> 02:38:39.900
a chart, it's like


3157
02:38:40.700 --> 02:38:42.100
and you got to be careful too because


3158
02:38:43.500 --> 02:38:46.300
you have to look at every aspect so something that might look like cheating


3159
02:38:46.300 --> 02:38:49.500
at first you have to go back like for instance here with the


3160
02:38:49.500 --> 02:38:52.200
first a child and potentially seeing a loss when you go back


3161
02:38:52.200 --> 02:38:56.700
and what I missed was Venus being


3162
02:38:55.700 --> 02:38:58.300
the chart ruler and


3163
02:38:58.300 --> 02:39:01.300
trying the chart ruler which means that child is not


3164
02:39:01.300 --> 02:39:04.800
gone that's life that is action. There's


3165
02:39:04.800 --> 02:39:07.500
a connection and that connection is not gone. There's


3166
02:39:07.500 --> 02:39:08.800
no Pluto involved in this


3167
02:39:10.100 --> 02:39:13.300
Pluto's up here four degrees. There's an inconjunction but that's


3168
02:39:13.300 --> 02:39:16.400
up in the 12th house here. There's definitely an it. There's


3169
02:39:16.400 --> 02:39:19.600
definitely a because there's a connection there. There's definitely


3170
02:39:19.600 --> 02:39:20.900
a wound here and there's definitely a


3171
02:39:25.300 --> 02:39:28.300
having children versus the relationship with this child


3172
02:39:28.300 --> 02:39:31.100
like you have to read all this together, but basically there would be


3173
02:39:31.100 --> 02:39:31.400
a


3174
02:39:32.500 --> 02:39:35.500
mending with the north note here. There'll be amending with


3175
02:39:35.500 --> 02:39:38.900
the bond with this children and there would not be a


3176
02:39:38.900 --> 02:39:41.700
deep bond with this child here on a


3177
02:39:41.700 --> 02:39:44.500
daily basis. So this person this child was removed from his


3178
02:39:44.500 --> 02:39:47.100
life. And if he wanted to have a deep bond with


3179
02:39:47.100 --> 02:39:50.900
this child, he would have to find a


3180
02:39:50.900 --> 02:39:53.200
creative way to do it because it wouldn't be by having a


3181
02:39:53.200 --> 02:39:54.300
partnership with that person.


3182
02:39:56.900 --> 02:39:57.800
Virgo here


3183
02:39:59.300 --> 02:40:01.700
could be through work could be through Outreach could be through.


3184
02:40:04.500 --> 02:40:06.200
Could be through networking could be through.


3185
02:40:09.600 --> 02:40:13.100
Could be through their job could be literally what


3186
02:40:12.100 --> 02:40:15.800
they've learned through because it's you know Mercury what


3187
02:40:15.800 --> 02:40:19.400
they learned through their job could allow this


3188
02:40:18.400 --> 02:40:21.200
bonding to happen. So it could


3189
02:40:21.200 --> 02:40:24.000
be that I mean, I've read somewhere that it may have been


3190
02:40:24.200 --> 02:40:27.500
when he was 14, but whenever it was that there


3191
02:40:27.500 --> 02:40:27.600
would be


3192
02:40:28.700 --> 02:40:31.400
Growth that would have to happen within him


3193
02:40:31.400 --> 02:40:35.300
which is also this you asked about someone asked about this Pluto and


3194
02:40:35.300 --> 02:40:38.500
retrograde. This is internal work in


3195
02:40:38.500 --> 02:40:41.200
order to make this Bond work this Bond happened with


3196
02:40:41.200 --> 02:40:41.700
that first child.


3197
02:40:43.100 --> 02:40:43.500
18


3198
02:40:46.300 --> 02:40:47.800
that's not an inconjunction. No.


3199
02:40:48.800 --> 02:40:50.500
Right now it is showing one.


3200
02:40:52.400 --> 02:40:55.500
Yeah, so the family this person this child


3201
02:40:55.500 --> 02:40:56.900
does not live with him either.


3202
02:40:58.600 --> 02:41:01.500
Right here. This is an in conjunction. So you know that because the


3203
02:41:01.500 --> 02:41:05.500
fourth is family and home and long-term that.


3204
02:41:06.700 --> 02:41:09.500
The ruler the first child being in conjunct is


3205
02:41:09.500 --> 02:41:12.100
that this that they probably don't even live close to each


3206
02:41:12.100 --> 02:41:12.800
other to be honest.


3207
02:41:22.400 --> 02:41:26.000
Just red Tony and his wife just 2021 had


3208
02:41:25.400 --> 02:41:26.800
their first child.


3209
02:41:28.300 --> 02:41:30.900
With a surrogate and she was a friend. There you go.


3210
02:41:32.200 --> 02:41:35.300
So that's also somehow an inability so that plays


3211
02:41:35.300 --> 02:41:39.300
out in a different way, right? So when you read it, the first one is the


3212
02:41:38.300 --> 02:41:41.300
relationship they created a


3213
02:41:41.300 --> 02:41:44.500
child and that created a problem and then there was a separation now


3214
02:41:44.500 --> 02:41:47.800
if that's accurate that actually makes sense too is that


3215
02:41:49.400 --> 02:41:52.400
Where would that be? That's probably if that's the second.


3216
02:41:53.600 --> 02:41:56.000
Second or third wife second or third


3217
02:41:56.300 --> 02:41:59.300
major relationship with both kind of play out the same way except you'd


3218
02:41:59.300 --> 02:42:02.200
be adding in this information here might even


3219
02:42:02.200 --> 02:42:02.700
be third.


3220
02:42:03.700 --> 02:42:04.200
I don't know.


3221
02:42:05.300 --> 02:42:08.800
How many times he's been married but these two actually share this in


3222
02:42:08.800 --> 02:42:09.100
common?


3223
02:42:10.200 --> 02:42:13.500
The rulers in the sixth house. This one is in conjunct


3224
02:42:13.500 --> 02:42:16.600
Chiron. There's an agitation here. There's the friendship


3225
02:42:16.600 --> 02:42:19.300
and there's the wanting to conceive with the partner here


3226
02:42:19.300 --> 02:42:22.500
so that it's interesting. That's really interesting, but wanting


3227
02:42:22.500 --> 02:42:24.100
to conceive and having a surrogate.


3228
02:42:25.200 --> 02:42:25.700
this is like


3229
02:42:26.500 --> 02:42:29.500
the in conjunction or the semi sextile


3230
02:42:29.500 --> 02:42:30.200
here with health


3231
02:42:31.800 --> 02:42:32.400
That's crazy.


3232
02:42:33.600 --> 02:42:36.500
And you'd have to look at transits like to read I'm seriously to


3233
02:42:36.500 --> 02:42:38.100
dive that deep into it.


3234
02:42:38.900 --> 02:42:41.300
You would really have to dive deep into like


3235
02:42:41.300 --> 02:42:44.400
the transits and the progressions because that's that's how


3236
02:42:44.400 --> 02:42:45.600
you get deeper and like


3237
02:42:46.400 --> 02:42:49.400
You start whittling out the things that don't


3238
02:42:49.400 --> 02:42:52.200
you know that don't make any sense anymore because the


3239
02:42:52.200 --> 02:42:55.400
timing has to like click like this and once it


3240
02:42:55.400 --> 02:42:56.500
clicks it's in.


3241
02:42:57.500 --> 02:42:57.700
but


3242
02:43:01.500 --> 02:43:03.900
Oh, and this was very public apparently because of this.


3243
02:43:06.600 --> 02:43:08.000
Must be the third wife.


3244
02:43:11.100 --> 02:43:13.100
He adopted a daughter first marriage that makes sense.


3245
02:43:35.700 --> 02:43:38.400
So that's the second supposedly his


3246
02:43:38.400 --> 02:43:38.700
second.


3247
02:43:40.300 --> 02:43:42.300
Which is this which makes sense?


3248
02:43:43.200 --> 02:43:43.500
this


3249
02:43:50.100 --> 02:43:51.100
okay.


3250
02:43:55.600 --> 02:43:58.300
Always so thorough as always been great. Oh, thank


3251
02:43:58.300 --> 02:43:58.300
you.


3252
02:44:01.400 --> 02:44:04.100
Is that we got that dot the dollar we saw that.


3253
02:44:05.400 --> 02:44:08.100
Would you look to 10th house and Saturn for


3254
02:44:08.100 --> 02:44:09.700
your relationship with your father?


3255
02:44:11.200 --> 02:44:14.300
And fourth house and moon for mother. So that's such an


3256
02:44:14.300 --> 02:44:14.600
interesting.


3257
02:44:15.600 --> 02:44:18.600
What's interesting is your son the son actually represents your


3258
02:44:18.600 --> 02:44:19.300
father as well?


3259
02:44:21.800 --> 02:44:24.300
Saturn represents Authority the moon


3260
02:44:24.300 --> 02:44:25.800
represents your mother and family


3261
02:44:27.200 --> 02:44:30.300
So it's like the father is actually split into two


3262
02:44:30.300 --> 02:44:31.200
the mother isn't.


3263
02:44:32.500 --> 02:44:35.200
10,000 is usually father fourth house


3264
02:44:35.200 --> 02:44:38.700
is usually mother occasionally. They have been reversed really


3265
02:44:38.700 --> 02:44:41.400
when it comes to the fourth house. It's always family,


3266
02:44:41.400 --> 02:44:43.800
but between the fourth and the tenth who's the authority


3267
02:44:44.600 --> 02:44:47.200
So when you're reading it, it's mother and father


3268
02:44:47.200 --> 02:44:50.500
is so generic and and like


3269
02:44:50.500 --> 02:44:53.200
specific but really what it comes to is who is


3270
02:44:53.200 --> 02:44:56.100
the nurturer in your family who is the


3271
02:44:56.100 --> 02:44:58.200
nurture and who opposed the nurturing?


3272
02:44:59.100 --> 02:45:02.300
Who is the authority who opposed the nurturing that's how you


3273
02:45:02.300 --> 02:45:05.700
actually read it between fourth and 10th. So sometimes the


3274
02:45:05.700 --> 02:45:08.800
10th house is actually the mother the fourth house. I've actually


3275
02:45:08.800 --> 02:45:10.300
seen in my daughter's chart.


3276
02:45:11.100 --> 02:45:13.600
has been very eluding and confusing to me because


3277
02:45:16.400 --> 02:45:20.000
her mother and I are represented in both houses. This is


3278
02:45:19.200 --> 02:45:22.400
very confusing. Sometimes is that her mother


3279
02:45:22.400 --> 02:45:25.900
is the authority most times but I'm also represented in


3280
02:45:25.900 --> 02:45:28.600
her tenth house. I'm trying to determine a


3281
02:45:28.600 --> 02:45:31.900
decipher remember this is my system because I


3282
02:45:31.900 --> 02:45:34.300
feel like there's so much more to astrology. We don't


3283
02:45:34.300 --> 02:45:36.400
know and I feel like what makes it difficult and why?


3284
02:45:37.400 --> 02:45:40.300
You know, you have to really get into it and we can what creates


3285
02:45:40.300 --> 02:45:41.500
a lot of the dissonance.


3286
02:45:42.300 --> 02:45:45.700
Or disconnect with astrology is that astrology was


3287
02:45:45.700 --> 02:45:49.200
around up until the 17th century and then it was removed and when


3288
02:45:48.200 --> 02:45:51.000
it was brought back like a hundred years ago. It was


3289
02:45:51.500 --> 02:45:55.000
pop culture crap newspaper, you know horoscopes and


3290
02:45:54.300 --> 02:45:58.200
no one's gotten back into the actual astrology and


3291
02:45:58.200 --> 02:46:00.300
they're using old stuff that I know doesn't work.


3292
02:46:01.100 --> 02:46:04.000
So I'm trying to like determine what does work and then you get to


3293
02:46:04.300 --> 02:46:07.300
a certain point where you're like I've obsessed with I've obsessed over certain things


3294
02:46:07.300 --> 02:46:10.500
for like seven years and I still can't put together why


3295
02:46:10.500 --> 02:46:13.100
this and this and I know this crap in the textbooks is not


3296
02:46:13.100 --> 02:46:16.100
right. It's it could be partially accurate but it's definitely not


3297
02:46:16.100 --> 02:46:19.400
spot on so I want to know what the truth is and I


3298
02:46:19.400 --> 02:46:22.300
get into like the fourth and 10th. I'm like, how come sometimes I know that it


3299
02:46:22.300 --> 02:46:25.500
rep. The fourth is always family, but it and your roots


3300
02:46:25.500 --> 02:46:28.300
and all that stuff, but sometimes it's not the mother but sometimes it's the


3301
02:46:28.300 --> 02:46:31.700
mother and the father and like there's got to be a reason for


3302
02:46:31.700 --> 02:46:32.500
how it is and


3303
02:46:33.500 --> 02:46:36.400
Right. Now my thinking is just that energy is malleable.


3304
02:46:36.400 --> 02:46:39.700
It's the same reason why I know how to manifest with astrology is


3305
02:46:39.700 --> 02:46:42.100
the same reason why it's not always a hundred percent


3306
02:46:42.100 --> 02:46:44.500
perfect and things play out and I do believe


3307
02:46:45.700 --> 02:46:48.200
that transits and progressions may be


3308
02:46:48.200 --> 02:46:51.600
the the 100% key to


3309
02:46:51.600 --> 02:46:54.500
understanding why the fifth house may


3310
02:46:54.500 --> 02:46:57.400
have only been a certain way when the first child was


3311
02:46:57.400 --> 02:47:00.100
born. It could have I believe in Divine timing and


3312
02:47:00.100 --> 02:47:03.400
I heart I focus very much in on transits.


3313
02:47:03.900 --> 02:47:06.300
So these energies may only play


3314
02:47:06.300 --> 02:47:09.300
out because of the transits and that actually is my


3315
02:47:09.300 --> 02:47:12.500
next evolution of diving deep into the astrology is to


3316
02:47:12.500 --> 02:47:14.700
say okay. Your first child is all these Energies.


3317
02:47:15.800 --> 02:47:17.200
But I can read this three ways.


3318
02:47:18.600 --> 02:47:21.500
So, how do I read it for the time? Your


3319
02:47:21.500 --> 02:47:24.900
first child was born? Well, wherever the transits what


3320
02:47:24.900 --> 02:47:28.600
was going over the fifth house. What was going over the 11th


3321
02:47:27.600 --> 02:47:30.900
house the specifically the ruler to


3322
02:47:30.900 --> 02:47:33.400
know how this played out because that


3323
02:47:33.400 --> 02:47:36.400
could tell me probably will tell me exactly how


3324
02:47:36.400 --> 02:47:39.400
this first child was when the first child was and under


3325
02:47:39.400 --> 02:47:42.600
what circumstances and then also look at the progressions. What


3326
02:47:42.600 --> 02:47:43.900
stage of Life were you in?


3327
02:47:44.700 --> 02:47:45.800
And then pull it all together.


3328
02:47:49.300 --> 02:47:52.800
That hit spot on father was nurturing when mother was the rules


3329
02:47:52.800 --> 02:47:53.300
and regulations.


3330
02:47:54.100 --> 02:47:58.100
Yeah, like I said some people's different. My mother's chart was like that My adoptive


3331
02:47:57.100 --> 02:47:59.900
mother. She hers just flipped.


3332
02:48:00.500 --> 02:48:03.400
Because you look at the the tenth house is not


3333
02:48:03.400 --> 02:48:05.700
just your relationship with your father. It's also their work.


3334
02:48:06.400 --> 02:48:09.900
The fourth house is the relationship with your mother and their work. What


3335
02:48:09.900 --> 02:48:10.500
did they do for a living?


3336
02:48:11.800 --> 02:48:14.700
Also the sun and the moon but with


3337
02:48:14.700 --> 02:48:16.000
my mother that's flipped.


3338
02:48:16.700 --> 02:48:19.600
You know all the my father my grandfather worked


3339
02:48:19.600 --> 02:48:22.400
on cars and that was down here with Gemini and


3340
02:48:22.400 --> 02:48:25.400
Mercury energy. My grandmother was


3341
02:48:25.400 --> 02:48:27.600
a stay-at-home and like there was like


3342
02:48:28.200 --> 02:48:31.400
I think the moon or something up here. It was very obvious that it


3343
02:48:31.400 --> 02:48:31.800
was flipped.


3344
02:48:32.600 --> 02:48:35.600
Figuring out when and why it was flipped really comes


3345
02:48:35.600 --> 02:48:38.200
down to the person's chart you're talking about and sometimes what


3346
02:48:38.200 --> 02:48:41.900
makes it difficult to read other people's charts without them like delivery readings


3347
02:48:41.900 --> 02:48:44.400
or like we're reading a celebrity start right now is I


3348
02:48:44.400 --> 02:48:46.200
don't have that person here to verify anything.


3349
02:48:47.400 --> 02:48:50.100
to say yes or no or to tell me


3350
02:48:50.100 --> 02:48:52.100
their perspective because ultimately


3351
02:48:53.200 --> 02:48:55.900
astrology is perception and perspective.


3352
02:48:56.800 --> 02:48:57.000
and


3353
02:48:58.200 --> 02:49:01.400
the easiest way to explain that is if you have siblings.


3354
02:49:02.500 --> 02:49:05.700
Your fourth and tenth house are different the planets. There


3355
02:49:05.700 --> 02:49:08.100
are different the aspects are different because you don't


3356
02:49:08.100 --> 02:49:11.200
view your mother and you don't view your father the same way that


3357
02:49:11.200 --> 02:49:12.100
your siblings do.


3358
02:49:13.200 --> 02:49:16.600
But you're talking about the same person that person is still


3359
02:49:16.600 --> 02:49:19.500
that person, right? They didn't change it becomes


3360
02:49:19.500 --> 02:49:22.600
someone completely different because you had a sibling right two


3361
02:49:22.600 --> 02:49:25.500
years later. They did evolve they did become,


3362
02:49:25.500 --> 02:49:28.700
you know different and they had different life events


3363
02:49:28.700 --> 02:49:31.200
happen, but it becomes down to it comes


3364
02:49:31.200 --> 02:49:34.600
down to perception your view of your parents is


3365
02:49:34.600 --> 02:49:37.200
not the same as your kids view of your


3366
02:49:37.200 --> 02:49:40.500
parents. What you remember from your childhood that your parents


3367
02:49:40.500 --> 02:49:43.600
did for work might not be the same as your siblings.


3368
02:49:44.600 --> 02:49:46.300
it's very interesting and that's the


3369
02:49:48.400 --> 02:49:51.200
that's the the subjectivity and the


3370
02:49:52.400 --> 02:49:55.300
haziness that can come into astrology that we don't


3371
02:49:55.300 --> 02:49:59.100
talk about a lot. I'll probably do that on my podcast is talk about this because you


3372
02:49:58.100 --> 02:50:01.300
know for me what matters is what's real, but


3373
02:50:01.300 --> 02:50:04.000
what's real can be subjective, which is interesting.


3374
02:50:05.100 --> 02:50:07.300
Would you tell her would you look?


3375
02:50:08.500 --> 02:50:10.600
Already answered your question there. Thank you Taylor.


3376
02:50:11.500 --> 02:50:14.400
Angela again, so we look at them through our


3377
02:50:14.400 --> 02:50:17.400
lens. Boom. Yes. Yes, I


3378
02:50:17.400 --> 02:50:20.200
talk about lenses, but I guess the ultimate that's a good comment


3379
02:50:20.200 --> 02:50:21.200
the ultimate lens.


3380
02:50:22.200 --> 02:50:24.300
Is your lens because it's your perspective?


3381
02:50:25.300 --> 02:50:29.600
It's all relative which is why I believe tropical astrology.


3382
02:50:30.700 --> 02:50:34.200
Is more accurate than some of the other ones that you sidereal placements


3383
02:50:33.200 --> 02:50:36.200
because sidereal placements are the


3384
02:50:36.200 --> 02:50:39.000
real accurate astronomical placements.


3385
02:50:39.800 --> 02:50:42.100
Tropical placements have to do


3386
02:50:42.100 --> 02:50:45.500
with the equator and the point of view in perspective from your position on Earth.


3387
02:50:46.500 --> 02:50:49.100
So that literally in the best way


3388
02:50:49.100 --> 02:50:52.300
to describe that is when you're talking about retrograde planets.


3389
02:50:53.500 --> 02:50:56.600
Planets don't move backwards. They perpetually go


3390
02:50:56.600 --> 02:50:59.500
in orbit in the same direction. So a retrograde


3391
02:50:59.500 --> 02:51:02.200
is the visualization based off


3392
02:51:02.200 --> 02:51:05.300
of the ecliptic when we pass by in a


3393
02:51:05.300 --> 02:51:08.500
certain point in orbit that makes the planet look like it's going backwards,


3394
02:51:08.500 --> 02:51:12.500
but the fun part of it is we feel that change


3395
02:51:11.500 --> 02:51:14.500
in energy why the planet


3396
02:51:14.500 --> 02:51:17.600
still moving forward but it's the perspective and


3397
02:51:17.600 --> 02:51:20.800
relationship from Earth to that planet that allows


3398
02:51:20.800 --> 02:51:23.700
us to to for Mercury to do what Mercury


3399
02:51:23.700 --> 02:51:26.900
does for things to turn inward for things to work backwards so


3400
02:51:26.900 --> 02:51:27.400
to speak


3401
02:51:28.300 --> 02:51:31.900
So it why would the real placements matter when the


3402
02:51:31.900 --> 02:51:34.900
placements in relation to the Earth are really


3403
02:51:34.900 --> 02:51:37.200
what we should be paying attention to? That's why I believe this but yes,


3404
02:51:37.200 --> 02:51:40.300
it's all perspective. So, it's your lens. How do you


3405
02:51:40.300 --> 02:51:43.300
view things? How do you push things which is also why when


3406
02:51:43.300 --> 02:51:46.300
people ask me their life purpose and I'm looking at their sun sign and


3407
02:51:46.300 --> 02:51:46.800
their Sun placement.


3408
02:51:47.700 --> 02:51:50.100
It's like what really makes you happy.


3409
02:51:51.400 --> 02:51:54.400
Tony Robbins clearly working in


3410
02:51:54.400 --> 02:51:57.400
a spiritual sense in with compassion makes him


3411
02:51:57.400 --> 02:51:57.700
happy.


3412
02:51:58.800 --> 02:52:01.900
You know having routine without routine


3413
02:52:01.900 --> 02:52:04.400
having where's my where's Neptune for him


3414
02:52:04.400 --> 02:52:07.700
in the second house making money off of being compassionate


3415
02:52:07.700 --> 02:52:10.300
on a very deep psychological level using


3416
02:52:10.300 --> 02:52:11.700
psychology within this.


3417
02:52:12.600 --> 02:52:16.600
I do know that's accurate, you know communication within


3418
02:52:15.600 --> 02:52:18.700
his career being animated


3419
02:52:18.700 --> 02:52:22.600
and and having life and and speaking to


3420
02:52:22.600 --> 02:52:25.100
groups even online but groups and


3421
02:52:25.100 --> 02:52:27.100
communities and especially going to like


3422
02:52:28.600 --> 02:52:32.100
Jupiter Deccan teaching coaching online coaching


3423
02:52:31.100 --> 02:52:34.600
through communication maybe


3424
02:52:34.600 --> 02:52:37.000
even going to colleges. I don't know exactly what he does.


3425
02:52:37.100 --> 02:52:40.900
But I imagine he went to colleges at some point because it's not only the Jupiter


3426
02:52:40.900 --> 02:52:43.300
decade but it's the roar if it's ninth house that's here. So I'd


3427
02:52:43.300 --> 02:52:46.700
imagine he goes to universities quite a bit and travels


3428
02:52:46.700 --> 02:52:49.800
for work and that's all extremely important for him. That's


3429
02:52:49.800 --> 02:52:52.700
what makes him happy. So what makes you happy what's


3430
02:52:52.700 --> 02:52:55.300
all connected to your son? And it's a


3431
02:52:55.300 --> 02:52:58.600
really tough question and when you relocate what's connected


3432
02:52:58.600 --> 02:53:01.800
to your new son, what makes you happy in that area. Where are


3433
02:53:01.800 --> 02:53:02.500
you supposed to shine there?


3434
02:53:03.400 --> 02:53:06.700
That'll be my relocation class a little bit tomorrow.


3435
02:53:08.500 --> 02:53:11.100
Ashley when do you know it's time to


3436
02:53:11.100 --> 02:53:12.000
look at progressions?


3437
02:53:13.100 --> 02:53:16.700
I always glance at progressions, but when I'm looking at I got


3438
02:53:16.700 --> 02:53:19.700
to finish your question, but when I glance at progressions, I


3439
02:53:19.700 --> 02:53:20.700
am looking at.


3440
02:53:21.700 --> 02:53:24.600
For instance. I'm going to pull up my chart here. So I'm


3441
02:53:24.600 --> 02:53:28.200
not using some random persons information that


3442
02:53:27.200 --> 02:53:29.100
I can't verify.


3443
02:53:31.200 --> 02:53:31.900
mmm


3444
02:53:33.900 --> 02:53:36.100
You know the other thing when you start reading charts, it's like


3445
02:53:36.100 --> 02:53:39.300
you can be very accurate, but you're always learning. That's the fun thing.


3446
02:53:39.300 --> 02:53:41.200
So this is my progressed chart.


3447
02:53:41.900 --> 02:53:44.400
I guess it would help for context for you to see my natal


3448
02:53:44.400 --> 02:53:44.700
chart as well.


3449
02:53:47.900 --> 02:53:50.400
Here's my natal chart. I'm a Leo Rising. I've emit


3450
02:53:50.400 --> 02:53:53.300
heaven and Taurus. I have a moon and Aquarius in the seventh


3451
02:53:53.300 --> 02:53:56.300
house the moon moves a lot. By the way. My moon


3452
02:53:56.300 --> 02:53:59.900
is in Virgo attention to details fearing that


3453
02:53:59.900 --> 02:54:02.300
I won't have attention to details. What am


3454
02:54:02.300 --> 02:54:05.400
I going to do for work? That's always something. How am I going to be of


3455
02:54:05.400 --> 02:54:08.600
service? Always there very critical


3456
02:54:08.600 --> 02:54:11.300
of myself lately. This is gonna be two to


3457
02:54:11.300 --> 02:54:14.800
two and a half years until it gets into my second house. And this could be a lot of focus on relationships


3458
02:54:14.800 --> 02:54:17.200
values career making a lot


3459
02:54:17.200 --> 02:54:20.000
of money so I know the next two and a half years is interesting.


3460
02:54:21.800 --> 02:54:24.900
Um, but my son is at zero degrees so


3461
02:54:24.900 --> 02:54:27.100
I know and I know that mercury pretty soon


3462
02:54:27.100 --> 02:54:30.600
is at 27. So it's going to come here. So my thought patterns


3463
02:54:30.600 --> 02:54:33.200
how I think it becomes my progressed ruler of


3464
02:54:33.200 --> 02:54:36.600
my first house. So my influence is going to be very much pushed back


3465
02:54:36.600 --> 02:54:41.200
into filming creativity storytelling


3466
02:54:39.200 --> 02:54:43.000
music and entertainment all


3467
02:54:42.200 --> 02:54:45.100
that kind of stuff here children, which is


3468
02:54:45.100 --> 02:54:48.700
interesting because I've recently had a


3469
02:54:48.700 --> 02:54:51.400
flip over into being like I want to write children's


3470
02:54:51.400 --> 02:54:54.300
content and I'm not ready. Like I feel like I want to but


3471
02:54:54.300 --> 02:54:57.900
I'm not quite ready and that's because Mercury's influence


3472
02:54:57.900 --> 02:55:01.100
with the orb of influence is flipping in here, but I'm


3473
02:55:00.100 --> 02:55:03.300
not quite there's the North Node


3474
02:55:03.300 --> 02:55:05.200
here. I'm not comfortable doing it.


3475
02:55:06.100 --> 02:55:09.300
Which is interesting that this is here too because my partner and


3476
02:55:09.300 --> 02:55:12.900
I going to be doing it Ashley and I are going to be writing children's content and


3477
02:55:12.900 --> 02:55:15.100
we're basing it. I didn't even


3478
02:55:15.100 --> 02:55:18.400
look at this. Swear to God. We're basing it on our family like we


3479
02:55:18.400 --> 02:55:19.600
came up with seven different.


3480
02:55:21.900 --> 02:55:25.300
Six or seven something like that different IPS like


3481
02:55:24.300 --> 02:55:27.700
franchises or whatever series I


3482
02:55:27.700 --> 02:55:30.600
should say that are all based on our our family based


3483
02:55:30.600 --> 02:55:33.100
on our dog based on our children based on all of that


3484
02:55:33.100 --> 02:55:36.300
stuff. That's kind of interesting, but I haven't


3485
02:55:36.900 --> 02:55:39.800
Had the desire to actually write it yet, and I


3486
02:55:39.800 --> 02:55:42.100
need to do it. But I have a feeling I actually


3487
02:55:42.100 --> 02:55:44.200
know that that's not going to be long.


3488
02:55:50.400 --> 02:55:51.100
So at the end of the year.


3489
02:55:57.300 --> 02:56:00.300
So it could happen before then, but the beginning


3490
02:56:00.300 --> 02:56:03.700
of next year end of this year beginning of next year 29 degrees.


3491
02:56:03.700 --> 02:56:06.100
It's gonna flip over and that's what I'm going


3492
02:56:06.100 --> 02:56:06.500
to want to do.


3493
02:56:07.300 --> 02:56:10.400
So I look at progressions when I'm looking for changes when


3494
02:56:10.400 --> 02:56:11.000
I'm looking to see.


3495
02:56:13.300 --> 02:56:16.200
You know where things are. I know that in this stage of my life.


3496
02:56:17.200 --> 02:56:20.400
I have to add the fact that my midheaven the things


3497
02:56:20.400 --> 02:56:23.300
that I want to do are Gemini related and that


3498
02:56:23.300 --> 02:56:26.300
mercury is here. So my career is actually going


3499
02:56:26.300 --> 02:56:29.700
to be writing children's books doing entertainment and


3500
02:56:29.700 --> 02:56:32.200
stuff like that. I'm actually moving back into that. Now that my son's


3501
02:56:32.200 --> 02:56:35.200
there we're consequently. We're about to move back to Los Angeles.


3502
02:56:35.200 --> 02:56:36.900
So this all makes sense.


3503
02:56:38.400 --> 02:56:39.100
When you tie it all together.


3504
02:56:40.300 --> 02:56:42.900
The sun is trying.


3505
02:56:44.300 --> 02:56:47.100
Uranus here in Sagittarius in the


3506
02:56:47.100 --> 02:56:50.800
fourth house, which is literally feeling like I want to move there


3507
02:56:50.800 --> 02:56:53.100
needs to be an agitation. There was a little bit ago that


3508
02:56:53.100 --> 02:56:54.100
actually created that


3509
02:56:54.900 --> 02:56:58.000
And then this here know where


3510
02:56:57.100 --> 02:57:01.100
we're going to live is actually the community where


3511
02:57:00.100 --> 02:57:04.100
we're gonna feel safe and and we figured


3512
02:57:03.100 --> 02:57:07.300
this out but I traveled it's crazy.


3513
02:57:06.300 --> 02:57:09.700
I actually traveled two weeks


3514
02:57:09.700 --> 02:57:12.000
ago something like that to LA to figure this out.


3515
02:57:12.800 --> 02:57:15.800
So it's it's really interesting and


3516
02:57:15.800 --> 02:57:18.100
I think it's also interesting that my second


3517
02:57:18.100 --> 02:57:21.900
child here. My progressions is here and we're actually thinking about


3518
02:57:21.900 --> 02:57:24.500
doing it to have our second child in La as


3519
02:57:24.500 --> 02:57:25.800
opposed to having a here in Florida.


3520
02:57:27.300 --> 02:57:31.100
But I know that the beginning of next year is going to be huge because


3521
02:57:30.100 --> 02:57:33.000
Mercury is going to


3522
02:57:33.700 --> 02:57:35.500
be in the 12th house. It can be conjunct the Sun.


3523
02:57:36.800 --> 02:57:39.100
And I forgot to look so let me just look. Let me just


3524
02:57:39.100 --> 02:57:39.500
change this.


3525
02:57:41.400 --> 02:57:44.900
And my Moon's gonna be at 19. So just before this my


3526
02:57:44.900 --> 02:57:47.300
Moon's gonna be over my ascendant and then it's


3527
02:57:47.300 --> 02:57:50.400
ruler is gonna be here. So by this time next


3528
02:57:50.400 --> 02:57:54.100
year, I will be likely changing careers because


3529
02:57:53.100 --> 02:57:57.500
all of this here this trying to Uranus. I


3530
02:57:56.500 --> 02:57:59.500
already know this is happening then that's


3531
02:57:59.500 --> 02:58:02.700
because of the orb of influence. I'm feeling this impact already.


3532
02:58:04.100 --> 02:58:07.000
So the square here, it's a whole


3533
02:58:07.300 --> 02:58:10.300
thing. But you you look at progressions all the


3534
02:58:10.300 --> 02:58:12.100
time more importantly.


3535
02:58:13.100 --> 02:58:14.800
When you look at somebody's ascendant.


3536
02:58:16.100 --> 02:58:19.400
And I'm I'll end it on this because I don't think they'll be more questions. But


3537
02:58:19.400 --> 02:58:22.300
when you're looking at somebody's ascendant one of


3538
02:58:22.300 --> 02:58:25.200
the biggest reasons that I've noticed why people can't figure out


3539
02:58:25.200 --> 02:58:29.000
no matter how much you prove to them why placidus


3540
02:58:28.200 --> 02:58:31.300
versus whole science is this huge thing is because of


3541
02:58:31.300 --> 02:58:35.500
progressions if you take somebody who is and


3542
02:58:34.500 --> 02:58:37.500
I'm not going to use me. I'm gonna use my wife.


3543
02:58:39.600 --> 02:58:41.400
So if I use Ashley?


3544
02:58:43.000 --> 02:58:43.200
here


3545
02:58:44.600 --> 02:58:46.100
she has a 29.


3546
02:58:46.700 --> 02:58:49.200
And this was birth time rectified right?


3547
02:58:49.200 --> 02:58:52.800
She had a birth certificate the birth certificate had the wrong time. We


3548
02:58:52.800 --> 02:58:56.100
rectified it to be 15-ish minutes earlier, and


3549
02:58:55.100 --> 02:58:57.900
I'm going to know


3550
02:58:59.400 --> 02:59:02.400
this year because she'll have a progressed


3551
02:59:02.400 --> 02:59:05.600
Ascendant flip when that happens. I'll


3552
02:59:05.600 --> 02:59:08.900
be able to hone this degree in even further,


3553
02:59:08.900 --> 02:59:11.000
but it's within 27 to 29, but


3554
02:59:11.900 --> 02:59:15.200
29 degrees that means almost immediately


3555
02:59:14.200 --> 02:59:16.000
after birth


3556
02:59:16.600 --> 02:59:18.900
She flipped into a Virgo Rising.


3557
02:59:20.300 --> 02:59:23.900
that could be really difficult because if you feel like in placidus


3558
02:59:23.900 --> 02:59:24.500
that


3559
02:59:25.600 --> 02:59:28.400
Most of her first house would be Virgo. So she's


3560
02:59:28.400 --> 02:59:31.500
always felt like a Virgo. She has Leo traits,


3561
02:59:31.500 --> 02:59:32.700
but she's always felt like a Virgo.


3562
02:59:33.500 --> 02:59:34.400
and that is because


3563
02:59:35.500 --> 02:59:38.200
her progressions like before she was even


3564
02:59:38.200 --> 02:59:40.100
a year old. She would have been a Virgo Rising.


3565
02:59:40.900 --> 02:59:43.700
So it can be very hard to rectify placidus versus


3566
02:59:43.700 --> 02:59:46.300
whole science because of that, but I also need to


3567
02:59:46.300 --> 02:59:46.400
know.


3568
02:59:47.300 --> 02:59:50.700
how did that change her midheaven because her natal midheaven is in Taurus


3569
02:59:50.700 --> 02:59:51.700
and if I


3570
02:59:55.100 --> 02:59:57.800
If I pull up her progressions.


3571
02:59:59.400 --> 03:00:00.200
at 9


3572
03:00:01.300 --> 03:00:04.500
or I don't even know. How old should be. Let's just here. Let's


3573
03:00:04.500 --> 03:00:07.400
choose 10 just 19 1995.


3574
03:00:08.200 --> 03:00:08.700
She's 10.


3575
03:00:10.400 --> 03:00:13.400
So her progressions when she was 10 still a Virgo


3576
03:00:13.400 --> 03:00:16.600
Rising midheaven already Chiron.


3577
03:00:17.400 --> 03:00:20.400
Not that matters, but she would have public mmm in terms


3578
03:00:20.400 --> 03:00:23.300
of career wouldn't matter too much. But this means in her


3579
03:00:23.300 --> 03:00:26.100
life, there would be situations. I actually do know that


3580
03:00:26.100 --> 03:00:29.600
that her public education Gemini mid


3581
03:00:29.600 --> 03:00:32.200
have in tenth house that there's a very public incident.


3582
03:00:34.300 --> 03:00:37.900
Involving the school where she


3583
03:00:37.900 --> 03:00:40.600
ended up actually having to change schools. So


3584
03:00:40.600 --> 03:00:43.600
this right here I know is very accurate because


3585
03:00:43.600 --> 03:00:44.700
of this conjunction here.


3586
03:00:47.900 --> 03:00:50.300
And I need to know as she gets older


3587
03:00:50.300 --> 03:00:53.700
your midheaven also moves as your ascendant moves you change


3588
03:00:53.700 --> 03:00:56.300
jobs you change Focus people who stick with


3589
03:00:56.300 --> 03:00:59.400
one job their entire life tend not to be happy. Why because you


3590
03:00:59.400 --> 03:01:02.400
evolve you change and while your mid Heaven


3591
03:01:02.400 --> 03:01:05.400
always stays the same in your natal chart. It doesn't in your


3592
03:01:05.400 --> 03:01:08.200
progress chart. So you would always want to check your progress chart to


3593
03:01:08.200 --> 03:01:11.500
see what stage are you in your life? Technically. She should


3594
03:01:11.500 --> 03:01:12.700
be communicating in writing.


3595
03:01:13.700 --> 03:01:16.100
Even even now probably if I go


3596
03:01:16.100 --> 03:01:19.100
to her I know that this is tying it all together.


3597
03:01:19.100 --> 03:01:23.000
Not really today's purpose. But if I go to today's date


3598
03:01:22.600 --> 03:01:24.600
for her progressions,


3599
03:01:25.700 --> 03:01:28.200
her midheaven is at 29 degrees


3600
03:01:28.200 --> 03:01:28.500
now.


3601
03:01:29.800 --> 03:01:32.200
You would think that hermit Heaven's


3602
03:01:32.200 --> 03:01:36.200
gonna go into cancer next and it might but her


3603
03:01:35.200 --> 03:01:38.200
sentence at 29, which means she's about to have


3604
03:01:38.200 --> 03:01:39.400
an ascendant flip.


3605
03:01:40.300 --> 03:01:42.000
So I know that if I fast forward this.


3606
03:01:42.900 --> 03:01:43.900
Not even two months.


3607
03:01:45.300 --> 03:01:49.700
That she's going to be a Libra rising progressed and


3608
03:01:49.700 --> 03:01:53.500
actually does put her mid Heaven at zero degrees cancer. So


3609
03:01:52.500 --> 03:01:55.400
that will continue to progress forward which


3610
03:01:55.400 --> 03:01:59.200
means she and her partner her and


3611
03:01:58.200 --> 03:02:00.200
I together are going to be


3612
03:02:02.400 --> 03:02:06.100
Doing something very public very soon regarding her


3613
03:02:05.100 --> 03:02:06.500
career.


3614
03:02:07.200 --> 03:02:10.500
Something potentially nurturing but more so


3615
03:02:10.500 --> 03:02:13.500
our own business which makes sense. This actually


3616
03:02:13.500 --> 03:02:16.700
makes a lot of sense because we're about to launch the Mystic


3617
03:02:16.700 --> 03:02:18.400
Rebels platform. I got the okay today.


3618
03:02:19.900 --> 03:02:23.300
I didn't get a response for the last thing I asked but


3619
03:02:22.300 --> 03:02:24.800
literally


3620
03:02:27.100 --> 03:02:30.200
the last thing they said was we're going to launch by the


3621
03:02:30.200 --> 03:02:31.500
end of this month all done.


3622
03:02:32.300 --> 03:02:36.000
So it is March right now. So between in


3623
03:02:35.100 --> 03:02:38.400
the next 30 days, it'll be up. We'll probably


3624
03:02:38.400 --> 03:02:41.200
doing a beta and then we're gonna do a full but that's probably


3625
03:02:41.200 --> 03:02:44.200
what this is to be honest with you and all of this


3626
03:02:44.200 --> 03:02:47.700
energy here is opposing all the seventh house


3627
03:02:47.700 --> 03:02:50.500
energy of pioneering and doing stuff


3628
03:02:50.500 --> 03:02:52.100
that's involving entertainment and internet.


3629
03:02:53.400 --> 03:02:56.500
And this is fun. This is fun for me because it verifies.


3630
03:02:57.700 --> 03:02:59.900
If validates that's the better word.


3631
03:03:01.200 --> 03:03:04.600
That the platform we're launching is going to launch because


3632
03:03:04.600 --> 03:03:08.500
as an entrepreneur you always have that insecurity is


3633
03:03:08.500 --> 03:03:12.000
it and she's gonna have that insecurity here. It


3634
03:03:11.100 --> 03:03:14.000
might not expand as quickly as we want.


3635
03:03:14.900 --> 03:03:16.100
You know chirons there.


3636
03:03:16.700 --> 03:03:19.600
However, it's healing and


3637
03:03:19.600 --> 03:03:22.600
if we just focus on the fact that it is communication healing


3638
03:03:22.600 --> 03:03:25.000
and whatnot. Then it is you know


3639
03:03:25.400 --> 03:03:26.300
publishing for it may be difficult.


3640
03:03:27.100 --> 03:03:29.300
And we have to know that we have to understand that.


3641
03:03:30.400 --> 03:03:33.400
Getting ad space and people caring through ad space might


3642
03:03:33.400 --> 03:03:36.400
be a challenge. I have to look at mine. I also have to look at the Mystic Rebels


3643
03:03:36.400 --> 03:03:36.800
business.


3644
03:03:37.800 --> 03:03:40.200
That's where it's fun. That's where it's exciting for me because I


3645
03:03:40.200 --> 03:03:43.100
could look at all at her chart. I can look at my chart and I can


3646
03:03:43.100 --> 03:03:44.500
look at the business chart.


3647
03:03:45.400 --> 03:03:48.500
And I could see that her trying to do ads for


3648
03:03:48.500 --> 03:03:51.300
it might not promote it to watch she would actually have


3649
03:03:51.300 --> 03:03:54.900
to communicate live if


3650
03:03:54.900 --> 03:03:57.200
she talks about it live. It'll do


3651
03:03:57.200 --> 03:04:00.200
very well as a Healer. She's healing she's doing her job doing it live.


3652
03:04:00.200 --> 03:04:02.500
It'll do well same thing for me.


3653
03:04:03.300 --> 03:04:06.400
We both have to do it. I can see that in her energy and


3654
03:04:06.400 --> 03:04:06.700
her chart.


3655
03:04:07.900 --> 03:04:11.000
And that any sort of promotion is going to be through entertainment


3656
03:04:10.900 --> 03:04:13.300
through doing it online through doing


3657
03:04:13.300 --> 03:04:14.000
it in a group.


3658
03:04:14.900 --> 03:04:17.600
So I know that the publishing of it that's how


3659
03:04:17.600 --> 03:04:20.000
it works. Right? So this is why you look at progressions.


3660
03:04:20.800 --> 03:04:23.300
Because your natal chart is a static thing. It is


3661
03:04:23.300 --> 03:04:26.600
you it's your energies, but it's not the energies


3662
03:04:26.600 --> 03:04:29.300
of you now. It's the energy of energies of you always


3663
03:04:29.300 --> 03:04:32.300
but doesn't count for the fact that you've gained


3664
03:04:32.300 --> 03:04:35.800
wisdom that you've gone through things and then you add transits to


3665
03:04:35.800 --> 03:04:35.800
it.


3666
03:04:36.700 --> 03:04:40.200
And you can see why I get frustrated with tiktok


3667
03:04:39.200 --> 03:04:42.400
astrologers who say if you're if you're


3668
03:04:42.400 --> 03:04:45.300
a earth sign prepare for your life to suck.


3669
03:04:47.100 --> 03:04:50.400
You know, it's really frustrating and there's a lot to it and to


3670
03:04:50.400 --> 03:04:53.300
to be a good reader you want to take into account as much as you can


3671
03:04:53.300 --> 03:04:53.500
here.


3672
03:04:56.200 --> 03:04:58.800
This is interesting this this energy here.


3673
03:05:00.100 --> 03:05:03.200
Ashley right now has not felt that she is.


3674
03:05:06.300 --> 03:05:09.500
I don't want to put her stuff out there, but she's felt that you know,


3675
03:05:09.500 --> 03:05:12.400
she knows that this is her calling but she's had


3676
03:05:12.400 --> 03:05:13.500
an interesting go of.


3677
03:05:14.700 --> 03:05:17.900
Deciding whether or not this is like something that she


3678
03:05:17.900 --> 03:05:20.400
wants to be known for what not. Anyway, I see


3679
03:05:20.400 --> 03:05:20.600
this.


3680
03:05:21.800 --> 03:05:22.000
this


3681
03:05:23.300 --> 03:05:25.400
Chiron Neptune the spiritual


3682
03:05:26.900 --> 03:05:29.200
Career the spiritual career not knowing if


3683
03:05:29.200 --> 03:05:32.800
this is really what she wants to do and that she's helping


3684
03:05:32.800 --> 03:05:35.300
other people enough which is crazy because


3685
03:05:35.300 --> 03:05:38.300
she's an amazing Terror reader amazing with herbalism and whatnot,


3686
03:05:38.300 --> 03:05:40.000
but I see why.


3687
03:05:41.400 --> 03:05:44.200
That's the whole thing. If someone's in her 2030s looking for


3688
03:05:44.200 --> 03:05:48.300
their career, would you look at the progression start chart two usually, yeah,


3689
03:05:47.300 --> 03:05:51.000
I usually pull it up for me.


3690
03:05:52.200 --> 03:05:55.500
I look at their natal energy. I always ask. Do you


3691
03:05:55.500 --> 03:05:58.100
live there now, right. If you were born in Santa Rosa like this


3692
03:05:58.100 --> 03:06:01.100
chart. Do you live in Santa Rosa? Do you live in California? Do you


3693
03:06:01.100 --> 03:06:03.500
live in the general vicinity if the answer is no


3694
03:06:04.300 --> 03:06:08.000
I need to know your relocation chart. I have a guy a regular


3695
03:06:07.400 --> 03:06:11.000
client talk to him every couple weeks do his


3696
03:06:10.300 --> 03:06:12.800
chart readings because he's got a lot going on.


3697
03:06:14.200 --> 03:06:15.400
And he was born in Africa.


3698
03:06:16.400 --> 03:06:20.300
Has moved to Florida has moved to Texas and


3699
03:06:20.300 --> 03:06:23.000
a few other states moved around the world a couple times.


3700
03:06:24.700 --> 03:06:27.300
And now he's considering another move and I had to break


3701
03:06:27.300 --> 03:06:30.500
it down had to talk to him about his again his Moon


3702
03:06:30.500 --> 03:06:33.300
Pluto Chiron, but then also the


3703
03:06:33.300 --> 03:06:36.300
fact that he's got certain retrogrades and he's got a lot of potential


3704
03:06:36.300 --> 03:06:39.600
but in order for to him to achieve that potential


3705
03:06:39.600 --> 03:06:42.200
realize it there's certain things. He's got


3706
03:06:42.200 --> 03:06:45.500
to do blah blah and to explain to him because it's


3707
03:06:45.500 --> 03:06:46.100
very important that


3708
03:06:47.100 --> 03:06:48.400
Your natal dreams?


3709
03:06:49.300 --> 03:06:52.600
Versus your dreams in Florida versus your dreams in Texas your


3710
03:06:52.600 --> 03:06:55.300
dreams in Germany your dreams and wherever they all


3711
03:06:55.300 --> 03:06:58.600
change because your mid haven't changes and then here's your


3712
03:06:58.600 --> 03:07:01.700
progressions. And here's where you are now and your son's


3713
03:07:01.700 --> 03:07:04.200
gonna move your midheim is gonna move you're gonna hit it and


3714
03:07:04.200 --> 03:07:07.400
send it flip when you hit an ascendant flip your whole life changes.


3715
03:07:08.200 --> 03:07:09.100
We have all hit.


3716
03:07:10.500 --> 03:07:13.100
Anyone over 30 has hit in a set. Well, that's not true


3717
03:07:13.100 --> 03:07:13.300
either.


3718
03:07:14.800 --> 03:07:18.100
You've hit a sun sign change by then. You're sending


3719
03:07:17.100 --> 03:07:20.400
can take much longer. Anyone who's over 50 is


3720
03:07:20.400 --> 03:07:23.600
definitely hit one. Some people like my said my wife hit one.


3721
03:07:23.600 --> 03:07:25.700
I hit one around 21.


3722
03:07:27.300 --> 03:07:28.400
Twenty One ish


3723
03:07:29.200 --> 03:07:30.800
I can tell you exactly what happened.


3724
03:07:31.700 --> 03:07:34.200
And the easiest thing to determine is usually you


3725
03:07:34.200 --> 03:07:37.500
change the way you dress drastically and then usually


3726
03:07:37.500 --> 03:07:40.800
when I'm trying to hone that down, that's what I'm looking for. When


3727
03:07:40.800 --> 03:07:43.300
did you really change your appearance? Because that's


3728
03:07:43.300 --> 03:07:46.200
the easiest thing to hone down. And I know that when I


3729
03:07:46.200 --> 03:07:49.200
was 21, I stopped dressing so flashy it's because I became


3730
03:07:49.200 --> 03:07:50.100
a rising.


3731
03:07:50.900 --> 03:07:53.400
So you guys can figure that out as well in your


3732
03:07:53.400 --> 03:07:56.300
own charts to see, you know the age in which that happened through


3733
03:07:56.300 --> 03:07:57.300
your progress charts.


3734
03:07:58.800 --> 03:08:01.700
So that answers that I think thanks so much for making space


3735
03:08:01.700 --> 03:08:04.100
sharing your knowledge can't explain how thankful. I am. This


3736
03:08:04.100 --> 03:08:07.200
is my passion. I'm glad you're enjoying this. I'm glad to make


3737
03:08:07.200 --> 03:08:10.400
sense. And you know what? I would


3738
03:08:10.400 --> 03:08:13.100
like to know I'm gonna research after I get off of here


3739
03:08:13.100 --> 03:08:15.600
because I know people know Britney Spears.


3740
03:08:16.500 --> 03:08:19.100
Way more than I do Tony Robbins way more


3741
03:08:19.100 --> 03:08:19.600
than I do.


3742
03:08:20.800 --> 03:08:23.100
And Halle Berry way more than I do.


3743
03:08:23.100 --> 03:08:27.000
I don't know these people very well. I've never been a Starstruck person.


3744
03:08:26.500 --> 03:08:29.400
I just never cared.


3745
03:08:29.400 --> 03:08:32.500
I don't care about athletes or anything like that. I've just


3746
03:08:32.500 --> 03:08:35.100
I know exactly why it's in my chart,


3747
03:08:35.100 --> 03:08:38.700
but I just don't care. I admire people


3748
03:08:38.700 --> 03:08:41.700
for being able to do what they do, but I just never felt


3749
03:08:41.700 --> 03:08:44.200
the rub the relevance of caring about


3750
03:08:44.200 --> 03:08:48.300
all the actions they take and their entire life story into


3751
03:08:47.300 --> 03:08:50.800
what I'm gonna do with my life. And I


3752
03:08:50.800 --> 03:08:54.000
know that sounds I know that comes across very cold,


3753
03:08:53.200 --> 03:08:56.500
but it's just it's my


3754
03:08:56.500 --> 03:08:59.500
energy. I have Saturn in conjunct Venus between


3755
03:08:59.500 --> 03:09:02.700
the third and the 10th house and Libra and Taurus. So it's like it


3756
03:09:02.700 --> 03:09:05.300
makes sense. I know why it happens. I also it's also


3757
03:09:05.300 --> 03:09:08.200
the same reason why I don't like any systems for any


3758
03:09:08.200 --> 03:09:11.400
job that I get into I get in. I do things my own way for that


3759
03:09:11.400 --> 03:09:12.100
reason, so,


3760
03:09:13.300 --> 03:09:16.200
I'm gonna dive into these a bit more myself. See what


3761
03:09:16.200 --> 03:09:19.200
I can find out. Tony Robbins I


3762
03:09:19.200 --> 03:09:19.600
think is


3763
03:09:20.400 --> 03:09:23.300
an extremely fascinating around this whole


3764
03:09:23.300 --> 03:09:26.100
children thing and this I also want to point out


3765
03:09:26.100 --> 03:09:29.300
that you have to pay attention to everything this when I was doing that


3766
03:09:29.300 --> 03:09:32.300
thing here, I miss this and this right here


3767
03:09:32.300 --> 03:09:35.100
is the connection to the partner and the connection


3768
03:09:35.100 --> 03:09:39.700
to the life and the connection to because it


3769
03:09:39.700 --> 03:09:39.800
is


3770
03:09:40.800 --> 03:09:43.500
In Aquarius, and that's up here. It's the connection to


3771
03:09:43.500 --> 03:09:46.500
the child. But the child is there's something different about


3772
03:09:46.500 --> 03:09:49.100
it something there's a Detachment something different or something


3773
03:09:49.100 --> 03:09:52.200
from somebody else which we've talked about.


3774
03:09:52.200 --> 03:09:55.500
But this is his biggest wound. His biggest


3775
03:09:55.500 --> 03:09:57.400
wound comes from his childhood.


3776
03:09:58.500 --> 03:10:01.500
Comes from and that's with his childhood is


3777
03:10:01.500 --> 03:10:04.200
where it manifested with the brain thing. So that was accurate.


3778
03:10:04.900 --> 03:10:07.200
I didn't know that until I


3779
03:10:07.200 --> 03:10:10.500
read it a second ago. And then with his children his first


3780
03:10:10.500 --> 03:10:14.100
child that was all of this here so craziness and


3781
03:10:13.100 --> 03:10:16.500
I'm I'm assuming that because


3782
03:10:16.500 --> 03:10:19.900
there's a square to Neptune and Scorpio


3783
03:10:19.900 --> 03:10:22.100
that we don't know the full picture. So it doesn't really matter how


3784
03:10:22.100 --> 03:10:23.900
much I research I guarantee you.


3785
03:10:24.800 --> 03:10:27.500
That it's not all publicly made aware


3786
03:10:27.500 --> 03:10:31.200
because of like I said this Square that's


3787
03:10:30.200 --> 03:10:33.000
right here and this in conjunction here.


3788
03:10:34.100 --> 03:10:37.400
So what we know versus what's actually the truth, maybe


3789
03:10:37.400 --> 03:10:38.500
a little askew.


3790
03:10:39.600 --> 03:10:43.400
So keep that in mind when you're looking at Pluto Scorpio Neptune


3791
03:10:42.400 --> 03:10:45.000
Pisces that type of energy


3792
03:10:47.200 --> 03:10:47.200
You know.


3793
03:10:50.500 --> 03:10:53.600
Is the ascendant Neptune? Yeah, and the Senate


3794
03:10:53.600 --> 03:10:56.500
Neptune. That's all that's all creating this.


3795
03:10:57.600 --> 03:11:00.100
Agitation here. So in order


3796
03:11:00.100 --> 03:11:03.200
for him to do what he does and have his own business or whatever


3797
03:11:03.200 --> 03:11:04.300
some things.


3798
03:11:05.300 --> 03:11:08.800
Had to be hidden and not revealed. So keep


3799
03:11:08.800 --> 03:11:11.200
that in mind as well. So we may never know the


3800
03:11:11.200 --> 03:11:15.200
full context of this, but this has been fun, Britney


3801
03:11:14.200 --> 03:11:15.700
Spears.


3802
03:11:16.400 --> 03:11:19.200
Tony Robbins Halle Berry, so I never look


3803
03:11:19.200 --> 03:11:22.400
into celebrities charts. So that was interesting for


3804
03:11:22.400 --> 03:11:25.300
me. Thank you guys all for attending live. Thank you


3805
03:11:25.300 --> 03:11:29.600
all for taking this class post, whatever watching


3806
03:11:29.600 --> 03:11:32.300
it over again and stay tuned. If you're


3807
03:11:32.300 --> 03:11:35.700
taking it live tomorrow see extra cartography class the introduction.


3808
03:11:36.800 --> 03:11:37.200
and


3809
03:11:38.800 --> 03:11:41.400
in two weeks, we'll be the manifestation class


3810
03:11:41.400 --> 03:11:44.300
and then I will be taking a very short break


3811
03:11:44.300 --> 03:11:47.300
because we're going to take a trip as a family to Los Angeles because we're


3812
03:11:47.300 --> 03:11:50.300
gonna be moving back and going to find the area we want to move to and then I'll


3813
03:11:50.300 --> 03:11:53.500
be jumping into a lot more classes to dive in. I hope as


3814
03:11:53.500 --> 03:11:56.100
students you take as much of this as you can to apply it


3815
03:11:56.100 --> 03:11:59.400
to get as accurate as possible as you can and then


3816
03:11:59.400 --> 03:12:02.400
develop your own theories because that's what I want for you guys develop


3817
03:12:02.400 --> 03:12:03.900
your own theories find out how


3818
03:12:04.900 --> 03:12:05.800
to create


3819
03:12:06.700 --> 03:12:09.700
patterns observable patterns that apply


3820
03:12:09.700 --> 03:12:12.400
through and through from Reading to reading to reading


3821
03:12:12.400 --> 03:12:15.800
and they're always tried and true and and we


3822
03:12:15.800 --> 03:12:18.600
can together expand the


3823
03:12:18.600 --> 03:12:22.100
knowledge within the astrological science because


3824
03:12:21.100 --> 03:12:24.100
the astrological community in my opinion


3825
03:12:24.100 --> 03:12:26.300
has been so hung up on textbook stuff.


3826
03:12:27.200 --> 03:12:30.100
And doesn't care about how it really plays out in the real world. I think


3827
03:12:30.100 --> 03:12:33.200
you guys are on the right on the right track with the


3828
03:12:33.200 --> 03:12:36.500
right mindset. And if you're here that class in two


3829
03:12:36.500 --> 03:12:39.200
weeks is all about not just putting it together, but now


3830
03:12:39.200 --> 03:12:42.100
taking it the next step and saying okay. I know how it's played out


3831
03:12:42.100 --> 03:12:45.500
in my life. Now. I want something I want to do something with it. What can


3832
03:12:45.500 --> 03:12:47.000
I do with it? And that's manifestation.


3833
03:12:48.900 --> 03:12:51.300
Thank you so much Logan. See you tomorrow looking for


3834
03:12:51.300 --> 03:12:55.100
tomorrow. Looking forward to seeing you guys there. It's great


3835
03:12:54.100 --> 03:12:57.300
after cartography is one


3836
03:12:57.300 --> 03:13:00.800
of my passions. So I'm probably gonna do it just like this and just


3837
03:13:00.800 --> 03:13:03.800
kind of go with it and just do a random person's chart.


3838
03:13:03.800 --> 03:13:06.100
I don't know if I'll do a celebrity again. I'll probably just make it


3839
03:13:06.100 --> 03:13:07.700
completely random because I want to talk about


3840
03:13:08.800 --> 03:13:11.300
and this I could always do a celebrity like live


3841
03:13:11.300 --> 03:13:14.700
maybe one time. I'm live and just talk about like Elvis or


3842
03:13:14.700 --> 03:13:18.700
someone because I noticed the placidus Elvis


3843
03:13:17.700 --> 03:13:20.400
doesn't match the whole science Elvis and


3844
03:13:20.400 --> 03:13:23.800
whole sign shows his residency and his issues with his his father


3845
03:13:23.800 --> 03:13:24.100
and


3846
03:13:24.800 --> 03:13:27.200
and the colonel which I


3847
03:13:27.200 --> 03:13:28.200
learned about colonel.


3848
03:13:29.700 --> 03:13:30.700
Yeah all interesting stuff.


3849
03:13:31.700 --> 03:13:33.300
All right guys. Thanks again. And


3850
03:13:35.200 --> 03:13:36.200
yeah, see you soon.
