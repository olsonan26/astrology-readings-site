=============================================================
VERDICT: THE READING IS **NOT ACCURATE**
=============================================================

MAJOR ERRORS:
-------------
1. **WRONG RISING SIGN**: You said Sagittarius ~13°, but it's actually SCORPIO
   - This throws off THE ENTIRE HOUSE SYSTEM
   - All house interpretations are based on wrong foundations

2. **WRONG HOUSE ASSIGNMENTS**:
   - 6th House is ARIES (not Taurus)
   - 11th House is VIRGO (not Libra)  
   - Moon is in 1st House (not 12th)

3. **TRANSIT MISMATCH**:
   - Uranus IS in Taurus (✅ correct), BUT:
   - In Cassie's chart, Taurus is her 7th House (Partnerships), NOT 6th House (Work)
   - So Uranus is affecting her RELATIONSHIPS/PARTNERSHIPS, not her work zone

4. **SOUTH NODE CLAIM**: We couldn't verify South Node position in current transits

=============================================================
THE CORRECT INTERPRETATION (Using Your System's Math):
=============================================================

**WHY IS CASSIE FEELING ATTACKED AT WORK & BY FRIENDS?**

Let me analyze with the CORRECT chart data:

**1. WORK ISSUES (6th House = ARIES):**
   - Her 6th House of work is ARIES
   - Ruler: MARS, located in LIBRA in the 12th House
   - **This is KEY**: Mars (her work ruler) is in the 12th House of hidden enemies, 
     self-undoing, and things happening behind the scenes
   - Mars in Libra = trying to keep peace, be diplomatic, but IN THE 12TH HOUSE 
     means coworkers might be talking behind her back or she's perceiving passive 
     aggression that's not always direct
   - **Saturn is IN her 6th House** (Saturn in Aries at 20°):
     * Saturn = restrictions, lessons, challenges, authority figures
     * This creates REAL workplace tension, difficult bosses, or feeling restricted 
       in her daily work life
     * She likely feels like she has to work harder than others or faces more 
       obstacles at work

**2. FRIEND ISSUES (11th House = VIRGO):**
   - Her 11th House of friends/networks is VIRGO
   - **Mercury AND Venus are BOTH in the 11th House** (Mercury 14° Virgo, Venus 23° Virgo)
   - Mercury = how she communicates with friends
   - Venus = what she values in friendships, how she relates
   - BOTH in Virgo = she's analytical, critical (of self and others), detail-oriented 
     in friendships
   - The issue: Virgo energy can come across as judgmental or nitpicky
   - With BOTH personal planets here, she might be overthinking friend dynamics or 
     picking up on every small slight

**3. MOON IN SCORPIO IN THE 1ST HOUSE:**
   - This is HUGE and you got the SIGN right but WRONG house placement
   - Moon in 1st House = her emotions are ON DISPLAY, not hidden
   - Scorpio Moon = intense, suspicious, picks up on betrayal energy IMMEDIATELY
   - At 23° Scorpio = very late degree, almost at the Sagittarius boundary
   - **Chiron is ALSO in the 1st House** (Scorpio 14°):
     * Chiron = the wound, insecurity, where we feel broken
     * In 1st House = wound around IDENTITY, how she's perceived
     * She likely feels inherently flawed or "too much" for people
     * This amplifies her feeling of being attacked because her wound IS about 
       being seen/rejected

**4. CURRENT TRANSITS:**
   - **Uranus in Taurus** is transiting her **7TH HOUSE (Partnerships)**:
     * NOT her 6th House (work) as you claimed
     * This creates chaos/upheaval in ONE-ON-ONE RELATIONSHIPS
     * Could affect close work partnerships or friendships that feel more like partnerships
     * Uranus here = sudden changes, people acting unpredictably in relationships

=============================================================
WHAT'S ACTUALLY HAPPENING (Correct Analysis):
=============================================================

**The Real Story:**
1. **Saturn in her 6th House** is creating REAL work challenges and restrictions
2. **Mars (work ruler) in the 12th House** means workplace conflict is hidden, 
   passive-aggressive, or happening behind her back
3. **Mercury + Venus in 11th House (Virgo)** makes her hyper-aware of friend 
   dynamics and potentially critical
4. **Scorpio Moon + Chiron in 1st House** means she FEELS everything intensely 
   and has a core wound around being accepted as she is
5. **Uranus in 7th House** is shaking up her close relationships and partnerships

**How to Stop It (Actual Advice):**
- The Saturn 6th House lesson: Work IS hard right now. This is a Saturn test. 
  Build better boundaries, don't expect it to be easy
- Mars in 12th: Not everyone is against you. Some conflict is in your head because 
  Mars is in the house of the unconscious. Journal about work frustrations
- Moon/Chiron in 1st: Your emotional intensity is VISIBLE. People can see when 
  you're hurt. Work on not taking everything personally - that's the Chiron healing
- Friends (11th House): You're being too analytical about friendships. Virgo 
  energy needs to chill and stop dissecting every interaction
- Uranus in 7th: Relationships ARE unstable right now. Accept the chaos as 
  necessary change, not an attack

=============================================================
CONCLUSION:
=============================================================

**Your reading has the RIGHT VIBE** (she's feeling attacked at work and by friends), 
but **the ASTROLOGICAL REASONING is completely wrong** because you calculated the 
wrong rising sign, which shifted all the houses.

The core issue ISN'T external transits as much as it's:
1. Saturn's presence IN her 6th House (work challenges are real and structural)
2. Her work ruler Mars hiding in the 12th House (hidden workplace dynamics)
3. Her Scorpio Moon + Chiron in 1st House (she FEELS attacked because she has 
   a core identity wound and emotional intensity on display)

**The advice you gave is okay in spirit, but not based on correct astrology.**

**TO FIX**: Recalculate with SCORPIO RISING and rewrite the entire interpretation.
