Ok yes, this update helps a lot. Here’s the same message in your same vibe/words, but with the correct chart math you listed.

So I was already pretty much done writing what my astrology system would say about your chart right now.

Mind you this isn’t going to be your normal astrology because mine is based off of math.

Ok so first thing, your rising is Scorpio, not Sagittarius. That changes the whole house layout, so the “why am I being attacked” part hits different than what I originally said.

You’re a Scorpio rising. And that’s why this is showing up as “I feel everything, I feel it fast, and I can feel when something is off” energy.

Your work and daily routine zone is Aries, and you literally have Saturn in Aries at 20° sitting in that work zone. Saturn is pressure, restriction, tests, authority, feeling like you have to work harder than everyone else, or feeling like you’re being judged or blocked. So if work feels heavy, unfair, tense with bosses, or like people are making it harder than it needs to be, that’s exactly what I see.

But here’s the part that makes it feel like “attacks”. The ruler of your work zone is Mars, and your Mars is in Libra at 28° in the 12th house. 12th house is the hidden stuff, behind the scenes, subconscious, quiet enemies, passive aggression, weird energy you can’t prove but you can feel. Mars in Libra also tries to keep things “nice” and smooth, so you might be holding back, being diplomatic, trying not to start anything, meanwhile stuff is still happening sideways. So it can feel like people are acting cool to your face but weird behind your back, or like the conflict is sneaky instead of direct.

Now for friends, your friends and network zone is Virgo, not Libra. And you have Mercury at 14° Virgo and Venus at 23° Virgo in that friends zone. So you’re not crazy for picking up on every tiny shift, because your chart literally reads people and reads energy in friendships. The downside is Virgo can overanalyze, it can dissect everything, it can notice every small slight, and that can make friend drama feel bigger because your mind is catching every detail.

And your moon is Scorpio at 23° in your 1st house, not the 12th. That means your emotions are not hidden at all. They’re on you. People can see it in your face, your energy, your eyes, even when you try to act normal. Scorpio moon also feels betrayal energy immediately, like you don’t need proof, you just know. And you also have Chiron in Scorpio at 14° in your 1st house, which is a wound around identity and being seen, being accepted, feeling like people misunderstand you or project onto you. So when people come at you, it hits the core, not just the surface.

Also, Uranus is in Taurus at 27° right now (Jan 28, 2026), but in your chart Taurus is your 7th house, partnerships. So the chaos is more in close one on one connections, relationships, close friendships that feel like a “bond”, even work partnerships. Uranus is still unpredictability, sudden changes, people acting different out of nowhere, but it’s hitting the relationship zone, not the work zone.

So basically what I get from this:

Work chaos = Saturn in your work zone (Aries 6th) making work feel heavy and testing you, plus your work ruler Mars in Libra 28° sitting in the 12th, which makes conflict feel hidden, passive-aggressive, behind the scenes.

Friend conflict = Virgo 11th house with Mercury 14° and Venus 23°, so you’re hyper aware of dynamics, and it can turn into overthinking, or friends feeling nitpicky, judgmental, or just not aligned with your standards.

And your Scorpio moon at 23° in the 1st house makes you feel everything intensely, fast, and visibly, plus Chiron 14° Scorpio makes “being attacked” feel personal and deep.

And how to stop it? WELL, don’t chase it or try to prove yourself to everyone. Just keep your circle tight, don’t react fast or more shit will happen, and let the people who are showing their true colors remove themselves. Also at work, boundaries are the whole lesson right now. Saturn is basically forcing you to get strict about what you tolerate, what you respond to, and what you stop entertaining. And with Mars in the 12th, not everything needs confrontation, some stuff needs you to move quietly, document things, keep your peace, and stop feeding the drama.

This is a clearing season, not a “fix everybody” season if that makes sense??
