00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:05.100
Rewind welcome to


2
00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:08.200
the rebel Academy astrology manifestation crash


3
00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.600
course class number five, which wraps


4
00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:14.100
it up is basically a zero to 100. If you


5
00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:16.000
got to this class you already know this but zero to


6
00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.400
100 from nothing to everything and I called this one time to


7
00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.300
manifest and I was doing a little bit of play on words here because


8
00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:25.800
Divine timing is a huge part of what we're doing here. Now,


9
00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.700
I did break this down into three main components


10
00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:31.600
for this class. I don't have any materials for


11
00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.300
this class other than my little splash here. So there's nothing


12
00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:37.600
for you to like review and go over. It's just gonna be showing you


13
00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.300
how to do this and a little bit of a conversation here.


14
00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.000
But this is all about taking the energies that we


15
00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.100
already have because the average person who gets


16
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.400
into astrology professional astrologers. They believe that


17
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.600
energy is energy plays out. It's like fate Destiny


18
00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.200
like it's a roadmap that you can guide but you


19
00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:59.100
can't actually change and I strongly disagree with that. I don't


20
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.800
think there's a point in learning this aside from knowledge if that


21
00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.400
were the case I think and I know because I've used


22
00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.500
it I've manifested so many things for myself both with


23
00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.300
and without astrology and I'll tell you as a hell a lot easier when you


24
00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:15.300
have astrology to do so


25
00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:16.100
and


26
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.400
Just knowing that you can take energies that may not


27
00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.200
feel so great for you and turn them into something that


28
00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.400
is magnificent for you. There's nothing like it


29
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.400
and you're watching other people who don't believe in astrology who


30
00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.500
even the ones who do who don't believe that you can manifest with


31
00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.400
astrology which I think might be worse, you know,


32
00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.400
sit there and kind of fall behind now the energies for


33
00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.700
today's course line up perfectly with this being the culmination


34
00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.400
of this or this


35
00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.400
class rather the culmination of this course, so I'm a huge


36
00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.100
fan of that lines up as a sex tone of my North.


37
00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.100
No, it's you know, the Moon is trying my Saturn there's


38
00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.200
a, you know, a lot of other things going on. So I love it


39
00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.400
and I'm hoping that this is exactly what you guys need because


40
00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.400
again, the whole purpose in my


41
00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:06.400
opinion of learning astrology is not just to understand


42
00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.300
yourself, but to actually be able to do something with that. So


43
00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.200
we're gonna start off. I picked a random person.


44
00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.100
This is not a celebrity. There's no tricks here. I


45
00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:19.300
literally put in random numbers and gave this person


46
00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:22.500
a fictitious name and we're going to go from there. The three


47
00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.800
main components of today's class are mindset


48
00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.800
transmutation and divine


49
00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:29.300
timing.


50
00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.200
So that is going to be what we


51
00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.600
go through mindset transmutation and divine timing


52
00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.500
before I even get into a chart. I want to talk a little bit about


53
00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.300
mindset and mindset is


54
00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:44.200
so important because it's kind of like what I


55
00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.700
just talked about where a lot of astrologers don't believe that you


56
00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.200
can transmute with these energies that you can actually


57
00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.400
do something with them. They believe that they are static faded points


58
00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.300
and that's all they are. And I I do think that some


59
00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:59.200
of them are I think that some of those energies are a little too intense for


60
00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.600
us mortal human beings to be able to do much with but


61
00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:04.600
I think the rest of them are completely malleable.


62
00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.300
And we can live the type of life that we want to and if you


63
00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:12.300
manifestation-wise what you


64
00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.600
believe is what you achieve.


65
00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.800
Meaning if you believe that this cannot work, it won't


66
00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:21.300
if you believe that astrology is a


67
00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:24.200
roadmap to your fate and destiny and you you're just along for


68
00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:27.100
the ride like a side seat passenger, then that's what you will be.


69
00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.700
But if you believe that you can harness this energy and


70
00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:33.600
transmute it and turn it then you can I


71
00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:36.300
promise you you can because I've done it none of


72
00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:39.400
this matters. If you Vibe with toxic people


73
00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.500
or toxic situations, I cannot


74
00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:45.200
help you if that's the type of life you continue to


75
00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.300
lead. So if you really want to manifest things in your


76
00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:51.500
life, you're going to have to set yourself a mindset.


77
00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:55.900
That allows you a clear path forward and in


78
00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:58.100
my podcast in a lot of my videos on social


79
00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:01.500
media I talk about what I've kind of coined as my catchphrase,


80
00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:02.600
which is Vibe higher.


81
00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:06.200
And when I say Vibe higher I'm talking about there is


82
00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:09.700
a natural resonating frequency that all energy


83
00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:12.300
plays out and I talk about this in the fourth class a


84
00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:15.200
little bit, but it's astrology is predictable.


85
00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:18.400
And the reason is predictable is because there's


86
00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:21.100
a low frequency and then there is a spectrum going


87
00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:22.400
all the way up to the highest frequency.


88
00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:26.500
And I am not the person to tell you what the highest


89
00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:30.100
frequency is, but you know as different


90
00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:32.000
situations come across and that's what


91
00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:35.600
you have to figure out what you want to harness and embrace and manifest


92
00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:35.800
with.


93
00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:40.000
If you have people in your life that


94
00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:42.400
bring you down and you refuse to


95
00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:45.500
remove these people from your life and sometimes they're family


96
00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:48.500
right you might have a mom who's just super toxic


97
00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:51.500
who tells you all the time like criticizes you


98
00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:54.500
all the time and kind of gets in your head and I'm not saying don't ever


99
00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:57.200
talk to your mom again, but maybe if you talk to her


100
00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:00.600
every day, maybe you should limit that the two to three times a week or something


101
00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:03.300
along that that you can kind of manage that


102
00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:06.300
stress and whatnot. If it's a toxic relationship, maybe you're


103
00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:09.500
at a precipice where you have to make a choice whether it's


104
00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:12.400
right for you to move forward or if there's something


105
00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:16.100
you can work on within the relationship so you can both move forward or if


106
00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:19.300
it's time for you to exit and


107
00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:21.400
do things for yourself and harness


108
00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:22.300
that Aries energy.


109
00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:26.500
This includes friends. It includes work situation.


110
00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:29.500
It's not always people sometimes at work.


111
00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:32.200
It's not the people. It's the job itself that you just don't like


112
00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:35.300
there's a component of it. That just doesn't feel fulfilling.


113
00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:39.400
Sometimes it has to and that's Often by the way career and


114
00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:42.500
work. I see that all the time. Sometimes it's friends when


115
00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:45.300
it's the people thing. Sometimes it's your relationship with money.


116
00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:49.100
Sometimes you chase things that you shouldn't Chase and


117
00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:51.500
you need to bring it back a little bit and say, you know, it's it's


118
00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:54.300
okay to want money. It's okay to do things to


119
00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:57.300
achieve money. But if your relationship with money is poor


120
00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:00.500
then that is a toxic situation where money comes


121
00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:03.100
in you spend it right away. That is something that you have to


122
00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:06.200
address and that's not to say go the other way and become an


123
00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:09.000
extremist because that's opposite your energy most likely.


124
00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:12.700
And that's a drastic change. That's really unnecessary. Just


125
00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:15.200
having a better relationship within your energies to


126
00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:17.600
understand yourself will help immensely.


127
00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:22.700
When you're looking at your chart Chiron understanding your


128
00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:25.900
wounds understanding your insecurities and


129
00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:29.000
the things that hold you back within your own psyche is


130
00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:31.200
extremely important. I always talk about


131
00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:34.300
this. I'm adding two planets to this. There are five planets that


132
00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:38.100
I think you need to pay attention to in order to manifest properly three


133
00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:39.500
of them. I always talk about


134
00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:43.300
Chiron again is one and in astrology. I


135
00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:46.400
understand Chiron which has been back and


136
00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:49.600
forth demoted promoted to a dwarf


137
00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:52.500
planet a small planet of whatever it was an asteroid


138
00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:55.400
a comet whatever it is. It's out there


139
00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:58.000
and in astrology we call it a


140
00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:58.200
planet.


141
00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:02.300
So Chiron huge huge because if


142
00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:05.600
you're looking for your limitations and you want to go beyond


143
00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:08.300
those limitations, then you need to understand what's holding you


144
00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:09.000
back in the first place.


145
00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:13.700
The next two I'm going to group together because they do have similarities in


146
00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:16.200
the context of what I'm speaking and that is the


147
00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:20.100
moon which I talk about constantly and Neptune and


148
00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:22.500
both of these planets revolve around fear.


149
00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:25.400
You have to know what your limitations are which


150
00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:28.900
include what you are afraid of your intuition


151
00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:32.900
and your family and your your soul


152
00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:35.700
level fears the ones that come from your family


153
00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:38.400
your upbringing your conditioning your emotions


154
00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:41.200
versus the things you don't know and the things


155
00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:44.300
you're afraid of because you feel like either you're going to lose


156
00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:47.900
it or you don't know enough about it to achieve it and


157
00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:50.100
you have to address both of those fears because one of


158
00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:53.800
them comes from conditioning and the other one comes from abstractness and


159
00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:56.500
both of them are based off of fear. And this


160
00:07:56.500 --> 00:07:57.700
is why a lot of times we talk about


161
00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:02.700
in the energies of different planets that different planets


162
00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:05.200
mean different things and some of them have a


163
00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:08.500
little bit of overlap to the other one. Like if I'm looking at the chart


164
00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:11.300
of an actor or an actress oftentimes, I


165
00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:14.400
will see both Neptune and Jupiter have a prominent


166
00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:17.700
role and it's not because they're co-rulers or anything like that because in different


167
00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:20.900
ways they have certain traits that overlap within


168
00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:23.300
theatrical experience. One of


169
00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:24.700
them has to do with fantasy.


170
00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:28.300
And the media and film and things of that nature with


171
00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:31.100
the creativity that's expressed. And the other one has to


172
00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:34.300
do with storytelling and experiences and philosophy that


173
00:08:34.300 --> 00:08:37.900
can create a good Storyteller who creates


174
00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:41.900
believable stories in a fantasy fictitious, you


175
00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:43.500
know, liberally speaking way


176
00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:46.500
and both of those go hand in hand when it comes to creative people


177
00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:47.500
who are in the film industry.


178
00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:51.400
So you have to know again those energies Moon and


179
00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:54.200
Neptune for Fears the next one another one. I talk about all the time


180
00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:55.200
is Pluto.


181
00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:59.400
Pluto is the ruler of the underworld. It's the upheaval. It's


182
00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:02.800
all the things deep embedded in your psychology, which


183
00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:05.800
is not your subconscious. The Neptune


184
00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:08.300
is also your subconscious and you do have to be aware of your


185
00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:11.400
subconscious traits and behaviors patterns and


186
00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:14.400
habits, but Pluto is deep down.


187
00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:18.500
It's things you bottled up. It's things that that


188
00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:20.400
kind of stir inside and you


189
00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:23.400
do not want these things coming out you have to address Pluto and


190
00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:26.100
and really get in tune with


191
00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:29.100
your inner self the Deep hidden parts of you that you don't share with


192
00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:32.300
everybody else the secrets and you have to come to terms with all


193
00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:35.100
this because Pluto is also personal power. It is


194
00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:38.000
inner power. It is regener. I can't


195
00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:41.300
say that word regenerative properties that you have. It is


196
00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:45.100
the Phoenix and anytime you're talking about manifestation. You


197
00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:47.200
have to realize that you have to


198
00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:48.800
also be okay with failure.


199
00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:52.700
Because anytime you're achieving something, I guarantee


200
00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:55.800
you. You didn't get it on the first try if you did nice Stroke


201
00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:58.300
of Luck, but every single time is not going to happen that way


202
00:09:58.300 --> 00:10:00.700
failure true failure.


203
00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:03.500
Means you fell down you never got back up.


204
00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:05.300
That's the mindset.


205
00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:08.800
Anyone who is successful has failed numerous times?


206
00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:10.400
the smart


207
00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:14.300
failures are the people who look at


208
00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:17.300
how they failed why they failed they take the stuff that


209
00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:19.500
did not cause them the film they keep it.


210
00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:23.400
They take the stuff that did cause that failure and change


211
00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:26.600
it. So they're not starting from scratch. They're not abandoning. They're


212
00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:29.000
moving forward by tweaking the things that did not


213
00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:32.100
work so that they can achieve the success that they're looking


214
00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:36.300
for. But Pluto is that inner power it is that regeneration it


215
00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:38.200
is that Strife that


216
00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:42.000
Obsession and that manifestation requires Obsession


217
00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:44.100
because it's the thing you want.


218
00:10:45.100 --> 00:10:48.300
It's not a it's not a genie. It's not three wishes in


219
00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:51.100
a lamp. You don't just wake up one day and say there it


220
00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:54.300
is. That's what I wanted. I got it. Now. There are little


221
00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:57.300
things that you can manifest. You can really spend time


222
00:10:57.300 --> 00:11:00.400
thinking about something driving something really small but a


223
00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:03.400
lot of the things we want to manifest are huge, especially if


224
00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:06.200
any of us are dreamers. I know I'm a dreamer. I know


225
00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:08.600
everything that I want to do is Grand scale.


226
00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:12.100
And some people will tell you have to take a step at a step


227
00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:15.300
at a time do a little by little and whatnot. And I'm just like


228
00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:18.600
no that doesn't Vibe with me. I don't do things little at


229
00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:21.500
a time. I take huge leaps and that


230
00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:24.000
is part of Leo. I'm a Leo Rising that's part of


231
00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:27.200
my energy your energy may be Capricorn. You may


232
00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:30.200
have to set Milestones. You may have to go slow and steady.


233
00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:34.200
If you have Virgo, you have to go service to others. It


234
00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:37.300
has to be a daily thing of routine and you have to be careful that you're


235
00:11:37.300 --> 00:11:39.500
not overly criticizing yourself every single.


236
00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:44.000
you know and then back to Leo Leo is about risk-taking risk


237
00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:46.500
is a Leo trait and the inner


238
00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:49.700
child and the things you want and almost that that innocence,


239
00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:50.300
but that


240
00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:55.900
Untested worldly ambition that


241
00:11:55.900 --> 00:11:58.200
you can have that fire that literally lights inside.


242
00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:02.000
You say I'm not happy unless I have this that's Leo every


243
00:12:01.100 --> 00:12:04.400
single sign in the Zodiac has something


244
00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:07.300
that will help you grabble into


245
00:12:07.300 --> 00:12:10.400
and move forward with and then the aspects and everything else.


246
00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:10.700
So


247
00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:14.300
That's extremely important Pluto is your power. If


248
00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:17.800
you want to know where you'll be powerful if you want to know where your magnetism


249
00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:21.200
is, that's Pluto if you're looking for Success life


250
00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:23.200
is a popularity contest and I


251
00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:24.400
people hate when I say that.


252
00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:26.200
But prove me wrong.


253
00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:30.500
Life is a popularity contest people have to like you if you're selling


254
00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:33.200
something people have to like you if you want to be seen if you


255
00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:36.600
are an actor if people don't like you they don't want to watch your movies. If


256
00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:39.300
you're selling a product they you know, they if


257
00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:42.300
you're selling a house you're the realtor and they don't like


258
00:12:42.300 --> 00:12:42.400
you.


259
00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:46.300
They're either not gonna buy the house or they're gonna get rid of


260
00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:49.400
you and replace you in the process of buying whatever house it


261
00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:49.500
is.


262
00:12:50.300 --> 00:12:53.400
It's it's a popularity contest and you got to figure out your way in


263
00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:56.400
there because that is also part of manifestation is understanding the


264
00:12:56.400 --> 00:12:59.700
game. No one talks about that part the game.


265
00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:03.800
Europe you're a chess piece in on a


266
00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:06.200
chessboard. If you don't understand the game or the


267
00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:09.700
ways that you can play it or the ways you can manipulate the system. Then you're


268
00:13:09.700 --> 00:13:12.100
going to be you know, that pawn that gets swiped


269
00:13:12.100 --> 00:13:15.300
off at the beginning and you're gonna have to play the game starting from


270
00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:18.300
scratch again and it's just gonna keep going you're gonna be in that cycle


271
00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:21.500
Pluto is your power. If you do not harness Pluto,


272
00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:24.400
it's everyone else's power and it becomes your chaos.


273
00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:26.800
the final planet


274
00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:30.300
is what I would believe is the most


275
00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:31.200
obvious planet.


276
00:13:32.100 --> 00:13:35.100
It is in all social media. It's in


277
00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:38.400
all pop culture astrology. Everybody talks about this planet,


278
00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:41.600
but nobody uses it and that


279
00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:44.700
is the sun. The sun is Your vitality.


280
00:13:44.700 --> 00:13:47.200
The sun is your risk. The sun is what


281
00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:50.600
keeps you moving keeps you alive and pushes you forward. It's your


282
00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:53.300
creative expression and your inner child, right? We talk about this


283
00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:55.700
in the first or second class or both of them.


284
00:13:56.500 --> 00:13:59.500
The sun is so important but most people get hung up


285
00:13:59.500 --> 00:14:02.500
when all of the intricacies of the real world


286
00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:04.800
because the sun is not part of the real world.


287
00:14:05.700 --> 00:14:08.700
The sun is life is why it rules children you brought


288
00:14:08.700 --> 00:14:09.500
that into the world.


289
00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:14.600
But it's also your happiness because it's Your vitality.


290
00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:17.300
It's literally that fire inside you so wherever your son


291
00:14:17.300 --> 00:14:20.200
is, wherever your Leo placements are wherever your what's in your fifth house.


292
00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:23.300
All of that is extremely important, but people


293
00:14:23.300 --> 00:14:26.100
neglect it. They look for their midheaven. When sometimes we


294
00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:29.200
don't even use that or they look for the 10th house or the second house and like


295
00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:32.300
oh, I need to make money my second house in Venus and they


296
00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:33.500
start there. That's great.


297
00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:37.100
But if you don't incorporate the rest of it you're not going


298
00:14:37.100 --> 00:14:40.200
to be happy and you could be wealthy, but you won't be


299
00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:43.800
happy and we need the full package manifestation. Nobody


300
00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:46.800
manifests to be rich and depressed.


301
00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:49.600
We don't do that. I actually


302
00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:55.500
I was listening to a song at the gym earlier today and I


303
00:14:55.500 --> 00:14:58.800
sent the lyrics to my buddy because I I Vibe heavily


304
00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:02.700
with like a certain section of the song and it's it's a


305
00:15:02.700 --> 00:15:05.200
little crass but there's one part that ends the


306
00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:08.100
verse that says yeah, I want to


307
00:15:08.100 --> 00:15:11.300
be broke forever. Yeah, that's that ish that no


308
00:15:11.300 --> 00:15:13.300
one ever said right but


309
00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:17.600
We can want to manifest money. We can want to manifest abundance


310
00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:20.900
happiness a partner the dream job a place


311
00:15:20.900 --> 00:15:23.400
that we live. There's anything you can really manifest almost


312
00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:26.100
anything within the the energy and the parameters of what you


313
00:15:26.100 --> 00:15:28.800
have. But if you only chase after that.


314
00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:33.300
Taylor got it Jeezy if you only chase after


315
00:15:33.300 --> 00:15:33.500
that.


316
00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:37.400
You were not going to be happy because you are neglecting your sun sign


317
00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:40.200
and your sun sign has connections aspects. We


318
00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:43.400
talked about that in a previous class and it has a position. It


319
00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:46.100
has a degree in a deck in and it has a house placement.


320
00:15:46.900 --> 00:15:49.300
And you have to see where it is and you have


321
00:15:49.300 --> 00:15:52.300
to look at your progressions because through time it changes.


322
00:15:53.100 --> 00:15:55.300
your natal chart will always be there, but if you move


323
00:15:56.300 --> 00:15:59.400
Or if you just get older it moves


324
00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:02.500
the progressions are based off of one degree per year and


325
00:16:02.500 --> 00:16:02.800
your son.


326
00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:06.400
So you can move three to four signs within


327
00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:09.300
a lifetime depending on what degree you started at.


328
00:16:09.900 --> 00:16:12.200
So it's important that you pay attention all that and you


329
00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:15.200
align your current position that we're going to get into this and with


330
00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:19.000
Divine timing, but you align your current position with what's attainable at


331
00:16:18.100 --> 00:16:21.700
the time and then you focus and


332
00:16:21.700 --> 00:16:24.200
you hyper focus and you make sure that this is the only


333
00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:27.600
thing and anything that stops me from doing this is gone.


334
00:16:28.700 --> 00:16:29.700
That's mindset.


335
00:16:30.700 --> 00:16:33.400
That mindset is extremely important. It is


336
00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:35.400
the one thing that people do not.


337
00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:40.100
Pave the way for themselves because they allow toxic


338
00:16:39.100 --> 00:16:41.600
situations toxic thoughts.


339
00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:43.300
toxic people


340
00:16:44.300 --> 00:16:47.400
all of that to continue and more importantly something that's


341
00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:50.800
maybe a little more abstract toxic Cycles when


342
00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:53.600
things happen. They run their course, we hit


343
00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:56.300
an ending. We come back to the beginning. We do it all over again.


344
00:16:56.300 --> 00:16:59.200
You noticing your lifetime you have Cycles because if you


345
00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:02.300
look at your chart Planet sit in a certain place and they


346
00:17:02.300 --> 00:17:05.600
sit in a certain order and as events come in transits


347
00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:08.300
come they always go this way in perpetual motion. They


348
00:17:08.300 --> 00:17:11.500
move forward and yeah, we get a chance through some retrogrades, but


349
00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:14.300
it has to hit that planet in order to us to snap for us to


350
00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:17.100
snap out of it. If we're not cognizant of the fact that


351
00:17:17.100 --> 00:17:20.500
astrology exists and you're in this class, which means you know


352
00:17:20.500 --> 00:17:21.100
it exists.


353
00:17:22.900 --> 00:17:25.800
The next stage is transmutation, right?


354
00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:29.000
So now we have the mindset down. We know what


355
00:17:28.100 --> 00:17:31.300
we want and it has to be something


356
00:17:31.300 --> 00:17:34.100
that is a attainable. It can be a big thing, but


357
00:17:34.100 --> 00:17:35.000
it has to be attainable.


358
00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:39.300
And it has to be something that we are willing to put in


359
00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:42.500
the work for something. We really want not something small


360
00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:45.400
not something trivial you can get those things sure you can manifest them


361
00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:48.300
but something you really want and it can be things that


362
00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:51.300
some people don't believe you could actually have any


363
00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:53.000
control over but you can


364
00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:57.300
So once you have your mindset down that's locked, right? So


365
00:17:57.300 --> 00:18:01.200
now we can move past mindset transmutation. That


366
00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:03.200
is the key. So I'm going


367
00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:04.200
to move this on out of the way.


368
00:18:05.300 --> 00:18:06.800
And we have Dolores here.


369
00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:10.900
Now Dolores is some random woman. She


370
00:18:10.900 --> 00:18:13.400
was born in 1979. I don't


371
00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:16.600
know why anyone still naming their child Dolores at


372
00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:20.000
this point, but she was born May 11th 1979 in


373
00:18:19.300 --> 00:18:23.400
Memphis, Tennessee at 11:16 am and


374
00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:26.500
this is dolores's chart.


375
00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:30.400
So this is a fictitious person. I just chose some


376
00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:33.200
random dates and


377
00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:36.300
numbers and what I plugged it in and this is Dolores. Okay,


378
00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:39.200
so we have 1979 actually, it's the second attempt because I


379
00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:42.700
tried to do somebody from like 1930 and for the


380
00:18:42.700 --> 00:18:45.400
purpose of explaining this there were


381
00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:49.300
too many stelliums and it would take me too long to do whenever you


382
00:18:49.300 --> 00:18:52.300
see stelliums and satellidiums in a chart you do have


383
00:18:52.300 --> 00:18:55.800
to allow a lot for more time because you


384
00:18:55.800 --> 00:18:58.200
have to break down all the energies that are feeding into


385
00:18:58.200 --> 00:19:01.100
one source. So stallions do add time and


386
00:19:01.100 --> 00:19:04.100
effort. So I intentionally move that one. We do


387
00:19:04.100 --> 00:19:05.500
have two in here Plus.


388
00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:09.100
Juno we have two in here plus Chiron and then we


389
00:19:09.100 --> 00:19:12.700
have two in here. That's all fine. Right? This is pretty standard. But when


390
00:19:12.700 --> 00:19:15.400
you seem all grouped you have to sit there and break


391
00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:18.200
it down and for the purpose of teaching this I just


392
00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:21.200
wasn't looking to do that to extend the class. I want to teach this the best


393
00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:24.300
I can quickly so that you can get this


394
00:19:24.300 --> 00:19:25.700
and you can watch it over and over again.


395
00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:29.800
Angie says wow. My son is now in Taurus. I


396
00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:32.700
would not have known that it moves. Ah see


397
00:19:32.700 --> 00:19:36.300
learning something has nothing to do with the actual class. No progressions


398
00:19:35.300 --> 00:19:38.200
are extremely important understanding the


399
00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:41.200
new midheaven. For instance. If the mid Heaven shifted


400
00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:44.500
understanding where your moon is in progressions your moon


401
00:19:44.500 --> 00:19:47.100
moves, too to every two to two and a half years moves into


402
00:19:47.100 --> 00:19:51.100
a new sign as well. So you're constantly


403
00:19:51.100 --> 00:19:54.400
in a varying emotional state on top


404
00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:58.100
of the fact that the moon itself in transit orbiting the


405
00:19:58.100 --> 00:20:01.700
Earth moves quite quickly as well and is two


406
00:20:01.700 --> 00:20:04.600
to two and a half days in every sign. So Moon the


407
00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:07.600
Moon I'm gonna be teaching a moon class that moon is


408
00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:11.400
sometimes a little biha, but


409
00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:13.600
if you understand what her purpose


410
00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:16.600
is, then you can utilize it. So the agitation


411
00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:18.400
can always be transmuted.


412
00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:22.900
And before I even get in here, let me talk real quick about the


413
00:20:22.900 --> 00:20:24.100
purpose of transmuting.


414
00:20:24.900 --> 00:20:27.300
We've already done classes one through four. So I'm not going back


415
00:20:27.300 --> 00:20:30.900
to teach you any of the basics any of the energy what the


416
00:20:30.900 --> 00:20:33.100
aspects are. I'll highlight them as I teach and


417
00:20:33.100 --> 00:20:36.300
go and we're not gonna I'm not even going to talk about how I pull


418
00:20:36.300 --> 00:20:38.700
all this together. You're just gonna watch as we do it.


419
00:20:39.300 --> 00:20:42.600
But the purpose of transmuting is to understand now


420
00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:45.300
we talked about retrogrades in another class. I'm


421
00:20:45.300 --> 00:20:48.600
going to which I will put out soon which is utilizing


422
00:20:48.600 --> 00:20:52.200
retrogrades for positive action and understanding


423
00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:55.200
that the the observable


424
00:20:54.200 --> 00:20:57.000
backwards motion, which is


425
00:20:57.200 --> 00:21:00.300
not real. It is only in perspective of where we are


426
00:21:00.300 --> 00:21:00.800
on the planet.


427
00:21:01.900 --> 00:21:04.300
Creates an influx or not in


428
00:21:04.300 --> 00:21:07.600
flux a flux in the way the energy hits us


429
00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:08.900
and it works inwardly.


430
00:21:09.700 --> 00:21:12.400
You can call it backwards because that's what the planets.


431
00:21:12.900 --> 00:21:15.400
Visually doing but it's really a flux.


432
00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:18.800
It's an inward thing. So as that planet the transits


433
00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:21.700
hit us. It's causing that energy


434
00:21:21.700 --> 00:21:24.100
to go Inward and for us to


435
00:21:24.100 --> 00:21:25.500
basically do reflection.


436
00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:26.600
now


437
00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:30.000
with transmutation


438
00:21:30.900 --> 00:21:34.200
Whether it is retrograde planets, actually,


439
00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:36.400
I'll just stick on that people talk


440
00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:39.100
about Mercury retrogrades all the time as a Transit right


441
00:21:39.100 --> 00:21:42.200
in a previous class. We talked about whether what it or what it


442
00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:45.500
would be like in your natal chart but as transits is


443
00:21:45.500 --> 00:21:48.300
what we usually talk about and people talk all the time about how


444
00:21:48.300 --> 00:21:51.400
it's so bad Communications terrible and contracts are


445
00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:54.800
bad and you shouldn't sign anything and you


446
00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:57.700
know, your electronics are going to go crazy and communication is


447
00:21:57.700 --> 00:21:58.900
gonna get bad. You're gonna argue.


448
00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:03.300
First thing is all of


449
00:22:03.300 --> 00:22:06.100
that is all dependent on what sign it's in what


450
00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:09.300
house it's it's a transiting what other planets are being


451
00:22:09.300 --> 00:22:10.100
aspected.


452
00:22:10.900 --> 00:22:14.500
So people generalize Mercury retrograde


453
00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:16.500
based off of perceived Notions of


454
00:22:16.500 --> 00:22:19.000
what may have happened to them or someone they know in the


455
00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:22.000
past because of aspects that they were unaware of


456
00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:26.100
Matt retrogrades are not bad retrogrades are really


457
00:22:26.100 --> 00:22:29.500
good actually because they help restore you and change course


458
00:22:29.500 --> 00:22:32.400
when you could be, you know, hitting an iceberg


459
00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:33.700
helps you move around.


460
00:22:35.700 --> 00:22:37.600
transmuting the energy is to say


461
00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:41.100
there's a retrograde happening. I'm using it for this


462
00:22:41.100 --> 00:22:44.600
purpose, but there's a retrograde happening over my third house. So


463
00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:47.300
contracts that have to do a communication. Let's say


464
00:22:47.300 --> 00:22:50.200
I'm buying a car the third house has to do with buying a car and I


465
00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:53.500
look to see how it's aspecting Venus and whatnot. And


466
00:22:53.500 --> 00:22:56.700
I realize that there's going to be something wrong with the


467
00:22:56.700 --> 00:22:59.300
contract. There's gonna be something I have


468
00:22:59.300 --> 00:23:02.800
to rethink or renegotiate that has


469
00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:04.100
to do with buying this car.


470
00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:07.400
And I shouldn't sign the contract but


471
00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:10.900
the difference is I shouldn't sign that contract


472
00:23:10.900 --> 00:23:13.400
the way that it is not I shouldn't


473
00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:17.100
sign any contract right because I


474
00:23:16.100 --> 00:23:19.500
now know that the retrograde is hitting and


475
00:23:19.500 --> 00:23:23.000
this is transmutation. It's because I know it's there. I


476
00:23:22.100 --> 00:23:25.000
know what it means and because I know what it means.


477
00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:29.100
I know what it could mean and this is what transmutation is.


478
00:23:28.100 --> 00:23:31.900
What does it mean? How will


479
00:23:31.900 --> 00:23:32.400
it play out?


480
00:23:33.500 --> 00:23:36.600
The way it plays out is always default. We know that


481
00:23:36.600 --> 00:23:39.200
it will play out in its lowest vibration unless you have a bunch


482
00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:42.500
of other people who also know astrology who are changing the energies. It's


483
00:23:42.500 --> 00:23:45.900
still within the confines of whatever that energy means, but it


484
00:23:45.900 --> 00:23:48.300
could play out in a higher vibration if somebody else knows, but


485
00:23:48.300 --> 00:23:51.400
at this point of time not many people know how to transmute energy, so


486
00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:55.200
It plays out in its lowest vibrational setting so, you


487
00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:58.300
know, what's going to happen, you know, there's going


488
00:23:58.300 --> 00:24:01.400
to be something wrong. And if you look at all the aspects at the time of


489
00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:04.200
what's going on, you can figure out exactly what it has


490
00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:07.300
to do with. Is it something mechanical? Is it


491
00:24:07.300 --> 00:24:10.600
something with the car? Is it something to do with the salesperson? Is


492
00:24:10.600 --> 00:24:13.400
this something to do with the price? Is it something you can look? Is


493
00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:16.100
it the insurance is it the add-ons is it what is


494
00:24:16.100 --> 00:24:18.300
it and you can figure that out now that I know?


495
00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:21.400
I'm armed. This is knowledge.


496
00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:25.900
I can go in there and on my volition.


497
00:24:26.500 --> 00:24:29.200
Renegotiate this contract knowing it needs


498
00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:32.300
to be renegotiated. Anyway, I can't move forward.


499
00:24:32.300 --> 00:24:35.300
So now I have to make the changes and based


500
00:24:35.300 --> 00:24:38.300
off of all the transits and aspects that are happening at the moment.


501
00:24:39.800 --> 00:24:43.000
I know what I need to do. That is what transmutation is


502
00:24:42.500 --> 00:24:45.200
to transmute the energies meaning to


503
00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:48.300
take what was going to happen and make it be


504
00:24:48.300 --> 00:24:51.200
something I want to happen within the confines of


505
00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:52.100
those Energies.


506
00:24:52.900 --> 00:24:55.400
And that is the key to everything we're doing


507
00:24:55.400 --> 00:24:58.700
here with the time to manifest and then the whole


508
00:24:58.700 --> 00:25:01.600
transits part is the timing the Divine timing


509
00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:04.000
we're gonna get to that towards the


510
00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:07.600
end. I'm going to spend a little bit of time on transmutation. I'm gonna


511
00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:10.500
let you guys ask some questions and then we're just


512
00:25:10.500 --> 00:25:12.900
going to kind of, you know, make our way through this so


513
00:25:13.900 --> 00:25:16.800
How do the energies play out and why


514
00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:19.700
now? I'm gonna hold off on transits, even


515
00:25:19.700 --> 00:25:22.300
though I use that in the example because that's more


516
00:25:22.300 --> 00:25:25.400
about Divine timing. I'm going to use natal energies. I'm


517
00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:29.000
gonna see how does this stuff play out specifically here,


518
00:25:28.600 --> 00:25:31.400
right? I'm gonna start with money because money


519
00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:34.100
money and love are the two main topics


520
00:25:34.100 --> 00:25:37.100
everyone wants to know because they they revolve their


521
00:25:37.100 --> 00:25:39.200
entire life around these two things even though


522
00:25:40.300 --> 00:25:43.700
They are not everything they are literally two twelfths one


523
00:25:43.700 --> 00:25:45.400
sixth of your life those two things.


524
00:25:46.100 --> 00:25:49.700
And that's only if you give one


525
00:25:49.700 --> 00:25:52.000
thing to each house, it's so much


526
00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:55.200
and people put so much stock in relationships and so much


527
00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:59.300
stocking money. And yes partnership is wonderful your


528
00:25:58.300 --> 00:26:02.300
energy may actually support or promote that


529
00:26:02.300 --> 00:26:04.700
money is needed and necessary.


530
00:26:05.700 --> 00:26:08.300
Not everybody wants to be a billionaire. Not everybody wants


531
00:26:08.300 --> 00:26:09.000
to be partnered.


532
00:26:09.700 --> 00:26:12.400
And we have to respect that when you're doing readings as well by staying


533
00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:15.500
objective, but this is all about how do my energy sit in


534
00:26:15.500 --> 00:26:18.600
my chart. How does it normally play out? And I know that because of the lowest vibrational


535
00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:21.700
setting and how can it play out? What


536
00:26:21.700 --> 00:26:24.500
do all these energies mean? And what are the different


537
00:26:24.500 --> 00:26:27.200
things based off a brainstorming because that's


538
00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:30.500
basically what you're doing when you're transmuting energy instead of


539
00:26:30.500 --> 00:26:30.800
saying


540
00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:34.900
I need to force the energy to do this you say


541
00:26:34.900 --> 00:26:37.200
here's what's going to happen. Here's the


542
00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:41.100
energies. Here's like a ballpark of


543
00:26:42.300 --> 00:26:45.400
what I would like to happen and then you dive into


544
00:26:45.400 --> 00:26:48.300
the energy into the glyphs into the aspects and everything


545
00:26:48.300 --> 00:26:49.200
that's sitting here and say


546
00:26:50.300 --> 00:26:53.500
How can I change this to do something different?


547
00:26:53.500 --> 00:26:56.800
How can I use it myself and using the energies is


548
00:26:56.800 --> 00:26:59.500
not something you need to like teach yourself or


549
00:26:59.500 --> 00:27:02.800
focus on you can literally just if it's


550
00:27:02.800 --> 00:27:06.200
Mars you can literally act or react


551
00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:08.500
or do if it


552
00:27:08.500 --> 00:27:11.300
is Saturn you can focus if it


553
00:27:11.300 --> 00:27:14.200
is Neptune you can dream or be creative. If it is


554
00:27:14.200 --> 00:27:17.200
the sun you can harness that confidence. You can


555
00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:20.300
use those powers for yourself. If it


556
00:27:20.300 --> 00:27:23.800
is Pluto you can have that inner understanding and that transmuting


557
00:27:23.800 --> 00:27:26.800
and fixational something kind of like Uranus where


558
00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:29.200
you can say, this is what it is. This is how I want to change it.


559
00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:33.500
And we want to use the energies differently some


560
00:27:33.500 --> 00:27:36.700
of them. We don't some of them were like, you know, what leave that alone because


561
00:27:36.700 --> 00:27:39.200
that's great. But over here, there's one thing


562
00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:42.200
and that's a big thing too is sometimes the energy is all play out


563
00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:45.200
nicely except one or two things and you're like,


564
00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:48.500
I just need to change these two things so that they don't play out poorly and


565
00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:51.100
they play out in my benefit and I want to also


566
00:27:53.100 --> 00:27:56.400
to make this point here is that energy is cannot


567
00:27:56.400 --> 00:27:59.600
manifest two different ways at the same time, which


568
00:27:59.600 --> 00:28:02.600
means if you are using the energy, it can't


569
00:28:02.600 --> 00:28:05.300
do something else because you are telling the energy


570
00:28:05.300 --> 00:28:07.900
at what vibration to resonate at.


571
00:28:09.100 --> 00:28:12.200
Angie says I like those keywords for each plant out.


572
00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:12.900
Nice.


573
00:28:14.200 --> 00:28:17.300
That was just randomly. None of this is


574
00:28:17.300 --> 00:28:17.400
scripted.


575
00:28:18.300 --> 00:28:22.200
Awesome, that is the embodiment and I've actually


576
00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:25.600
thought about like some of the stuff I've taught in these classes that this crash


577
00:28:25.600 --> 00:28:28.200
course. I mean, it's a crash course, so I need to kind of go into detail a bit


578
00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:31.500
more for some of these but I think I'm gonna do that more for the planets and


579
00:28:31.500 --> 00:28:34.400
the signs and the houses. I think I may actually expand upon that


580
00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:34.600
because


581
00:28:35.700 --> 00:28:38.300
there's a lot that I wasn't able to say even in a


582
00:28:38.300 --> 00:28:41.400
two and a half hour class that has to do with that and how


583
00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:44.300
I actually use these energies which will


584
00:28:44.300 --> 00:28:46.200
be super helpful for this class as well.


585
00:28:46.900 --> 00:28:49.300
But here we are we have dolores's we're


586
00:28:49.300 --> 00:28:52.500
only going to fixate on transmutation right now. Again, Divine timing


587
00:28:52.500 --> 00:28:53.200
will come soon.


588
00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:56.100
And I have all of this energy here now.


589
00:28:57.300 --> 00:29:01.200
I'm not going to do an angel chart here, but I know a couple of things so I know


590
00:29:00.200 --> 00:29:03.400
that Dolores is


591
00:29:03.400 --> 00:29:06.200
a Leo Rising so I know kind of what she


592
00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:09.600
looks like. I know that the hair is something to


593
00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:12.500
look at whether it's poofy curly big small.


594
00:29:12.500 --> 00:29:15.200
They're not there. Whatever. That's something that I'll have


595
00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:16.000
to look at.


596
00:29:16.900 --> 00:29:19.500
I know that she goes


597
00:29:19.500 --> 00:29:23.300
through Stark Transformations


598
00:29:22.300 --> 00:29:25.400
when she is feeling a certain


599
00:29:25.400 --> 00:29:28.300
way or if she needs to present herself in public that


600
00:29:28.300 --> 00:29:31.500
she transforms. How do I know that I know


601
00:29:31.500 --> 00:29:34.200
that because Leo Rising the ruler is the


602
00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:36.100
sun and the Sun is opposite.


603
00:29:37.800 --> 00:29:39.800
Uranus in Scorpio


604
00:29:40.700 --> 00:29:43.700
now a couple of things you can do with this right one


605
00:29:43.700 --> 00:29:46.500
is I know that that's kind of how it


606
00:29:46.500 --> 00:29:50.000
goes. But I also know that she can go through like huge


607
00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:51.300
transformations.


608
00:29:52.700 --> 00:29:56.900
Based off of this and bring in the the 12th


609
00:29:56.900 --> 00:29:59.400
house ruler is cancer, which is the moon over here,


610
00:29:59.400 --> 00:30:02.700
which is in here as well. So if this person knowing


611
00:30:02.700 --> 00:30:05.600
that let's just say because Leo is film


612
00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:08.000
and entertainment. It's not film as much


613
00:30:08.100 --> 00:30:11.100
as it's entertainment stage, you know


614
00:30:11.100 --> 00:30:13.200
things that are fun Recreation Sports and whatnot.


615
00:30:14.200 --> 00:30:17.300
I know that this person


616
00:30:17.300 --> 00:30:21.000
when they if they were to go on film and kind


617
00:30:20.100 --> 00:30:23.500
of do that that they their hair would be


618
00:30:23.500 --> 00:30:26.800
a significant contributor of each character that


619
00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:29.200
they would play right? So that's the


620
00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:32.300
the information of how it can


621
00:30:32.300 --> 00:30:34.500
play out. And I know that


622
00:30:37.400 --> 00:30:40.800
that this person needs to have input there's


623
00:30:40.800 --> 00:30:43.400
a subconscious attachment to the changes here


624
00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:46.400
and they have to have input because the Moon is


625
00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:49.300
attached here. So what if I needed what if


626
00:30:49.300 --> 00:30:49.500
I am?


627
00:30:50.500 --> 00:30:53.100
How did you get that from the 12th house?


628
00:30:54.200 --> 00:30:55.100
I have to backtrack a minute.


629
00:30:55.800 --> 00:30:58.200
First house was Leo


630
00:30:58.200 --> 00:31:01.600
the rulers the sun that's in the tenth House of public in


631
00:31:01.600 --> 00:31:03.100
Taurus, which is the Arts.


632
00:31:04.600 --> 00:31:07.300
I'm ignoring Chiron for a second. The sun is


633
00:31:07.300 --> 00:31:10.300
opposite Uranus Uranus is conjunct. The Moon.


634
00:31:10.300 --> 00:31:13.500
The Moon is the ruler of the twelfth house the 12th house rules


635
00:31:13.500 --> 00:31:13.800
film.


636
00:31:16.400 --> 00:31:19.500
The sun Leo, which is The Sun Also rules


637
00:31:19.500 --> 00:31:22.800
entertainment. So I'm just combining


638
00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:23.200
these.


639
00:31:24.500 --> 00:31:27.600
With this opposition here, and this is an opposition.


640
00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:30.600
So this person does not do this normally unless they


641
00:31:30.600 --> 00:31:32.300
need to bring in that 12th house energy.


642
00:31:35.700 --> 00:31:36.900
So what if


643
00:31:37.700 --> 00:31:40.800
Hair from one film from 12. Yes. So what


644
00:31:40.800 --> 00:31:41.200
if


645
00:31:41.900 --> 00:31:44.100
I need this person to be


646
00:31:44.100 --> 00:31:45.300
in their natural state.


647
00:31:47.400 --> 00:31:50.300
To or what? If not me, let's


648
00:31:50.300 --> 00:31:53.400
say it's them let's say they want to take a


649
00:31:53.400 --> 00:31:56.500
role but they can't go through a transformation the


650
00:31:56.500 --> 00:31:59.700
role actually calls for them as they look the


651
00:31:59.700 --> 00:32:02.200
way they normally look how would they do that?


652
00:32:02.200 --> 00:32:05.400
Well, there's an insecurity that has to do with


653
00:32:05.400 --> 00:32:08.600
their hair and their presence also, you


654
00:32:08.600 --> 00:32:11.700
know being in groups and where's Virgo and you


655
00:32:11.700 --> 00:32:14.800
know the the money that's that's the value


656
00:32:14.800 --> 00:32:17.500
and the value could be also attached to Public Image.


657
00:32:18.600 --> 00:32:21.600
So this person wants a strong Public Image


658
00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:24.800
they want strong appearance and they are very self-conscious and


659
00:32:24.800 --> 00:32:27.600
insecure about it and they have their own self worth. It issues


660
00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:28.600
that came from the father.


661
00:32:30.100 --> 00:32:33.700
And perhaps the father didn't have much money and that,


662
00:32:33.700 --> 00:32:36.900
you know resonated heavily and that drives this


663
00:32:36.900 --> 00:32:39.100
person forward but now they're taking a role. Let's say


664
00:32:39.100 --> 00:32:42.500
It's Entertainment film and they want to use like


665
00:32:42.500 --> 00:32:45.400
I said, they're exact thing. Well, they have to use the energy


666
00:32:45.400 --> 00:32:49.100
that they have here. Now Chiron here is insecurity. And


667
00:32:48.100 --> 00:32:51.300
if they do not use this transformation and they


668
00:32:51.300 --> 00:32:54.600
don't use all this energy here Chiron will


669
00:32:54.600 --> 00:32:57.700
naturally show itself that insecurity will


670
00:32:57.700 --> 00:33:00.600
come out they were either not take the role or push


671
00:33:00.600 --> 00:33:01.200
against the role.


672
00:33:02.200 --> 00:33:05.500
Or they will show up and when


673
00:33:05.500 --> 00:33:08.500
they do it the insecurity will highlight and they


674
00:33:08.500 --> 00:33:11.600
will likely not get the job unless that's what the role calls


675
00:33:11.600 --> 00:33:14.800
for like an insecure person, right? So in


676
00:33:14.800 --> 00:33:17.300
order to transmute the energies and


677
00:33:17.300 --> 00:33:21.600
not have it be here you have to look at what each of these means so


678
00:33:20.600 --> 00:33:23.200
we know that we have the chart ruler. We


679
00:33:23.200 --> 00:33:26.900
know we have the sun sun is Vitality. It's children. It's what


680
00:33:26.900 --> 00:33:29.300
not. So this person can do


681
00:33:29.300 --> 00:33:32.400
a role that has to do with art that has


682
00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:35.400
to do with money. It has to do with Finance. Maybe there's things there


683
00:33:35.400 --> 00:33:38.900
and how they can fix it. So that role even if


684
00:33:38.900 --> 00:33:41.300
the role itself has nothing to


685
00:33:41.300 --> 00:33:42.300
do with


686
00:33:43.300 --> 00:33:44.900
Let's say it's a Capital One commercial.


687
00:33:45.700 --> 00:33:47.100
Right, and it's like credit repair.


688
00:33:48.300 --> 00:33:51.400
Right. So this would make sense. She'd take this role and


689
00:33:51.400 --> 00:33:54.300
she would fixate she would focus in on the


690
00:33:54.300 --> 00:33:57.400
fact that you're fixing people's money. You're fixing people's money.


691
00:33:57.400 --> 00:34:00.500
You're fixing people's money and then for the time being because it


692
00:34:00.500 --> 00:34:03.900
is in opposition. We're gonna let go of


693
00:34:03.900 --> 00:34:07.000
this side of the opposition or we're


694
00:34:06.200 --> 00:34:09.500
going to balance in here. I'm going to make friends


695
00:34:09.500 --> 00:34:11.700
with the women that are there.


696
00:34:12.700 --> 00:34:15.200
And I'm going to use that to kind of hold on


697
00:34:15.200 --> 00:34:18.500
to it. Now. That's easy since we already have credit repair


698
00:34:18.500 --> 00:34:21.300
as a part of it. But let's say It's a pasta commercial.


699
00:34:21.300 --> 00:34:25.200
It's like Ragu or something like that. Well, that was


700
00:34:25.200 --> 00:34:27.000
random, but Taurus does rule food.


701
00:34:27.700 --> 00:34:30.400
So what do we have to do in order to do this? Well


702
00:34:31.400 --> 00:34:34.400
We have to realize that mercury. I swear


703
00:34:34.400 --> 00:34:37.000
I pick this randomly Mercury right here the sitting there


704
00:34:37.900 --> 00:34:41.000
rules communication that's good for you know talking speaking


705
00:34:40.400 --> 00:34:41.700
public, whatever.


706
00:34:43.600 --> 00:34:47.200
We have to realize that it will siblings cousins coworkers


707
00:34:46.200 --> 00:34:50.100
and that it also rules sales.


708
00:34:49.100 --> 00:34:52.800
Right so we may


709
00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:56.100
have to set up a scenario in our head that we


710
00:34:55.100 --> 00:34:57.000
have to help.


711
00:34:57.900 --> 00:34:59.700
The 10th house the company.


712
00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:01.300
sell


713
00:35:02.300 --> 00:35:06.600
this through our performance and an act


714
00:35:06.600 --> 00:35:09.200
like the you know with a fake family.


715
00:35:10.300 --> 00:35:13.300
And maybe that's an option is that they can have a fake family and


716
00:35:13.300 --> 00:35:16.300
then there they will make either they'll you know,


717
00:35:16.300 --> 00:35:19.500
try to make deep bonds with them or try to find out something secret


718
00:35:19.500 --> 00:35:22.500
about the other person to kind of help their character and that


719
00:35:22.500 --> 00:35:25.600
will help them here kind of pull all this together because


720
00:35:25.600 --> 00:35:28.700
they're using Taurus instead of money instead of


721
00:35:28.700 --> 00:35:31.400
What Not they're using it as food. They're


722
00:35:31.400 --> 00:35:34.100
like, okay, it's food. It's a commercial for Food they'll probably be drawn to


723
00:35:34.100 --> 00:35:37.000
it anyway, but the Chiron you don't want the insecurity. So you


724
00:35:37.100 --> 00:35:38.000
have to use the healing.


725
00:35:38.900 --> 00:35:42.100
And that's what all transmutation is about is. I


726
00:35:41.100 --> 00:35:44.400
know that if I go somewhere and I'm out in


727
00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:47.100
public Chiron is going to impact me in a very


728
00:35:47.100 --> 00:35:47.800
negative way.


729
00:35:48.900 --> 00:35:52.000
I have astrology is perception. It's perspective.


730
00:35:51.900 --> 00:35:54.500
I have to use this and


731
00:35:54.500 --> 00:35:57.300
develop the scenario in my head and even tell


732
00:35:57.300 --> 00:36:00.600
myself even speak it out loud, right? Because it's


733
00:36:00.600 --> 00:36:04.100
Public Image. I am selling Ragu because


734
00:36:04.100 --> 00:36:04.600
you can't


735
00:36:05.700 --> 00:36:08.600
Maybe not too much ego but the sun is ego.


736
00:36:08.600 --> 00:36:12.900
And if you use the sun's positive traits


737
00:36:12.900 --> 00:36:16.000
which are humor and joking and you


738
00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:18.400
know, all the entertainment you can you can


739
00:36:18.400 --> 00:36:21.400
come across as someone who is like I am your sales rep. I


740
00:36:21.400 --> 00:36:25.000
am the one who's going to fix your brand. I'm going to make sure everybody buys


741
00:36:24.800 --> 00:36:27.100
this blah and you're


742
00:36:27.100 --> 00:36:30.500
gonna harp on the focus on the Chiron here.


743
00:36:30.500 --> 00:36:34.900
So you're using all of this energy here and and


744
00:36:33.900 --> 00:36:35.900
pulling it all together.


745
00:36:36.700 --> 00:36:39.100
as opposed to how it would have normally played out, which is


746
00:36:39.100 --> 00:36:41.600
I show up in my stage fright shows in


747
00:36:42.300 --> 00:36:45.300
Stage fright cannot be a part of it. If you want to nail this


748
00:36:45.300 --> 00:36:48.800
if you want to get this audition, if you want to get this roll if it's


749
00:36:48.800 --> 00:36:49.600
film based.


750
00:36:51.500 --> 00:36:52.100
How did you get?


751
00:36:53.700 --> 00:36:54.700
not fake well


752
00:36:56.200 --> 00:36:59.200
Make friends, even if they're not so in the film industry when


753
00:36:59.200 --> 00:37:02.100
you show up on set there are.


754
00:37:03.100 --> 00:37:05.900
People there you can make friends Uranus rules friendship.


755
00:37:06.700 --> 00:37:09.400
So since the sun is opposite you want to bring this


756
00:37:09.400 --> 00:37:11.200
together. You want to balance this here?


757
00:37:12.700 --> 00:37:15.600
So you want to balance you want to bring in family and friends,


758
00:37:15.600 --> 00:37:18.800
you can bring these two energies here and


759
00:37:18.800 --> 00:37:22.600
be like the friends are extended family and it's


760
00:37:22.600 --> 00:37:25.100
someone else's family and you can play that role and you can


761
00:37:25.100 --> 00:37:28.600
bring that in that would be the best way to do it if you're solo.


762
00:37:29.900 --> 00:37:32.100
If you're doing this role in your solo there is no


763
00:37:32.100 --> 00:37:36.500
fake family here. Then what you'll end up having to do is using


764
00:37:35.500 --> 00:37:38.100
this energy in a different way. So


765
00:37:38.100 --> 00:37:40.700
I would have to use fourth house.


766
00:37:41.700 --> 00:37:44.100
Scorpio either a very deep embedded


767
00:37:46.600 --> 00:37:47.200
memory


768
00:37:48.400 --> 00:37:51.700
of your memory or thought of


769
00:37:51.700 --> 00:37:54.200
your family that no one else knows something very


770
00:37:54.200 --> 00:37:56.000
secret deep in your psychology or


771
00:37:57.400 --> 00:38:00.100
the easier way is to use someone else's fent because


772
00:38:00.100 --> 00:38:03.200
Scorpio is other people's stuff. It's the fourth house,


773
00:38:03.200 --> 00:38:06.000
which is family or homes. Use other people's stuff


774
00:38:06.700 --> 00:38:08.800
in something that was happen randomly.


775
00:38:09.700 --> 00:38:11.300
And just think of that and use that.


776
00:38:12.400 --> 00:38:16.100
That would be the best way to do it or picture a future.


777
00:38:18.100 --> 00:38:21.900
Picture a future like someone else's family in the future because you're


778
00:38:21.900 --> 00:38:24.300
using this and I know some of the sounds like


779
00:38:24.300 --> 00:38:27.000
erratic and out of base or whatnot, but I


780
00:38:27.500 --> 00:38:29.300
promise you it works. It's like


781
00:38:30.900 --> 00:38:35.000
It's like a distorted affirmations, right affirmations


782
00:38:33.200 --> 00:38:36.400
are set things that you focus


783
00:38:36.400 --> 00:38:40.000
on so that you can achieve the things that you want with astrology.


784
00:38:39.200 --> 00:38:42.700
These energies are present and these energies play


785
00:38:42.700 --> 00:38:45.800
out a certain way. You do not want this often on


786
00:38:45.800 --> 00:38:48.600
again based off of your fears because this is stage fright.


787
00:38:48.600 --> 00:38:51.300
This could be stage fright, like deep stage fright.


788
00:38:51.300 --> 00:38:54.100
You don't want this to play out in order to overcome it


789
00:38:54.100 --> 00:38:56.100
you have to use that energy in a different way.


790
00:38:59.900 --> 00:39:02.300
Oh awesome, not erratic. The way you explain. It's really


791
00:39:02.300 --> 00:39:05.500
helpful, especially in Breakdown. I'm glad let me know if you guys are following. Please


792
00:39:05.500 --> 00:39:09.000
keep commenting because this is an interesting topic and


793
00:39:08.300 --> 00:39:11.100
to be honest. I wasn't really sure how I want to approach


794
00:39:11.100 --> 00:39:14.200
this to me. It comes very naturally because I've been doing this for years,


795
00:39:14.200 --> 00:39:17.900
but this is actually the first time I've fully explained.


796
00:39:18.800 --> 00:39:21.800
How to use energies in your favor to


797
00:39:21.800 --> 00:39:25.400
manifest the things that you want. So it's exciting


798
00:39:25.400 --> 00:39:28.000
for me that I'm get I get to teach this to you. But at the same


799
00:39:28.200 --> 00:39:31.100
time I use it all day long, but I don't actually get to


800
00:39:32.300 --> 00:39:34.100
kind of, you know use it too much.


801
00:39:35.200 --> 00:39:38.400
So that's one scenario. So I want to open up to you


802
00:39:38.400 --> 00:39:41.400
guys real quick that are in the live class


803
00:39:41.400 --> 00:39:41.700
here.


804
00:39:42.500 --> 00:39:43.700
And you can pick any topic.


805
00:39:45.300 --> 00:39:49.200
Or this is a real test for me, by the way, because this is a random person. You


806
00:39:48.200 --> 00:39:51.300
can pick any topic and you can


807
00:39:51.300 --> 00:39:54.600
say, you know this person they want


808
00:39:54.600 --> 00:39:56.500
to do this with their life.


809
00:39:57.800 --> 00:40:00.100
So I'll like I said, I'll open up to you


810
00:40:00.100 --> 00:40:03.300
guys just choose something. It can be loved it can be money. It could


811
00:40:03.300 --> 00:40:04.100
be career. It can be.


812
00:40:04.900 --> 00:40:07.200
It can be anything and then I will show


813
00:40:07.200 --> 00:40:08.400
you with this chart.


814
00:40:09.300 --> 00:40:12.200
How they could attain the thing that you're looking


815
00:40:12.200 --> 00:40:15.200
for or if they can't attain that how they can


816
00:40:15.200 --> 00:40:18.200
attain something that does align with their energies.


817
00:40:18.200 --> 00:40:21.400
This person wants to travel perfect. Well the


818
00:40:21.400 --> 00:40:23.400
beautiful thing with this is


819
00:40:26.900 --> 00:40:29.600
that their their ninth house


820
00:40:29.600 --> 00:40:32.100
ruler is in the ninth house. So this is a this is a


821
00:40:32.100 --> 00:40:35.400
good instantly an easy one, but there's a good start here. This person


822
00:40:35.400 --> 00:40:38.200
has the opportunity to travel once to


823
00:40:38.200 --> 00:40:41.200
travel and enjoys traveling for the sake of doing so now here's the key


824
00:40:41.200 --> 00:40:45.400
is there is both Aries Mars, which


825
00:40:45.400 --> 00:40:48.500
is the ruler here and Venus and


826
00:40:48.500 --> 00:40:52.200
Juno here. Now, if you think about what these energies


827
00:40:51.200 --> 00:40:54.800
actually signify that means there's a solo


828
00:40:54.800 --> 00:40:56.000
type of


829
00:40:58.100 --> 00:41:01.500
energy in here and a couples Partners type


830
00:41:01.500 --> 00:41:04.400
of energy here. So I've got conflicting energy.


831
00:41:04.400 --> 00:41:07.100
So this is actually a really good example because from the


832
00:41:07.100 --> 00:41:10.200
base, it's like okay, they travel they want to travel and they travel for


833
00:41:10.200 --> 00:41:13.200
the sake of traveling which is great when they want to travel


834
00:41:13.200 --> 00:41:16.600
they do it, but then we have this partnership and we have the Vesta


835
00:41:16.600 --> 00:41:18.900
that's in there as well. Which is that spark of life here.


836
00:41:19.800 --> 00:41:22.100
First thing we always do is we go in we see


837
00:41:22.100 --> 00:41:25.700
what what would normally happen here. Well, the first thing is they likely travel


838
00:41:25.700 --> 00:41:28.500
with partners and they like to explore brand


839
00:41:28.500 --> 00:41:31.700
new places, right? Because we have two indications here.


840
00:41:31.700 --> 00:41:34.200
Usually someone that they're really really close to


841
00:41:34.200 --> 00:41:37.500
or somebody that is a romantic partner of


842
00:41:37.500 --> 00:41:40.500
sorts and they like to do it in luxury.


843
00:41:40.500 --> 00:41:43.200
So they probably like to go first class. Like if


844
00:41:43.200 --> 00:41:46.100
they especially if they've never done first class before they like


845
00:41:46.100 --> 00:41:49.200
to do first class if they've never there's a


846
00:41:49.200 --> 00:41:53.500
sense of adventure here, so maybe it's like they want to travel and skydive with


847
00:41:52.500 --> 00:41:55.300
this Aries Mars energy


848
00:41:55.300 --> 00:41:58.300
here over Hawaii or something along those lines, right? We


849
00:41:58.300 --> 00:41:59.400
also have mercury


850
00:42:00.200 --> 00:42:03.400
in the 10th house at one degree, which means that spilling over with


851
00:42:03.400 --> 00:42:07.000
the rest of this into the ninth house. So Authority Public


852
00:42:06.300 --> 00:42:09.700
Image, they like to be seen they like to be out. They're


853
00:42:09.700 --> 00:42:13.200
not trying to go to a hotel into some hidden Place nature


854
00:42:12.200 --> 00:42:15.500
is very important to where they go. So Hawaii again lines


855
00:42:15.500 --> 00:42:18.400
up with it, but they want to be there. So Honolulu, you


856
00:42:18.400 --> 00:42:21.500
know as opposed to like one of the smaller islands and again


857
00:42:21.500 --> 00:42:22.400
nature as well.


858
00:42:23.400 --> 00:42:26.500
Chirons there. I'm going to ignore Chiron for the sake of this. I'm just


859
00:42:26.500 --> 00:42:29.200
gonna keep keep it moving. Keep it moving. So we have the


860
00:42:29.200 --> 00:42:32.500
the ruler of the ninth house here. We know that it's at 26 degrees


861
00:42:32.500 --> 00:42:35.800
Lilith. This is interesting a trying


862
00:42:35.800 --> 00:42:38.700
with Lilith Lilith. Is that raw sexual power that


863
00:42:38.700 --> 00:42:41.000
raw and Aries is also


864
00:42:42.500 --> 00:42:45.600
Sex as well. So this person could enjoy getting


865
00:42:45.600 --> 00:42:48.400
a little Freaky Deaky out there when they


866
00:42:48.400 --> 00:42:51.600
go vacation like they like to do it as a romantic kind of


867
00:42:51.600 --> 00:42:54.200
gesture adventure and romance would


868
00:42:54.200 --> 00:42:57.600
be a huge part of this and they really want to do something where they can have a


869
00:42:57.600 --> 00:43:00.300
lot of fun have a lot of entertainment and that entertainment


870
00:43:00.300 --> 00:43:03.600
again is out there. They like to eat good food, but they


871
00:43:03.600 --> 00:43:06.200
do have to be careful with this Chiron, which I said I was gonna ignore but they


872
00:43:06.200 --> 00:43:10.400
have to be careful with this Chiron that they do not eat the wrong things because


873
00:43:09.400 --> 00:43:11.800
they could have


874
00:43:13.400 --> 00:43:16.100
like structural issues when it comes


875
00:43:16.100 --> 00:43:19.300
to food and whatnot. They could have reactions. They just


876
00:43:19.300 --> 00:43:21.700
have to make sure that they are good with that.


877
00:43:22.600 --> 00:43:25.400
I also have 26 to 19 doesn't really


878
00:43:25.400 --> 00:43:28.400
count 18 to 20 note. Nothing to


879
00:43:28.400 --> 00:43:31.500
worry about there 29. So we have a square to


880
00:43:31.500 --> 00:43:34.200
the part of Fortune. So they probably like to spend a lot


881
00:43:34.200 --> 00:43:37.100
of money which means they in order to


882
00:43:37.100 --> 00:43:40.300
vacation. They now this


883
00:43:40.300 --> 00:43:43.400
is actually really good to understand so they like to vacation places


884
00:43:43.400 --> 00:43:46.300
and they like to live in luxury and kind of do things like that


885
00:43:46.300 --> 00:43:49.400
but we have a square here between Mars and


886
00:43:49.400 --> 00:43:53.700
the part of Fortune and then we have a a sex tile.


887
00:43:55.800 --> 00:43:58.900
Um here to polish now.


888
00:43:58.900 --> 00:44:01.100
We also have Juno at 28 degrees, which means


889
00:44:01.100 --> 00:44:04.200
when you combine these two it has to


890
00:44:04.200 --> 00:44:07.600
do with requiring both people to have money and work


891
00:44:07.600 --> 00:44:10.200
for it to be able to do that now if they're smart then they'll


892
00:44:10.200 --> 00:44:10.400
take


893
00:44:11.400 --> 00:44:14.500
This energy and they will know they'll


894
00:44:14.500 --> 00:44:17.700
take it further into Saturn in


895
00:44:17.700 --> 00:44:20.200
their second house. We have the North Node there. So


896
00:44:20.200 --> 00:44:23.300
this won't be easy at first but they'll take this energy and that


897
00:44:23.300 --> 00:44:26.400
will tie back into their career and they will position themselves in


898
00:44:26.400 --> 00:44:29.300
a in a place of in a place of


899
00:44:29.300 --> 00:44:32.400
power in a lead role or something


900
00:44:32.400 --> 00:44:35.500
along those lines where they're able to make the


901
00:44:35.500 --> 00:44:38.800
type of money. They want either they're an entrepreneur or


902
00:44:38.800 --> 00:44:41.500
they are they work with their partner


903
00:44:41.500 --> 00:44:42.900
or they do something along those lines.


904
00:44:43.800 --> 00:44:46.200
And they build something right? That's the best


905
00:44:46.200 --> 00:44:49.700
way for this person to do it and that's part of the transmuting


906
00:44:49.700 --> 00:44:52.700
because there's the conflict here between these two energies


907
00:44:52.700 --> 00:44:55.900
here and the part of Fortune which means it's expensive. It's


908
00:44:55.900 --> 00:44:58.300
a lot of money for them to go and their work


909
00:44:58.300 --> 00:45:02.000
may not pay enough. So in order to change this career and


910
00:45:01.400 --> 00:45:04.300
that square, they either need to put in more


911
00:45:04.300 --> 00:45:07.600
hours which some people do or they need to develop a


912
00:45:07.600 --> 00:45:10.400
career that will support, you know, the different things


913
00:45:10.400 --> 00:45:13.400
that they want to do that has some element of service


914
00:45:13.400 --> 00:45:13.900
involved.


915
00:45:15.100 --> 00:45:18.300
So that's how you handle that square that I did that really quickly but


916
00:45:18.300 --> 00:45:21.200
that's transmuting that energy it's use that square to build.


917
00:45:22.100 --> 00:45:25.700
Realize that this doesn't have to be a problem if they don't transmute


918
00:45:25.700 --> 00:45:26.100
the energy.


919
00:45:27.100 --> 00:45:30.200
Then this means they always want to they constantly want to


920
00:45:30.200 --> 00:45:34.800
and they try their darndest to go travel and


921
00:45:33.800 --> 00:45:36.800
do it, but they have to make compromises because


922
00:45:36.800 --> 00:45:40.200
of the square and they probably don't have this could


923
00:45:39.200 --> 00:45:42.400
end up turning into because of this Square


924
00:45:42.400 --> 00:45:45.100
arguments. That's how it


925
00:45:45.100 --> 00:45:48.300
would normally play out is Mars squaring the


926
00:45:48.300 --> 00:45:51.600
part of Fortune could be that they argue with their partner over money.


927
00:45:52.400 --> 00:45:55.100
When it has to do a traveling, how do I


928
00:45:55.100 --> 00:45:58.800
not argue with my partner over money? I make


929
00:45:58.800 --> 00:45:59.300
more money.


930
00:46:00.600 --> 00:46:03.100
And then we take that steps further and we say how do we


931
00:46:03.100 --> 00:46:07.300
make more money now? It becomes a travel question into


932
00:46:06.300 --> 00:46:08.600
a career question.


933
00:46:09.500 --> 00:46:12.500
Now some people may say I'm happy at my job. I don't want a


934
00:46:12.500 --> 00:46:12.700
different job.


935
00:46:13.800 --> 00:46:16.200
Than you have to come to compromise here


936
00:46:16.200 --> 00:46:18.900
with the things that you want to do in the things your partner wants to do.


937
00:46:20.300 --> 00:46:23.600
And play it out that way and you have to let your partner you will


938
00:46:23.600 --> 00:46:26.500
let your partner in but you have to let your partner in for the strategy


939
00:46:26.500 --> 00:46:29.800
and let them decide some of the things and your


940
00:46:29.800 --> 00:46:31.600
partner is likely going to want to do things.


941
00:46:34.200 --> 00:46:37.700
Like on a whim and kind of like change Pace. Whereas you if you


942
00:46:37.700 --> 00:46:41.000
Dolores here because mercury in


943
00:46:40.300 --> 00:46:43.300
Taurus is in the tenth house, which is the ruler of


944
00:46:43.300 --> 00:46:46.600
Virgo and also Gemini is


945
00:46:46.600 --> 00:46:49.400
over here in the ninth house. This person may want to plan a


946
00:46:49.400 --> 00:46:52.200
bit more. So it's like there's a lot of spontaneity but there's


947
00:46:52.200 --> 00:46:55.100
a little bit of planning. So there's going to be compromised that needs to


948
00:46:55.100 --> 00:46:58.100
happen with this as well. So to travel they can do


949
00:46:58.100 --> 00:47:01.600
it but to be able to do it. This is where they transmute


950
00:47:01.600 --> 00:47:04.300
the energy. I don't want to fight with my partner. I don't want to not


951
00:47:04.300 --> 00:47:07.200
be able to go because everything is too expensive. So, how can I do this?


952
00:47:07.200 --> 00:47:10.600
Well, me and my partner should start a business something online


953
00:47:10.600 --> 00:47:11.100
something.


954
00:47:12.100 --> 00:47:16.900
Where we're uncovering something using other people's assets because


955
00:47:15.900 --> 00:47:18.200
the Moon is here.


956
00:47:20.100 --> 00:47:23.800
Pluto is in Libra. It's in the third house. It's sales. We're


957
00:47:23.800 --> 00:47:26.400
selling something publicly or selling something


958
00:47:26.400 --> 00:47:29.400
through communication. And then that Venus


959
00:47:29.400 --> 00:47:32.400
is back up here something that's either cultural something that we


960
00:47:32.400 --> 00:47:35.500
learned something that has


961
00:47:35.500 --> 00:47:38.000
to do with I said cultural learning.


962
00:47:40.600 --> 00:47:43.400
Or something that's like publishing right? So this could


963
00:47:43.400 --> 00:47:47.400
be that they write could be that they write self-help


964
00:47:46.400 --> 00:47:47.500
books.


965
00:47:48.200 --> 00:47:49.100
Because we took that here.


966
00:47:50.800 --> 00:47:53.300
Or even you know cultural recipes and stuff


967
00:47:53.300 --> 00:47:56.300
like that. There's a lot of things because culture is a huge part of this person right


968
00:47:56.300 --> 00:47:58.000
here. Anyway Jupiter only ascendant.


969
00:47:58.500 --> 00:48:01.100
So, like I said, we're all pulling it all together


970
00:48:01.100 --> 00:48:04.800
and then we would also look at the partners chart to see what they


971
00:48:04.800 --> 00:48:07.400
have going on so that we can transmute that energy here.


972
00:48:07.400 --> 00:48:10.700
So that's the traveling question. And that's a good example of


973
00:48:10.700 --> 00:48:13.200
how one question can actually lead to another area of


974
00:48:13.200 --> 00:48:16.700
life that we have to amend because of the squares here and this


975
00:48:16.700 --> 00:48:19.900
strategy here, especially with an online business strategy


976
00:48:19.900 --> 00:48:22.400
that has to do with either nurturing or


977
00:48:22.400 --> 00:48:25.700
things that are home and you could actually be online


978
00:48:25.700 --> 00:48:26.900
home sales as well.


979
00:48:28.400 --> 00:48:31.500
Especially ones that are far removed


980
00:48:31.500 --> 00:48:34.200
or remote or ones that are harder to sell they could


981
00:48:34.200 --> 00:48:35.200
end up doing that as well.


982
00:48:36.100 --> 00:48:39.500
That was really cool. I got 85 to 90% of that. Awesome. Well,


983
00:48:39.500 --> 00:48:42.600
that's that's good. That's good. So it


984
00:48:42.600 --> 00:48:45.500
you know, you link everything again again, you use all the all


985
00:48:45.500 --> 00:48:46.100
the techniques.


986
00:48:46.900 --> 00:48:49.700
And the information from the previous classes to


987
00:48:49.700 --> 00:48:52.400
do this because we know how to read the chart now. We


988
00:48:52.400 --> 00:48:55.800
want to we want to use it in a different way. We know that Mars


989
00:48:55.800 --> 00:48:58.500
means a bunch of things. It means action. It


990
00:48:58.500 --> 00:49:01.600
means passion. It means drive. It means the physical


991
00:49:01.600 --> 00:49:02.000
body.


992
00:49:03.100 --> 00:49:07.000
It means Adventure. It means pioneering. It means the boss. It


993
00:49:06.300 --> 00:49:09.700
means Brash and reactionary. It


994
00:49:09.700 --> 00:49:10.600
also means anger.


995
00:49:11.300 --> 00:49:14.900
Right. So we have this whole roster of


996
00:49:14.900 --> 00:49:17.700
terms that each one of these planets means and really


997
00:49:17.700 --> 00:49:20.300
what you're doing is you're almost doing an ad


998
00:49:20.300 --> 00:49:22.600
libs kind of thing or a


999
00:49:24.200 --> 00:49:27.400
Like this chart like I fill in this I want this here's


1000
00:49:27.400 --> 00:49:30.300
the planet that I have to work with and here's all my words. I Circle the


1001
00:49:30.300 --> 00:49:33.400
one I want and then I go to the other planets involved in


1002
00:49:33.400 --> 00:49:36.500
this circle and then, you know, I deal with the aspects and that's


1003
00:49:36.500 --> 00:49:39.500
what you're what I'm doing in my head when I'm saying. Oh you can manifest


1004
00:49:39.500 --> 00:49:40.400
you can do this you can do this.


1005
00:49:42.600 --> 00:49:45.300
We talked also a little bit about this person starting their own business


1006
00:49:45.300 --> 00:49:48.600
because seventh house even though people fight


1007
00:49:48.600 --> 00:49:52.200
me on this. I don't know why seventh house is libra-driven Libra


1008
00:49:51.200 --> 00:49:54.100
is relationships, but is also


1009
00:49:54.100 --> 00:49:58.200
legal matters and seventh house is also partnership. Well,


1010
00:49:57.200 --> 00:50:00.200
what's a legal partnership right? It's


1011
00:50:00.200 --> 00:50:01.200
you in the government.


1012
00:50:03.300 --> 00:50:06.200
Forming a contract creates your business and that's


1013
00:50:06.200 --> 00:50:09.500
why the seventh house rules your business. So you can use


1014
00:50:09.500 --> 00:50:12.400
this same energy here which we kind of did in that in


1015
00:50:12.400 --> 00:50:15.200
that travel reading to say, how can we start our own business to do


1016
00:50:15.200 --> 00:50:18.500
something on our own which can also lead us into career and money which is


1017
00:50:18.500 --> 00:50:21.300
a different question, but it


1018
00:50:21.300 --> 00:50:24.100
kind of coattails or pigeon to when is it


1019
00:50:24.100 --> 00:50:27.600
code dovetails? I think that's the word off of


1020
00:50:27.600 --> 00:50:30.600
the last thing Taylor says I see


1021
00:50:30.600 --> 00:50:33.000
that Pluto sex tiles.


1022
00:50:34.400 --> 00:50:37.200
Neptune sure does so yeah you would


1023
00:50:37.200 --> 00:50:40.900
take all this and you would bring this back in here so vacation


1024
00:50:40.900 --> 00:50:43.200
stuff vacation rentals would also be


1025
00:50:43.200 --> 00:50:44.900
another thing for sales if it's real estate.


1026
00:50:47.600 --> 00:50:49.700
Does that mean this person can choose?


1027
00:50:50.700 --> 00:50:53.400
To communicate in a certain way to help


1028
00:50:53.400 --> 00:50:57.300
with their stage presence. Okay. So back to film when


1029
00:50:56.300 --> 00:50:59.500
we go here the rulership of


1030
00:50:59.500 --> 00:51:02.700
all this stage presence their power is within their communication,


1031
00:51:02.700 --> 00:51:06.300
especially when they're in dialogue right anything. That's


1032
00:51:06.300 --> 00:51:07.100
like I'm here or


1033
00:51:08.400 --> 00:51:11.300
If the person's doing a monologue, and I'm going to answer the


1034
00:51:11.300 --> 00:51:13.000
full question, but someone's doing a monologue.


1035
00:51:13.800 --> 00:51:16.400
And we have Libra energy. Then we have to get artsy with


1036
00:51:16.400 --> 00:51:19.400
it. We have to use the art side of Libra here


1037
00:51:19.400 --> 00:51:23.400
and kind of create this like Poetic delivery


1038
00:51:22.400 --> 00:51:25.500
and that will alleviate some of


1039
00:51:25.500 --> 00:51:28.400
the issues that they could come with Stage presence here. Now again,


1040
00:51:28.400 --> 00:51:31.700
like you said, there's a sextile here which brings


1041
00:51:31.700 --> 00:51:32.000
in


1042
00:51:34.700 --> 00:51:37.400
this energy from the fifth house. Now all of this fifth house


1043
00:51:37.400 --> 00:51:38.400
energy here is


1044
00:51:39.600 --> 00:51:42.900
A fantasy it's fantasy storytelling as


1045
00:51:42.900 --> 00:51:45.400
something that is fun. And because it is it's


1046
00:51:45.400 --> 00:51:48.100
rulers in the first house. This also brings me back to somebody


1047
00:51:48.100 --> 00:51:51.600
who would be inclined to be an actor or somebody


1048
00:51:51.600 --> 00:51:52.900
involved in film.


1049
00:52:00.400 --> 00:52:01.500
They could even be a director.


1050
00:52:02.600 --> 00:52:05.300
Because the 12th house ruler is part of


1051
00:52:05.300 --> 00:52:05.900
this as well.


1052
00:52:06.800 --> 00:52:09.600
So we kind of pull all this energy together in


1053
00:52:09.600 --> 00:52:12.300
Pluto sex tile Neptune is going to bring in that


1054
00:52:12.300 --> 00:52:17.100
ability to tap into that creative flavor


1055
00:52:15.100 --> 00:52:17.200
that


1056
00:52:18.600 --> 00:52:18.800
that


1057
00:52:20.500 --> 00:52:23.900
the Neptune is like comes from God right comes


1058
00:52:23.900 --> 00:52:26.500
from the universe comes to God, you're a conduit everything


1059
00:52:26.500 --> 00:52:29.600
that Neptune has to do with has nothing to do with you on


1060
00:52:29.600 --> 00:52:32.300
a tangible level is everything that's illusionaries everything


1061
00:52:32.300 --> 00:52:33.200
that's intangible.


1062
00:52:33.900 --> 00:52:34.100
so


1063
00:52:35.900 --> 00:52:39.600
Pluto and Neptune sextile


1064
00:52:38.600 --> 00:52:41.400
each other you have the ability to tap


1065
00:52:41.400 --> 00:52:45.400
into that energy to pull in again


1066
00:52:44.400 --> 00:52:47.400
everything just flowing through you. So


1067
00:52:47.400 --> 00:52:50.500
if this person surrenders, right we're talking about stage fright,


1068
00:52:50.500 --> 00:52:53.600
we're talking about communication if they surrender into the art


1069
00:52:53.600 --> 00:52:56.500
and the creative expression of it. It'll alleviate this


1070
00:52:56.500 --> 00:52:59.500
as well and they have to choose to do that because a sextile


1071
00:52:59.500 --> 00:53:02.200
is a choice. It's not automatic but it


1072
00:53:02.200 --> 00:53:05.100
is linked and it is there for them. So if they do that, yes, they


1073
00:53:05.100 --> 00:53:08.700
can do that to help with their stage presence and


1074
00:53:08.700 --> 00:53:11.900
because it's Jupiter they're already in a


1075
00:53:11.900 --> 00:53:14.100
predisposition to be Larger than


1076
00:53:14.100 --> 00:53:17.300
Life. They're a Leo rising and a Jupiter in the first House


1077
00:53:17.300 --> 00:53:20.800
Jupiter has Neptune in it. This is a huge stage performer.


1078
00:53:21.700 --> 00:53:24.200
It's could be film. It could also be


1079
00:53:24.200 --> 00:53:27.400
theater this person might actually Excel because especially with


1080
00:53:27.400 --> 00:53:30.100
this here things changing all the time


1081
00:53:30.100 --> 00:53:33.500
and the Moon being here in Scorpio. This person could


1082
00:53:33.500 --> 00:53:36.100
be a theater person as opposed to


1083
00:53:36.100 --> 00:53:39.200
a film person with this type of energy all here


1084
00:53:39.200 --> 00:53:42.800
and they're communication their power comes from their their


1085
00:53:42.800 --> 00:53:45.300
voice. They can manipulate from their


1086
00:53:45.300 --> 00:53:49.000
voice. They can draw that because


1087
00:53:48.200 --> 00:53:51.700
it's connected to the communication. They can


1088
00:53:51.700 --> 00:53:54.500
really, you know, bring deep down and like


1089
00:53:54.500 --> 00:53:57.400
project it'd be something that they could easily


1090
00:53:57.400 --> 00:54:00.700
do 16 over here to 22 just


1091
00:54:00.700 --> 00:54:02.400
a little too wide so


1092
00:54:03.500 --> 00:54:06.300
There's no opposition here, but they can actually, you know have


1093
00:54:06.300 --> 00:54:10.000
that power and then they can tap into this like just amazing creative


1094
00:54:09.600 --> 00:54:12.500
performance. So yes that answer to


1095
00:54:12.500 --> 00:54:13.100
that question is yes.


1096
00:54:13.600 --> 00:54:16.300
If we were to look at dolores's relationships.


1097
00:54:17.100 --> 00:54:18.000
delirious


1098
00:54:19.100 --> 00:54:20.400
her seventh house ruler


1099
00:54:21.100 --> 00:54:24.000
Is conjunct the moon opposing the sun in the


1100
00:54:24.500 --> 00:54:27.700
tenth house, correct? I see that as the relationships may


1101
00:54:27.700 --> 00:54:28.900
have the tendency to be public.


1102
00:54:30.300 --> 00:54:33.400
But there may be some fears about it being public because it may


1103
00:54:33.400 --> 00:54:36.100
change the emotional connection. This is my deepest shot


1104
00:54:36.100 --> 00:54:39.400
at interpretation so far. That's really good. That's really


1105
00:54:39.400 --> 00:54:43.400
good. We have to add to that but that's a good basis. There's a


1106
00:54:43.400 --> 00:54:46.300
connection here with Uranus. So without looking at the


1107
00:54:46.300 --> 00:54:49.300
fact that that's the seventh house there has to be in a very


1108
00:54:49.300 --> 00:54:51.100
deep emotional bond.


1109
00:54:52.200 --> 00:54:55.100
Here Scorpio, very deep emotional bond as a


1110
00:54:55.100 --> 00:54:55.800
friend.


1111
00:54:57.100 --> 00:55:01.300
That allows for emotional Independence


1112
00:55:00.300 --> 00:55:03.500
and freedom within their relationship


1113
00:55:03.500 --> 00:55:06.500
and there's a strategy that comes along


1114
00:55:06.500 --> 00:55:09.800
with that that is likely tied to their professional career.


1115
00:55:10.600 --> 00:55:11.800
So the things that you see


1116
00:55:12.800 --> 00:55:15.300
Are chosen sometimes not always


1117
00:55:15.300 --> 00:55:18.900
because of urine is sometimes things slip out, but they


1118
00:55:18.900 --> 00:55:21.200
can choose to to just show the


1119
00:55:21.200 --> 00:55:24.200
tenth house just hide away in the fourth house


1120
00:55:24.200 --> 00:55:27.200
or they can blend it together which will be the natural thing to


1121
00:55:27.200 --> 00:55:31.500
do here to heal their


1122
00:55:30.500 --> 00:55:33.800
Public Image. So that's the transmuting


1123
00:55:33.800 --> 00:55:36.300
part is there their relationships may have actually


1124
00:55:36.300 --> 00:55:39.600
caused them pain when it comes to you know, PR there


1125
00:55:39.600 --> 00:55:42.200
Public Image their reputation things of that


1126
00:55:42.200 --> 00:55:42.400
nature.


1127
00:55:43.200 --> 00:55:45.500
They would have to strategize with their partner.


1128
00:55:46.200 --> 00:55:49.900
To take their friendship and take the eradicism that


1129
00:55:49.900 --> 00:55:52.600
may happen in their home life and balance


1130
00:55:52.600 --> 00:55:56.400
that out with the image. They portray out here as


1131
00:55:55.400 --> 00:55:59.000
you know, especially when it comes to Value it


1132
00:55:58.100 --> 00:56:01.500
comes to the you know, especially her


1133
00:56:01.500 --> 00:56:04.600
because of the Womanhood and it comes to the Arts and


1134
00:56:04.600 --> 00:56:07.700
anything like that and make sure that that they what


1135
00:56:07.700 --> 00:56:08.200
they say.


1136
00:56:09.100 --> 00:56:12.600
It communicates in a way that is healing that


1137
00:56:12.600 --> 00:56:15.500
is making them look good and that they help other


1138
00:56:15.500 --> 00:56:18.300
people in the same Arena because you want


1139
00:56:18.300 --> 00:56:20.200
to use chiron's energy to help others.


1140
00:56:22.900 --> 00:56:24.700
Wow, good job, girl. I know right?


1141
00:56:26.800 --> 00:56:29.500
Or they chosen big wait,


1142
00:56:29.500 --> 00:56:32.900
are they chosen? Because it's an opposition. Are they


1143
00:56:32.900 --> 00:56:33.200
chosen?


1144
00:56:34.200 --> 00:56:38.400
I'm so proud of myself. Yay. Are they


1145
00:56:38.400 --> 00:56:40.900
chosen because it's in opposition you have to


1146
00:56:42.100 --> 00:56:44.700
You have to clarify that.


1147
00:56:45.500 --> 00:56:47.200
Because I'm not sure what that means.


1148
00:56:48.800 --> 00:56:51.700
Oh choosing. Sorry. I got excited. Are


1149
00:56:51.700 --> 00:56:55.300
they choosing because it's an opposition oppositions allow


1150
00:56:54.300 --> 00:56:57.300
you to choose it's kind of like sex


1151
00:56:57.300 --> 00:57:01.000
tiles. The difference is that in opposition has consequences so


1152
00:57:00.100 --> 00:57:03.600
you cannot remain on one


1153
00:57:03.600 --> 00:57:04.100
set of energy.


1154
00:57:05.400 --> 00:57:08.300
You are always tend to bring your home your work life home


1155
00:57:08.300 --> 00:57:11.400
your home life to work finding that balance that


1156
00:57:11.400 --> 00:57:14.200
allows you to kind of keep things secret that you don't want to get out


1157
00:57:14.200 --> 00:57:17.400
versus what you want to put out as the type of like


1158
00:57:17.400 --> 00:57:21.300
nurturing, you know, down-to-earth couple that is


1159
00:57:21.300 --> 00:57:24.200
something that you would have to transmute you'd have to intentionally do that


1160
00:57:24.200 --> 00:57:27.300
because like I said, the energies will play out


1161
00:57:27.300 --> 00:57:30.900
in their lowest vibrational state which means this eradicism and


1162
00:57:30.900 --> 00:57:33.100
these fears and the things that


1163
00:57:33.100 --> 00:57:36.100
go on at home. That could be taboo. Like you


1164
00:57:36.100 --> 00:57:39.900
always go there first because that's usually what ends up happening like taboo Secrets


1165
00:57:39.900 --> 00:57:42.300
cheating all that kind of stuff if you want that to stay.


1166
00:57:42.900 --> 00:57:45.000
Wrapped under wraps. If


1167
00:57:45.200 --> 00:57:48.000
it does happen. Then you have to balance out, you know


1168
00:57:48.300 --> 00:57:51.000
all of this and you have to say you have to use the energy you have


1169
00:57:51.100 --> 00:57:54.300
to say. No, we have a deep bond and like not in a lying sense.


1170
00:57:54.300 --> 00:57:57.200
You have to use it in a in


1171
00:57:57.200 --> 00:58:00.200
you know with Integrity in that type of sense here, but


1172
00:58:00.200 --> 00:58:03.600
you have to balance that out here because you don't want or you can


1173
00:58:03.600 --> 00:58:06.400
use it in a different way. You can say hey, we're not perfect


1174
00:58:06.400 --> 00:58:09.100
right? That's what I would do if this or my


1175
00:58:09.100 --> 00:58:12.000
energy, we're not perfect. We're not the staple people here.


1176
00:58:12.900 --> 00:58:15.200
We live our life we do what we want to


1177
00:58:15.200 --> 00:58:18.200
do. We do it in our own way. And yeah, we have these


1178
00:58:18.200 --> 00:58:21.400
issues. We work through it. We're balanced. We have our home life


1179
00:58:21.400 --> 00:58:24.400
here and we are healing and we are


1180
00:58:24.400 --> 00:58:28.000
exp. We are expressing this and sharing our experience


1181
00:58:27.100 --> 00:58:30.200
with this especially with this Square. I would


1182
00:58:30.200 --> 00:58:33.100
use that to use the energy as opposed to


1183
00:58:33.100 --> 00:58:37.200
a being a problem that that brings you down use that


1184
00:58:37.200 --> 00:58:39.200
as motivation as


1185
00:58:41.300 --> 00:58:44.300
You know as part of who you are is to embrace


1186
00:58:44.300 --> 00:58:47.300
that in even in the public and the public will because of


1187
00:58:47.300 --> 00:58:50.900
the square some people will obviously try to


1188
00:58:50.900 --> 00:58:53.100
make this a bigger thing than it really is because every little


1189
00:58:53.100 --> 00:58:56.400
thing will get out and cause agitation here, but if you use it, you


1190
00:58:56.400 --> 00:58:59.900
control the narrative and there's your power here through communication


1191
00:58:59.900 --> 00:59:02.100
communication with others, especially when


1192
00:59:02.100 --> 00:59:05.500
it comes to the ninth house energies and sex, right? So


1193
00:59:05.500 --> 00:59:08.500
if it's sex related and there's cheating or


1194
00:59:08.500 --> 00:59:11.200
whatnot and you use that you say hey this stuff happened we still


1195
00:59:11.200 --> 00:59:14.100
love each other. There's still Venus and whatnot over here. You know,


1196
00:59:14.100 --> 00:59:17.300
we're mending it. We are working on it. That's actually better for


1197
00:59:17.300 --> 00:59:20.300
this person then not doing that.


1198
00:59:23.900 --> 00:59:26.400
So, how can Angie asks how can


1199
00:59:26.400 --> 00:59:29.500
Dolores use the power of Pluto as opposed


1200
00:59:29.500 --> 00:59:32.900
to chaos in this chart? Well that was part of it. So what


1201
00:59:32.900 --> 00:59:35.300
I just said is that they're they're


1202
00:59:35.300 --> 00:59:39.200
actually harnessing that communication when


1203
00:59:38.200 --> 00:59:41.400
it comes to how they speak with the public and


1204
00:59:41.400 --> 00:59:44.200
how they kind of put their image and their identity out. They actually


1205
00:59:44.200 --> 00:59:47.800
connect to their identity and know who they are and identify


1206
00:59:47.800 --> 00:59:50.300
with this home. So Pluto is is all


1207
00:59:50.300 --> 00:59:53.100
the things that Pluto is but it's also the ruler in this


1208
00:59:53.100 --> 00:59:56.500
case of the fourth house. So everything that's going on with the fourth house the opposition


1209
00:59:56.500 --> 00:59:59.600
and then because mercury in


1210
00:59:59.600 --> 01:00:01.000
the 10th is squaring off with


1211
01:00:03.400 --> 01:00:06.400
Jupiter which is the ruler is the Sun


1212
01:00:06.400 --> 01:00:09.500
and that's part of the opposition this whole thing is like this


1213
01:00:09.500 --> 01:00:12.400
is an interesting person somebody who


1214
01:00:12.400 --> 01:00:15.400
would be in the tabloids. Probably pretty consistently even


1215
01:00:15.400 --> 01:00:16.400
though they might not want to


1216
01:00:17.800 --> 01:00:20.400
but this type of energy here Pluto at


1217
01:00:20.400 --> 01:00:23.400
16 degrees is not really affecting much of


1218
01:00:23.400 --> 01:00:26.800
anything aside from an agitation here. So


1219
01:00:26.800 --> 01:00:29.500
that's really good to know too is that we have a sex tile


1220
01:00:29.500 --> 01:00:32.100
between Pluto and Neptune which


1221
01:00:32.100 --> 01:00:35.400
we've talked about and using that power to construct a


1222
01:00:35.400 --> 01:00:39.200
narrative especially when it comes to entertainment. It comes to their happiness


1223
01:00:38.200 --> 01:00:42.000
and how they can control the communication


1224
01:00:41.700 --> 01:00:44.500
with their partner and their and the


1225
01:00:44.500 --> 01:00:47.200
public to bring in their own


1226
01:00:47.200 --> 01:00:51.000
happiness or their utopian, like what they would want to


1227
01:00:50.300 --> 01:00:51.900
feel happy here.


1228
01:00:52.900 --> 01:00:55.300
And that's all connected to the first house as well.


1229
01:00:55.300 --> 01:00:59.100
And then the agitation that goes to the moon and Uranus


1230
01:00:58.100 --> 01:01:01.900
right Pluto and Uranus. Yeah. So


1231
01:01:01.900 --> 01:01:04.700
the agitation that comes to this conjunction and then over we


1232
01:01:04.700 --> 01:01:07.300
have to work backwards. So we have to say what is it over


1233
01:01:07.300 --> 01:01:10.300
here? Because this is connected to the first house


1234
01:01:10.300 --> 01:01:13.100
with Jupiter in the ascendant here. How can I


1235
01:01:13.100 --> 01:01:16.300
and this is just in the sense of communication with career right


1236
01:01:16.300 --> 01:01:19.400
that the lens we have to look through everything through a lot lens. So


1237
01:01:19.400 --> 01:01:22.200
romance will be a different lens because the fifth house is also


1238
01:01:22.200 --> 01:01:26.700
that but we would have to say in order to appease this what


1239
01:01:25.700 --> 01:01:28.600
do we have to do with this to a


1240
01:01:28.600 --> 01:01:31.400
piece this how is this going to make this happy because


1241
01:01:31.400 --> 01:01:34.300
although in it's normal state is


1242
01:01:34.300 --> 01:01:37.700
going to be the lack of Romance. I'm


1243
01:01:37.700 --> 01:01:40.600
gonna bring that in but the lack of romance could be an agitation


1244
01:01:40.600 --> 01:01:43.100
to the friendship which is being portrayed in


1245
01:01:43.100 --> 01:01:46.100
the public and then this person has to have a


1246
01:01:46.100 --> 01:01:49.600
deep conversation that involves intimacy dealing with


1247
01:01:49.600 --> 01:01:50.000
all this


1248
01:01:51.300 --> 01:01:54.400
But they may not enjoy the intimacy with their partner because it


1249
01:01:54.400 --> 01:01:57.000
opposes their work life and whatnot. So in order


1250
01:01:57.100 --> 01:02:00.400
to bring all of this together, they have to say Okay for the fifth


1251
01:02:00.400 --> 01:02:03.000
house and work backwards for the fifth house. I have to


1252
01:02:03.200 --> 01:02:06.300
go into this opposition. So we resolved the opposition. We know the


1253
01:02:06.300 --> 01:02:09.000
work-life balance. We know the pr we know the healing that needs to


1254
01:02:09.100 --> 01:02:12.300
be done and we look here. What is my utopian dream? What


1255
01:02:12.300 --> 01:02:15.200
are all the Illusions? I don't want to work with illusion. I want to


1256
01:02:15.200 --> 01:02:18.100
know it's there but I don't want to work with it. It's a low vibration. So instead of


1257
01:02:18.100 --> 01:02:21.900
Illusions. I want Utopia. I want you know,


1258
01:02:21.900 --> 01:02:24.400
you know positive things going on more of


1259
01:02:24.400 --> 01:02:28.000
a spiritual Essence. So how can I have a spiritual Essence within


1260
01:02:27.200 --> 01:02:30.200
my romance assuming that


1261
01:02:30.200 --> 01:02:33.500
that's what we're talking about as opposed to Career spiritual Essence


1262
01:02:33.500 --> 01:02:37.100
in My Romance. How do I make that happen through


1263
01:02:36.100 --> 01:02:37.400
this?


1264
01:02:38.600 --> 01:02:41.400
All right. So in order to bring this this together,


1265
01:02:41.400 --> 01:02:44.900
we have to say, you know, we have


1266
01:02:44.900 --> 01:02:47.400
to develop this like cultural spiritual or


1267
01:02:47.400 --> 01:02:50.900
potentially religious type of romance


1268
01:02:50.900 --> 01:02:53.100
like this connection here that is going to


1269
01:02:53.100 --> 01:02:56.100
lead to this friendship and this


1270
01:02:56.100 --> 01:02:59.300
deep bomb which is going to lead to your identity and that's all going


1271
01:02:59.300 --> 01:03:02.300
to be kind of move forward. And then once we work backwards to


1272
01:03:02.300 --> 01:03:05.800
get back to Pluto then we Embrace this as our identity


1273
01:03:05.800 --> 01:03:08.600
and we say I control this through my


1274
01:03:08.600 --> 01:03:11.500
communication with my partner. So this person


1275
01:03:11.500 --> 01:03:14.300
Dolores unless the partner has the same type


1276
01:03:14.300 --> 01:03:17.800
of setup most likely Dolores


1277
01:03:17.800 --> 01:03:20.100
is actually in control of the perception of


1278
01:03:20.100 --> 01:03:23.900
the love life and the romance and the things that are done and


1279
01:03:23.900 --> 01:03:26.400
you know how that affects


1280
01:03:26.400 --> 01:03:29.900
their relationship she actually chooses if


1281
01:03:29.900 --> 01:03:32.700
she's transmuting the energy what her


1282
01:03:32.700 --> 01:03:35.500
ideal romantic setup is here.


1283
01:03:36.600 --> 01:03:40.100
And then she's merging it back in with their work-life


1284
01:03:39.100 --> 01:03:42.600
balance their career and everything like that to get


1285
01:03:42.600 --> 01:03:45.500
what she wants out of that and then she's because it's


1286
01:03:45.500 --> 01:03:48.500
also the ruler the agitation to the ruler we've


1287
01:03:48.500 --> 01:03:51.200
resolved this well by saying, okay. Now this is how I'm


1288
01:03:51.200 --> 01:03:54.500
going to communicate to get what I want to make sure that we keep it all


1289
01:03:54.500 --> 01:03:57.100
in line and she has the power the thing is


1290
01:03:57.100 --> 01:04:00.800
it's not Authority it's power. She has the magnetism and


1291
01:04:00.800 --> 01:04:03.300
the ability to manipulate through communication to


1292
01:04:03.300 --> 01:04:04.800
her partner into others.


1293
01:04:05.400 --> 01:04:07.400
So she is in control of this relationship.


1294
01:04:08.300 --> 01:04:11.400
But she has to know it if she doesn't feel in control of the


1295
01:04:11.400 --> 01:04:13.100
relationship. She doesn't feel the power.


1296
01:04:13.900 --> 01:04:16.200
It becomes chaos, and then she ends


1297
01:04:16.200 --> 01:04:19.400
up with this rage as part of her identity here that


1298
01:04:19.400 --> 01:04:22.300
can come and go because it's in the urine a second it can


1299
01:04:22.300 --> 01:04:23.400
come and go in a whim.


1300
01:04:24.300 --> 01:04:27.700
And she can just have these outbursts and then those outbursts create


1301
01:04:27.700 --> 01:04:30.300
the agitation that ends up getting spread up


1302
01:04:30.300 --> 01:04:32.200
and then kills the romance.


1303
01:04:33.100 --> 01:04:36.900
I said that weird but kills the romance in the in the in


1304
01:04:36.900 --> 01:04:39.400
the relationship. So to avoid that happening


1305
01:04:39.400 --> 01:04:40.800
we transmute the energy.


1306
01:04:41.800 --> 01:04:42.600
This is what I want.


1307
01:04:43.400 --> 01:04:46.700
You know, I got these three they're all connected. And the last


1308
01:04:46.700 --> 01:04:49.800
one is connected to me as a person. So I


1309
01:04:49.800 --> 01:04:52.100
have to know what it is. I want here and I


1310
01:04:52.100 --> 01:04:55.400
don't have much else to work with in terms of what is connected.


1311
01:04:55.400 --> 01:04:59.500
I will say though that all of this I for


1312
01:04:59.500 --> 01:05:02.900
the sake of something told me intuitively before


1313
01:05:02.900 --> 01:05:05.300
I hit record and like Came


1314
01:05:05.300 --> 01:05:06.400
live on this call here.


1315
01:05:07.200 --> 01:05:09.000
to pull up Pharma


1316
01:05:09.700 --> 01:05:13.300
you see Fama up here in the


1317
01:05:13.300 --> 01:05:16.500
Eighth House in Pisces.


1318
01:05:17.300 --> 01:05:20.200
It's interesting because everything we've talked about here involves.


1319
01:05:21.500 --> 01:05:24.500
You know the home life in the the secrets in


1320
01:05:24.500 --> 01:05:27.500
the potential cheating in the taboo lifestyle in


1321
01:05:27.500 --> 01:05:30.900
the potential alternative type


1322
01:05:30.900 --> 01:05:33.300
of relationship that this person has and there's


1323
01:05:33.300 --> 01:05:36.400
a strategy behind it. Like it's it's meant to boost the


1324
01:05:36.400 --> 01:05:39.700
career and they're using it and they're using these slight agitations in


1325
01:05:39.700 --> 01:05:42.500
their favor. And what's interesting to me. Is that Fama at


1326
01:05:42.500 --> 01:05:44.600
17 degrees, which is the asteroid of Fame.


1327
01:05:45.300 --> 01:05:48.200
Since we're talking about a person who and again I


1328
01:05:48.200 --> 01:05:51.500
swear to you. I just randomly picked these numbers and


1329
01:05:51.500 --> 01:05:54.400
created Dolores. I have no idea if this could


1330
01:05:54.400 --> 01:05:55.900
be a person or whatever but


1331
01:05:56.900 --> 01:05:59.200
It is squaring against Neptune. So it's squaring


1332
01:05:59.200 --> 01:06:02.900
against its ruler in Sagittarius. So this actually creates


1333
01:06:02.900 --> 01:06:05.400
a publicized image of the


1334
01:06:05.400 --> 01:06:08.400
secrets, right? This literally is a tabloid person. They are


1335
01:06:08.400 --> 01:06:11.400
known for you know, anything that's film


1336
01:06:11.400 --> 01:06:14.300
Secrets anything that is taboo. That


1337
01:06:14.300 --> 01:06:17.600
is like kind of dramatized. They are


1338
01:06:17.600 --> 01:06:20.400
known for those things and then the sun creates


1339
01:06:20.400 --> 01:06:23.300
a sex tile and it helps it actually helps or can


1340
01:06:23.300 --> 01:06:26.700
help because the sex tile the Public Image that they


1341
01:06:26.700 --> 01:06:29.900
want to portray as a woman because women


1342
01:06:29.900 --> 01:06:30.900
Taurus rules women.


1343
01:06:31.500 --> 01:06:34.400
and then that all spills back into the ninth house again of being


1344
01:06:34.400 --> 01:06:37.500
publicized travel internationally known


1345
01:06:37.500 --> 01:06:41.000
and sex is actually sex


1346
01:06:40.300 --> 01:06:41.600
and like


1347
01:06:43.200 --> 01:06:43.400
like


1348
01:06:44.400 --> 01:06:47.400
I mean you could look at the spiritual and go to a cult but sex and


1349
01:06:47.400 --> 01:06:47.700
like


1350
01:06:49.500 --> 01:06:52.300
You know that that the word emojis pop into


1351
01:06:52.300 --> 01:06:55.900
my head but like that more like risque that's a better word kind of


1352
01:06:55.900 --> 01:06:58.600
like sex appeal and that magnetism could really


1353
01:06:58.600 --> 01:07:01.100
boost this person's career up there.


1354
01:07:02.200 --> 01:07:05.600
As long as they are using Chiron effectively it can


1355
01:07:05.600 --> 01:07:08.300
damage this person's career. If they don't lean into it


1356
01:07:08.300 --> 01:07:11.600
and realize they could be helping other women who feel the same way who don't


1357
01:07:11.600 --> 01:07:14.600
want to give up their identity and their individuality because


1358
01:07:14.600 --> 01:07:17.600
this person's individual individuality is


1359
01:07:17.600 --> 01:07:20.700
based off of having their own private life


1360
01:07:20.700 --> 01:07:23.500
be their private life and


1361
01:07:23.500 --> 01:07:26.300
be secret, right so they need


1362
01:07:26.300 --> 01:07:27.600
to control that chaos.


1363
01:07:28.900 --> 01:07:31.300
Is very deep interesting reading we've


1364
01:07:31.300 --> 01:07:32.100
gotten into here.


1365
01:07:36.400 --> 01:07:39.800
So do you I hope that was clear that


1366
01:07:39.800 --> 01:07:42.200
you can see how I was saying how


1367
01:07:42.200 --> 01:07:46.100
it probably would play out. But what they would have to do to make


1368
01:07:45.100 --> 01:07:48.500
it play out in the way that they want


1369
01:07:48.500 --> 01:07:49.100
it to play out.


1370
01:07:49.900 --> 01:07:52.600
And we do have Saturn here which is hard work


1371
01:07:52.600 --> 01:07:55.500
and you know daily work here and whatnot that


1372
01:07:55.500 --> 01:07:58.400
has to do with how they make their their money. And that


1373
01:07:58.400 --> 01:08:01.200
is all tied into their career and their


1374
01:08:01.200 --> 01:08:04.200
public Persona. Again. Chiron has to


1375
01:08:04.200 --> 01:08:08.100
be used would I say before Chiron Moon Neptune


1376
01:08:07.100 --> 01:08:10.500
Pluto sun and the Sun is extremely


1377
01:08:10.500 --> 01:08:13.200
important. The sun is your happiness and vitality and this one


1378
01:08:13.200 --> 01:08:16.700
balances out between here. This


1379
01:08:16.700 --> 01:08:19.500
person is very prone potentially prone


1380
01:08:19.500 --> 01:08:22.500
to feeling like an outsider, right? So


1381
01:08:22.500 --> 01:08:22.800
this person


1382
01:08:24.900 --> 01:08:28.500
This person here because of son opposite this


1383
01:08:28.500 --> 01:08:31.500
conjunction here can feel like they they don't belong


1384
01:08:31.500 --> 01:08:34.100
in society and that they want to seclude in.


1385
01:08:36.500 --> 01:08:39.700
Basically hide away from the rest of society here


1386
01:08:39.700 --> 01:08:40.900
because of this opposition.


1387
01:08:41.900 --> 01:08:44.200
At the same time, you know, they may feel


1388
01:08:44.200 --> 01:08:47.300
like sometimes they have friends. Sometimes they don't oppositions kind


1389
01:08:47.300 --> 01:08:48.300
of teeter-taught or sometimes.


1390
01:08:49.400 --> 01:08:52.400
So in order for this person, they also are a rebel


1391
01:08:52.400 --> 01:08:55.700
they are a natural Rebel and you know


1392
01:08:55.700 --> 01:08:58.400
their spiritual Rebel they're Revel in film. They're


1393
01:08:58.400 --> 01:09:01.300
Rebel in anything that's 12th house related because of the moon but also


1394
01:09:01.300 --> 01:09:04.000
their emotions they are deeply tied in


1395
01:09:05.300 --> 01:09:08.400
To being a rebel and if they don't lean into the rebel status,


1396
01:09:08.400 --> 01:09:12.000
they will feel like they don't belong in society. Now, you know,


1397
01:09:11.200 --> 01:09:14.100
they can either feel like they are doing their own


1398
01:09:14.100 --> 01:09:17.100
thing. They're unique and individual or they can feel like they don't


1399
01:09:17.100 --> 01:09:20.400
belong in society and it can be very depressing for them. And that's


1400
01:09:20.400 --> 01:09:23.400
why it's extremely important to understand how to transmute energy


1401
01:09:23.400 --> 01:09:26.600
because you don't want to be depressed. We have


1402
01:09:26.600 --> 01:09:30.300
the Sun Also Queen kunk's Neptune


1403
01:09:29.300 --> 01:09:32.300
over here. So finding your


1404
01:09:32.300 --> 01:09:36.000
happiness within Neptune and


1405
01:09:35.100 --> 01:09:38.600
type things can be very difficult as well and bringing


1406
01:09:38.600 --> 01:09:42.100
that stage performance into your public Persona


1407
01:09:41.100 --> 01:09:44.800
in the way that you want to can also feel different.


1408
01:09:44.800 --> 01:09:48.500
You can feel like the what you're known for isn't


1409
01:09:47.500 --> 01:09:50.400
doesn't really match like your spiritual Vibe


1410
01:09:50.400 --> 01:09:52.500
or your storytelling or your creative expression.


1411
01:09:53.300 --> 01:09:54.500
You're known for other things.


1412
01:09:55.600 --> 01:09:58.400
And if you understand that Quincy can


1413
01:09:58.400 --> 01:10:01.900
lean into it she can be known for both because it's


1414
01:10:01.900 --> 01:10:05.900
the eighth house, but she's going to be known more for the


1415
01:10:04.900 --> 01:10:07.400
Scorpio type stuff than the


1416
01:10:07.400 --> 01:10:08.700
Neptune type stuff.


1417
01:10:13.500 --> 01:10:16.200
Where do you find Pharma on asteroid? Don't


1418
01:10:16.200 --> 01:10:19.300
see it. Most things on Astro are


1419
01:10:19.300 --> 01:10:22.300
codes. So when you go to


1420
01:10:22.300 --> 01:10:23.900
should just show you.


1421
01:10:25.200 --> 01:10:28.200
When you go to extended chart selection and you fill out all your


1422
01:10:28.200 --> 01:10:28.900
stuff at the bottom.


1423
01:10:31.500 --> 01:10:35.200
There's now you can't see it. Of course. Here's what


1424
01:10:35.200 --> 01:10:38.800
I'll do. I'll just move this over the bottom right there is


1425
01:10:38.800 --> 01:10:41.400
h13 which is another


1426
01:10:41.400 --> 01:10:44.700
Lilith. It's the true Lilith as opposed to the average but


1427
01:10:44.700 --> 01:10:48.000
asteroid four zero eight is Fama


1428
01:10:47.500 --> 01:10:50.300
and I just know that because I use Fama a


1429
01:10:50.300 --> 01:10:53.700
lot. There are a bunch of them. There's King. I


1430
01:10:53.700 --> 01:10:56.500
can't remember the number for King but there's King there's


1431
01:10:56.500 --> 01:10:59.300
a whole list of asteroids out there and each one has a significance just


1432
01:10:59.300 --> 01:11:01.400
like the fixed stars have a significance as well.


1433
01:11:02.400 --> 01:11:06.100
The fixed Stars you can actually find right here. It'll load


1434
01:11:05.100 --> 01:11:08.900
them up. There are so many of them but there


1435
01:11:08.900 --> 01:11:11.300
are certain ones like regulus and Sirius and a


1436
01:11:11.300 --> 01:11:14.100
few others that you can use. Each one has a definition. I will


1437
01:11:14.100 --> 01:11:17.300
eventually do a class as well on fixed stars


1438
01:11:17.300 --> 01:11:20.400
on asteroids on Fame because I


1439
01:11:20.400 --> 01:11:23.100
think it's super important. Like I have Fame in my


1440
01:11:23.100 --> 01:11:26.500
chart in a certain thing and it's playing out exactly the way that you


1441
01:11:26.500 --> 01:11:29.500
would think it would play out based off of


1442
01:11:29.500 --> 01:11:32.100
the energies there.


1443
01:11:32.100 --> 01:11:34.100
But this person here also has Fame here.


1444
01:11:35.700 --> 01:11:38.100
In conjunct their Uranus, so


1445
01:11:38.100 --> 01:11:42.100
basically in spite of the things that they're trying to keep secret, it's


1446
01:11:41.100 --> 01:11:44.400
just not going to work like they're going


1447
01:11:44.400 --> 01:11:47.200
to be known for these things. Even though I'm sorry.


1448
01:11:47.200 --> 01:11:48.000
That's a trying.


1449
01:11:48.700 --> 01:11:51.700
This is the in conjunct so Pluto so they're they're


1450
01:11:51.700 --> 01:11:54.500
not going to be known for No One's Gonna really know that they're


1451
01:11:54.500 --> 01:11:57.300
the ones in control of everything that's going on so you


1452
01:11:57.300 --> 01:11:58.900
can use in conjunctions.


1453
01:12:01.500 --> 01:12:04.100
In your favor, if you know how they play out, you know


1454
01:12:04.100 --> 01:12:07.600
that this energy and this energy don't understand each other. So then therefore their


1455
01:12:07.600 --> 01:12:10.200
compartmentalizing you can't integrate them and if


1456
01:12:10.200 --> 01:12:13.500
you over compensate one, it will ruin the


1457
01:12:13.500 --> 01:12:16.200
other one. So instead of overcompensating or in


1458
01:12:16.200 --> 01:12:19.800
Pluto and trying to have that power and control over everything let things


1459
01:12:19.800 --> 01:12:22.600
play out and manipulate as you need


1460
01:12:22.600 --> 01:12:25.100
to and just let Fama take over


1461
01:12:25.100 --> 01:12:28.200
in this this thing here because we've


1462
01:12:28.200 --> 01:12:31.300
got that square. We've got that trying we've got that sex tile so


1463
01:12:31.300 --> 01:12:32.500
if I wanted to be famous,


1464
01:12:33.600 --> 01:12:36.400
That Fame could be hidden and it


1465
01:12:36.400 --> 01:12:39.300
could be hidden because maybe I'm taking all of this or I'm


1466
01:12:39.300 --> 01:12:42.700
not leaning into the square because the square creates that agitation and


1467
01:12:42.700 --> 01:12:44.000
agitation is seen.


1468
01:12:44.900 --> 01:12:47.400
So I need to you know, use this right


1469
01:12:47.400 --> 01:12:49.200
here, which creates a queen kunks here.


1470
01:12:49.800 --> 01:12:52.300
And your manipulating controlling behind the


1471
01:12:52.300 --> 01:12:55.300
scenes to make sure that this is what people see if you


1472
01:12:55.300 --> 01:12:58.800
want to be famous if you don't want to be famous then lean


1473
01:12:58.800 --> 01:12:59.000
into this.


1474
01:13:00.200 --> 01:13:03.200
You know make people think that


1475
01:13:03.200 --> 01:13:06.700
you're a freaking wreck that you have power issues


1476
01:13:06.700 --> 01:13:09.400
that you have no control over anything and


1477
01:13:09.400 --> 01:13:12.300
that you know, your life is you know, whatever hidden and


1478
01:13:12.300 --> 01:13:16.000
you don't have an identity and you don't kind of put it out there and you're


1479
01:13:15.600 --> 01:13:18.200
boring you can lean into this.


1480
01:13:18.200 --> 01:13:21.400
You could not have Fame if that's what you wanted. But this


1481
01:13:21.400 --> 01:13:24.300
person is naturally famous couldn't eat could even be


1482
01:13:24.300 --> 01:13:27.300
born into fame or just experience it in a


1483
01:13:27.300 --> 01:13:30.200
lot in a an earlier part of


1484
01:13:30.200 --> 01:13:30.900
their life as well.


1485
01:13:31.700 --> 01:13:32.400
Which is interesting?


1486
01:13:36.600 --> 01:13:39.900
I just realized I have the same placements as Dolores except


1487
01:13:39.900 --> 01:13:42.800
Neptune outside of the orb of influence my


1488
01:13:42.800 --> 01:13:44.000
Sagittarius Pluto.


1489
01:13:44.800 --> 01:13:47.200
Third house, but this is a


1490
01:13:47.200 --> 01:13:50.500
Libra but yes, Sagittarius pleather semi-sexuals my


1491
01:13:50.500 --> 01:13:51.100
cat Moon.


1492
01:13:52.200 --> 01:13:54.000
Fourth house all I feel I've always tried.


1493
01:13:55.400 --> 01:13:58.400
To find my power through using my voice and to express


1494
01:13:58.400 --> 01:14:01.300
my emotions. But the agitation is that I feel like it doesn't


1495
01:14:01.300 --> 01:14:04.100
come across unless it is super powerful what you need


1496
01:14:04.100 --> 01:14:07.800
to do with this semi-sexile. That's


1497
01:14:07.800 --> 01:14:10.200
here is you need to figure out what it is. So you have


1498
01:14:10.200 --> 01:14:14.300
Sagittarius. I mean you have Capricorn so that that


1499
01:14:13.300 --> 01:14:16.200
strength that you have within your emotions and that


1500
01:14:16.200 --> 01:14:19.600
structure that you have emotional security too


1501
01:14:19.600 --> 01:14:22.700
in that Authority. You have to look obviously to see where Saturn is


1502
01:14:22.700 --> 01:14:26.200
but you need to see how that needs to be appeased the


1503
01:14:25.200 --> 01:14:28.600
power and the control can't just randomly come


1504
01:14:28.600 --> 01:14:30.700
out because it will agitate this.


1505
01:14:31.800 --> 01:14:34.600
You have to do this first see exactly


1506
01:14:34.600 --> 01:14:37.400
how you want this to align and then use your power


1507
01:14:37.400 --> 01:14:40.400
within your voice in your control and your manipulation and your


1508
01:14:40.400 --> 01:14:43.800
your evolution of identity


1509
01:14:43.800 --> 01:14:46.800
to favor, whatever your


1510
01:14:46.800 --> 01:14:49.300
your moon placement and all of its aspects are


1511
01:14:49.300 --> 01:14:52.200
so you have to work backwards in a semi-sex style because


1512
01:14:52.200 --> 01:14:55.300
otherwise if you try to move forward, it just keeps hitting an agitation.


1513
01:14:55.300 --> 01:14:58.500
So in order to not hidden agitation, I need to know why it's


1514
01:14:58.500 --> 01:15:01.800
agitated semi-sex towns are very difficult. Someone asks


1515
01:15:01.800 --> 01:15:02.800
me not that long ago.


1516
01:15:05.500 --> 01:15:09.000
I don't know if I ever answered it but what my what I


1517
01:15:08.100 --> 01:15:11.200
feel, oh they asked what are


1518
01:15:11.200 --> 01:15:11.200
the


1519
01:15:12.400 --> 01:15:16.000
What I was on a life what I think the most difficult placements


1520
01:15:15.200 --> 01:15:18.600
are I don't think placements are difficult. I


1521
01:15:18.600 --> 01:15:20.900
think aspects are difficult certain ones.


1522
01:15:21.900 --> 01:15:24.500
And it's not trying it's not Square. It's not even oppositions.


1523
01:15:24.500 --> 01:15:27.400
It's quintunk's and semi-sex tiles.


1524
01:15:27.400 --> 01:15:30.300
I think that those are the most difficult things to work with


1525
01:15:30.300 --> 01:15:33.200
because it can feel like there's no


1526
01:15:33.200 --> 01:15:36.300
way to fuse those energies together and I know that


1527
01:15:36.300 --> 01:15:39.400
in my chart which I don't mind sharing because


1528
01:15:39.400 --> 01:15:42.200
I've done a few times in this course and you know,


1529
01:15:42.200 --> 01:15:45.300
I just don't care to begin with I used to they used to


1530
01:15:45.300 --> 01:15:48.100
say don't ever share your chart because people have power over you and I'm


1531
01:15:48.100 --> 01:15:50.300
like, no I know more about this than they do.


1532
01:15:51.600 --> 01:15:55.500
Um not ego speaking just tax. I


1533
01:15:54.500 --> 01:15:57.400
had this agitation here between my North Node


1534
01:15:57.400 --> 01:16:00.100
and my ascendant and this crushes me. I can't tell you


1535
01:16:00.100 --> 01:16:03.200
how many times I've you know,


1536
01:16:03.200 --> 01:16:06.200
kind of gotten into astrology and Terror and whatnot where I've got


1537
01:16:06.200 --> 01:16:09.200
like, this is not what I want to do because it doesn't appease this


1538
01:16:09.200 --> 01:16:12.400
and it doesn't appease this and while it actually creates


1539
01:16:12.400 --> 01:16:15.700
the agitation with the communication online and


1540
01:16:15.700 --> 01:16:18.200
then the opposition and the kite like mine's very


1541
01:16:18.200 --> 01:16:19.600
complicated in whatnot, but


1542
01:16:20.600 --> 01:16:22.000
Honestly, it really comes down to this.


1543
01:16:23.100 --> 01:16:26.500
In order for me to fulfill my North Node and not


1544
01:16:26.500 --> 01:16:29.700
create an agitation to my ascendant might literal state


1545
01:16:29.700 --> 01:16:32.600
of being I have to know what it is. I want what are


1546
01:16:32.600 --> 01:16:35.400
the actions I want to do. How do I want to be seen? How


1547
01:16:35.400 --> 01:16:38.500
do I want to communicate? How do I like want


1548
01:16:38.500 --> 01:16:41.100
to do all this before I even figure and then I have to


1549
01:16:41.100 --> 01:16:44.800
go back and say now that I know how I want to be and I've


1550
01:16:44.800 --> 01:16:47.100
transmuted all the energies or I figured out


1551
01:16:47.100 --> 01:16:50.300
how I want all the energies to play out. I go back to this semi sex tile


1552
01:16:50.300 --> 01:16:53.400
and I say in order for me to be a spiritual person who helps


1553
01:16:53.400 --> 01:16:57.400
people who does one-on-one Communication online and


1554
01:16:56.400 --> 01:16:59.300
order for me to enjoy doing it.


1555
01:16:59.300 --> 01:17:03.100
It has to be on my terms regarding everything


1556
01:17:02.100 --> 01:17:03.400
else.


1557
01:17:04.600 --> 01:17:07.100
And it's also film and nurturing and


1558
01:17:07.100 --> 01:17:10.400
having a home and helping other people by having a platform for film


1559
01:17:10.400 --> 01:17:13.300
which an independent film which is what I'm actually doing


1560
01:17:13.300 --> 01:17:15.700
next and the agitation is how do I do it?


1561
01:17:16.600 --> 01:17:19.200
So I have to make that game plan to figure out how it is.


1562
01:17:19.200 --> 01:17:21.200
I actually want to do this in the first place.


1563
01:17:22.100 --> 01:17:23.100
and that's kind of


1564
01:17:24.500 --> 01:17:25.900
that's that semi sextile.


1565
01:17:26.500 --> 01:17:29.400
And then obviously there's also the queen kunks because


1566
01:17:29.400 --> 01:17:32.800
of the semi sextile and nodes are opposite my natural abilities


1567
01:17:32.800 --> 01:17:35.800
and my workaholism has caused me


1568
01:17:35.800 --> 01:17:38.100
to not be able to do some of the things I've wanted to do in my


1569
01:17:38.100 --> 01:17:41.400
life and have fun and like get out and communicate because


1570
01:17:41.400 --> 01:17:44.500
I get so hung up on work finding a way to fuse.


1571
01:17:44.500 --> 01:17:47.100
This has to be done in a creative fashion as well.


1572
01:17:47.100 --> 01:17:50.700
And for a queen kunks because again, it's in order. This


1573
01:17:50.700 --> 01:17:53.600
is the one that needs to be


1574
01:17:53.600 --> 01:17:56.700
addressed instead of diving into work and


1575
01:17:56.700 --> 01:17:58.500
then you know that affecting


1576
01:17:59.400 --> 01:18:02.400
I'm sorry instead of me doing what


1577
01:18:02.400 --> 01:18:05.600
I want and either not being able to dive into work or getting stuck


1578
01:18:05.600 --> 01:18:08.200
over here in work. I have to figure out what it is I even want


1579
01:18:08.200 --> 01:18:11.200
to do and that usually was my problem this I had no idea what I even


1580
01:18:11.200 --> 01:18:14.400
wanted to do. And then once I figured this


1581
01:18:14.400 --> 01:18:17.400
out and how I want to structure my life structure my day


1582
01:18:17.400 --> 01:18:20.200
because it's daily routine structure my health then I went


1583
01:18:20.200 --> 01:18:23.400
back and I just did what I wanted to do within the confines of


1584
01:18:23.400 --> 01:18:24.100
the queen conks.


1585
01:18:25.600 --> 01:18:26.400
I hope that makes sense.


1586
01:18:27.400 --> 01:18:30.800
That was a really tough lesson took me a long time to figure


1587
01:18:30.800 --> 01:18:32.500
out what that even meant and how to work it.


1588
01:18:33.500 --> 01:18:34.800
Let me go back to Dolores.


1589
01:18:37.100 --> 01:18:39.200
Saturn is in my Aries.


1590
01:18:39.800 --> 01:18:40.500
seventh house


1591
01:18:43.800 --> 01:18:46.400
So your fourth house rule losing assignment. That's okay, but I'm


1592
01:18:46.400 --> 01:18:49.500
wondering why you said we have to look to Saturn specifically


1593
01:18:49.500 --> 01:18:52.400
because your moon because if your Pluto is


1594
01:18:52.400 --> 01:18:55.900
in Sagittarius, that means your moon unless you're mood unless


1595
01:18:55.900 --> 01:18:58.200
your Moon's over here. I'm you didn't


1596
01:18:58.200 --> 01:19:01.000
clarify so I assumed your moon was in the fourth house.


1597
01:19:02.200 --> 01:19:05.200
In Capricorn Capricorn's ruler Saturn. So we


1598
01:19:05.200 --> 01:19:08.100
need to know the condition of Saturn everything that's going on with it so that


1599
01:19:08.100 --> 01:19:11.100
we can understand the condition of your moon so that we


1600
01:19:11.100 --> 01:19:13.400
can then resolve the semi sex tile.


1601
01:19:15.600 --> 01:19:16.100
That make sense.


1602
01:19:23.300 --> 01:19:26.600
And then because we know Saturn's your Saturns in


1603
01:19:26.600 --> 01:19:27.100
Aries.


1604
01:19:27.700 --> 01:19:30.500
In the seventh house the seventh house which


1605
01:19:30.500 --> 01:19:33.800
we use to resolve your moon to like gain Clarity


1606
01:19:33.800 --> 01:19:36.600
on it. We need to know all the aspects Saturn not


1607
01:19:36.600 --> 01:19:39.400
in this class. But then also


1608
01:19:39.400 --> 01:19:42.400
where Mars is and how Mars's aspected because it layers in


1609
01:19:42.400 --> 01:19:45.200
and then one thing ties to the next ties to the next and then you use


1610
01:19:45.200 --> 01:19:48.400
all that information to resolve your identity and your


1611
01:19:48.400 --> 01:19:51.700
evolution of identity and your midlife crisis


1612
01:19:51.700 --> 01:19:54.800
that will eventually come up at some point when Pluto squares


1613
01:19:54.800 --> 01:19:58.600
Pluto because for you it's going to be Pluto in


1614
01:19:57.600 --> 01:20:01.100
your like it was for me Pluto in


1615
01:20:00.100 --> 01:20:01.600
the third house.


1616
01:20:02.900 --> 01:20:05.600
Pluto transiting the sixth house and that


1617
01:20:05.600 --> 01:20:09.000
is identity work identity health communication work.


1618
01:20:08.600 --> 01:20:11.600
All of that is going to go through a huge change


1619
01:20:11.600 --> 01:20:14.100
in a crisis where you may feel like, I don't know what I'm doing.


1620
01:20:14.100 --> 01:20:17.600
But if you get ahead of the game, you can you'll know exactly how


1621
01:20:17.600 --> 01:20:18.300
to do all of that.


1622
01:20:19.800 --> 01:20:21.800
Mars is also an area so you have Mars.


1623
01:20:22.400 --> 01:20:25.900
Sitting over here as well. So a lot of one-to-one relationships


1624
01:20:25.900 --> 01:20:28.600
starting your own business a lot of your power


1625
01:20:28.600 --> 01:20:31.300
here may come from your own business and


1626
01:20:31.300 --> 01:20:35.300
doing your own thing. Also Mars and


1627
01:20:35.300 --> 01:20:38.900
seventh house in areas, especially it's not the easiest placement because


1628
01:20:38.900 --> 01:20:42.200
you can default to arguing especially when


1629
01:20:42.200 --> 01:20:45.600
you're at home arguing with your partner, especially over


1630
01:20:45.600 --> 01:20:48.600
domestic issues and sex so


1631
01:20:48.600 --> 01:20:52.700
you have to have a healthy sex life. You have to work with a partner potentially


1632
01:20:51.700 --> 01:20:54.600
work with a partner or at least you don't


1633
01:20:54.600 --> 01:20:57.200
have to have your partner depends on where Venus and Juno are


1634
01:20:57.200 --> 01:21:00.000
but put all your efforts into doing something on your own


1635
01:21:00.300 --> 01:21:03.500
or working with the public or whatever and have a healthy sex life so that


1636
01:21:03.500 --> 01:21:06.900
you can pull it all together and everything is cool beans.


1637
01:21:11.500 --> 01:21:14.400
So whatever is going on Saturday contributes to this semi sextile.


1638
01:21:14.400 --> 01:21:15.400
Yes and also Mars.


1639
01:21:17.100 --> 01:21:20.300
Cleared that my progress chart Angie asks


1640
01:21:20.300 --> 01:21:23.800
has Pluto conjunct Vesta in


1641
01:21:23.800 --> 01:21:26.500
the 10,000 Libra Venus 2nd. This


1642
01:21:26.500 --> 01:21:27.000
is all about


1643
01:21:27.800 --> 01:21:30.500
your own business finding power within


1644
01:21:30.500 --> 01:21:33.200
your own business is something that either Sparks life has


1645
01:21:33.200 --> 01:21:36.300
to do with life gives life or lights you


1646
01:21:36.300 --> 01:21:39.200
up make you excited right now. It's all


1647
01:21:39.200 --> 01:21:44.000
about transformation within your career to use


1648
01:21:42.600 --> 01:21:47.000
shared resources or


1649
01:21:45.300 --> 01:21:49.000
do something that transforms what


1650
01:21:48.100 --> 01:21:51.500
you were doing into something that you actually really


1651
01:21:51.500 --> 01:21:54.200
enjoy doing that makes you want to kind of


1652
01:21:54.200 --> 01:21:55.200
get up and do it.


1653
01:21:56.500 --> 01:21:59.300
And then of course, look where Venus is look


1654
01:21:59.300 --> 01:22:02.600
where what's aspecting Pluto what's aspecting Venus


1655
01:22:02.600 --> 01:22:05.700
and whatnot and there's an element of like design


1656
01:22:05.700 --> 01:22:09.500
an element of beauty maybe


1657
01:22:08.500 --> 01:22:11.200
even fashion. That's all tied into


1658
01:22:11.200 --> 01:22:13.000
that as well because Libra and


1659
01:22:15.700 --> 01:22:18.200
Yeah, Libra is all about things that


1660
01:22:18.200 --> 01:22:18.500
are pretty.


1661
01:22:19.300 --> 01:22:22.200
It's also about Partnerships. So Partnerships could be brought into


1662
01:22:22.200 --> 01:22:25.000
it as well. Although Libra could just be used as your own


1663
01:22:25.200 --> 01:22:25.600
business as well.


1664
01:22:26.300 --> 01:22:29.400
Venus's fourth house Aries. So that has to do with anything that


1665
01:22:29.400 --> 01:22:32.100
has to do with the home selling homes putting your


1666
01:22:32.100 --> 01:22:36.200
your effort into domestication agriculture


1667
01:22:35.200 --> 01:22:38.300
again the sign then the


1668
01:22:38.300 --> 01:22:39.700
sign was you said Aries.


1669
01:22:40.400 --> 01:22:43.400
Okay. So Aries is like pioneering doing


1670
01:22:43.400 --> 01:22:46.200
things for yourself action using your physical body


1671
01:22:46.200 --> 01:22:49.000
to kind of do the things that are going to light you up


1672
01:22:49.900 --> 01:22:52.300
you physically doing things that are related to fourth house


1673
01:22:52.300 --> 01:22:53.500
stuff.


1674
01:22:56.500 --> 01:22:59.400
Taylor So when you say look to


1675
01:22:59.400 --> 01:23:02.200
your Saturn I'm guessing you also have to pick


1676
01:23:02.200 --> 01:23:05.900
what lens you're looking at through to actually understand it


1677
01:23:05.900 --> 01:23:08.400
to be able to transmit it. Yes lenses are


1678
01:23:08.400 --> 01:23:11.500
like the number one thing and I do it subconsciously now when


1679
01:23:11.500 --> 01:23:14.300
I'm looking at stuff like I know what each house means I know what each


1680
01:23:14.300 --> 01:23:16.300
planet means annoyed each sign means and


1681
01:23:17.600 --> 01:23:20.900
I go through the roster of everything in my head of


1682
01:23:20.900 --> 01:23:23.400
what it means while I'm doing a reading but I pull the


1683
01:23:23.400 --> 01:23:26.400
thing that's relevant to the topic which is the lens


1684
01:23:26.400 --> 01:23:27.700
so if we're looking at


1685
01:23:29.600 --> 01:23:30.400
if we're looking at


1686
01:23:31.900 --> 01:23:32.600
a career


1687
01:23:33.500 --> 01:23:36.000
and let's say what you're doing does not involve children, but you


1688
01:23:36.200 --> 01:23:39.200
got fifth house energy there. Well, then I've got to remove in my


1689
01:23:39.200 --> 01:23:42.900
head children from the lens for right now because


1690
01:23:42.900 --> 01:23:46.000
it doesn't apply to whatever you're doing, especially if


1691
01:23:45.100 --> 01:23:48.400
it's something like risque or whatever. I know children can't be


1692
01:23:48.400 --> 01:23:51.100
a part of that or shouldn't be a part of it, but the inner child can be


1693
01:23:51.900 --> 01:23:54.600
And I know romance could be a part of it speculation


1694
01:23:54.600 --> 01:23:59.100
risk gambling Sports entertainment,


1695
01:23:57.100 --> 01:24:00.100
like all that stuff could be


1696
01:24:00.100 --> 01:24:02.100
a part of it and that's all fifth house stuff as well.


1697
01:24:02.900 --> 01:24:05.200
So you want to look at the lens that you're looking through


1698
01:24:05.200 --> 01:24:08.500
and say okay, we're looking at it only as it


1699
01:24:08.500 --> 01:24:11.200
pertains to this thing to be


1700
01:24:11.200 --> 01:24:13.800
able to transmute that energy because you got to make it make sense.


1701
01:24:16.200 --> 01:24:19.300
Does this all do you guys get this do you get should I


1702
01:24:19.300 --> 01:24:19.700
move on or


1703
01:24:20.500 --> 01:24:22.000
Doesn't like all make sense.


1704
01:24:22.900 --> 01:24:25.500
And we went through a lot here even money


1705
01:24:25.500 --> 01:24:28.400
here, right so we know that North Node means this person


1706
01:24:28.400 --> 01:24:31.300
will make their own money later in life. They kind of came in


1707
01:24:31.300 --> 01:24:34.700
it's the thing is it's Pisces energy. So it's


1708
01:24:34.700 --> 01:24:37.200
like they may not have had much in s*** in


1709
01:24:37.200 --> 01:24:40.700
terms of shared resources when if they get married it


1710
01:24:40.700 --> 01:24:43.300
may come through their inlaws, you know, just for


1711
01:24:43.300 --> 01:24:44.700
like their wedding or whatever but


1712
01:24:45.800 --> 01:24:48.300
They really need to find a career that makes the


1713
01:24:48.300 --> 01:24:52.900
money where they are. They're doing something that's of service reputation or


1714
01:24:52.900 --> 01:24:54.100
not reputation repetition.


1715
01:24:57.500 --> 01:25:00.000
Yeah, or potentially in health. All right, that's how they


1716
01:25:00.200 --> 01:25:05.600
would get it and they would focus on the health of their money and they would


1717
01:25:03.600 --> 01:25:06.600
have to have a job


1718
01:25:06.600 --> 01:25:09.800
where their abundant this person is actually set up for financial financial


1719
01:25:09.800 --> 01:25:12.500
success. So they don't have to reach very hard but there are restrictions on


1720
01:25:12.500 --> 01:25:15.500
money and there are systems. So if they're smart,


1721
01:25:15.500 --> 01:25:18.600
they'll utilize daily systems here


1722
01:25:18.600 --> 01:25:20.600
and at seven degrees


1723
01:25:24.700 --> 01:25:27.300
There's an agitation to here. So I'd have


1724
01:25:27.300 --> 01:25:30.700
to resolve this to get that. I'm not going to talk about that right now. Do I have anything else? I


1725
01:25:30.700 --> 01:25:34.100
have Vesta here as an inconjunction which


1726
01:25:33.100 --> 01:25:37.300
makes sense Virgo service.


1727
01:25:36.300 --> 01:25:39.100
So this is not somebody who would service other


1728
01:25:39.100 --> 01:25:42.100
people's money. There is a trying here with


1729
01:25:42.100 --> 01:25:42.900
Chiron.


1730
01:25:44.200 --> 01:25:47.700
In Taurus with the sun opposite all of this. So when


1731
01:25:47.700 --> 01:25:50.100
it comes in this has to do with Investments, so when it


1732
01:25:50.100 --> 01:25:50.500
comes to


1733
01:25:51.600 --> 01:25:54.000
Investments they should.


1734
01:25:55.400 --> 01:25:58.500
Seek somebody who will be a good


1735
01:25:58.500 --> 01:26:02.000
employee. So to speak who they


1736
01:26:01.400 --> 01:26:04.400
feel is serving them as opposed


1737
01:26:04.400 --> 01:26:07.500
to them serving because the restrictions and the limitations


1738
01:26:07.500 --> 01:26:11.900
on their money, they should be investing especially investing


1739
01:26:11.900 --> 01:26:14.300
in like entertain like overseas entertainment maybe


1740
01:26:14.300 --> 01:26:17.400
overseas film overseas, you know


1741
01:26:17.400 --> 01:26:20.400
Sports cultural things that are entertainment based


1742
01:26:20.400 --> 01:26:23.600
or you know, children's even


1743
01:26:23.600 --> 01:26:24.800
why am I getting that?


1744
01:26:26.900 --> 01:26:29.400
Jupiter oh even language based things


1745
01:26:29.400 --> 01:26:32.400
like like some of those big companies that like


1746
01:26:32.400 --> 01:26:35.500
teach foreign language or whatnot. There's a lot of things that they could invest in


1747
01:26:35.500 --> 01:26:38.900
but they should do so in a way that is a long-term strategy


1748
01:26:38.900 --> 01:26:41.100
because it is Saturn that we're talking


1749
01:26:41.100 --> 01:26:44.400
about here. Also their career should bring the money so they have multiple things.


1750
01:26:44.400 --> 01:26:47.200
Remember you look at it in multiple ways. So we know that


1751
01:26:47.200 --> 01:26:50.300
investing is one opportunity for this person in a very specific


1752
01:26:50.300 --> 01:26:51.100
strategic way.


1753
01:26:52.200 --> 01:26:55.900
Which is transmuting the energy the other is using their career and


1754
01:26:55.900 --> 01:26:58.900
their everyday here to be able to and its


1755
01:26:58.900 --> 01:27:01.500
rulers up in the tenth house in Chiron using that to


1756
01:27:01.500 --> 01:27:04.400
bring in their Public Image and reputation anything they


1757
01:27:04.400 --> 01:27:06.700
put out to bring in money if they do nothing.


1758
01:27:08.400 --> 01:27:11.500
They may end up making money through work as they do have part of Fortune naturally


1759
01:27:11.500 --> 01:27:14.100
here and that is luck and abundance. You don't always have to use this. But


1760
01:27:14.100 --> 01:27:17.500
if you do you make more but Saturn in the second house can create


1761
01:27:17.500 --> 01:27:20.500
especially at the beginning of Life hardship on


1762
01:27:20.500 --> 01:27:23.600
money restrictions on money and with Chiron


1763
01:27:23.600 --> 01:27:26.100
here. It's like this person in the beginning of their


1764
01:27:26.100 --> 01:27:29.700
life could have tried to go job the job finding something that would be lucrative probably


1765
01:27:29.700 --> 01:27:33.600
ended up in either Finance banking restaurants


1766
01:27:32.600 --> 01:27:35.200
serving anything like that


1767
01:27:35.200 --> 01:27:38.200
and just could not find a way


1768
01:27:38.200 --> 01:27:41.500
to make money and do things on their own and the reason it's because the


1769
01:27:41.500 --> 01:27:43.200
energies would be playing out default.


1770
01:27:44.500 --> 01:27:48.000
Everything that I said about their career is me transmuting the


1771
01:27:47.600 --> 01:27:50.600
energies into something that's more favorable. So


1772
01:27:50.600 --> 01:27:53.800
you when I jump on calls and I do readings with people I let


1773
01:27:53.800 --> 01:27:56.400
them explain how it's happened. I can usually guess


1774
01:27:56.400 --> 01:27:59.400
how it's happened because I'm reading the energies and


1775
01:27:59.400 --> 01:28:02.300
we can see all the details but it's all about how do you take that


1776
01:28:02.300 --> 01:28:05.300
energy and take it a step further? Like I said with the condition and the


1777
01:28:05.300 --> 01:28:09.100
relationship that this person has with money this person's hypercritical of


1778
01:28:08.100 --> 01:28:09.800
money as well.


1779
01:28:10.600 --> 01:28:13.200
So, you know, they they have a


1780
01:28:13.200 --> 01:28:16.100
taste for luxury but can't always get luxury so they


1781
01:28:16.100 --> 01:28:19.500
probably get knock-offs and things like that because of this opposition and the


1782
01:28:19.500 --> 01:28:22.300
Chiron up here and whatnot. So there this is


1783
01:28:22.300 --> 01:28:25.100
the type of person like always wanted a Louis Vuitton but ended up


1784
01:28:25.100 --> 01:28:26.200
with a Louis vuittoni.


1785
01:28:26.800 --> 01:28:29.200
Right Taylor says I'm


1786
01:28:29.200 --> 01:28:32.200
eating this shop. This is the whole point. Like I think


1787
01:28:32.200 --> 01:28:35.100
that this is if you're following along and you're


1788
01:28:35.100 --> 01:28:38.100
getting it, I think that this is the most exciting part of astrology. This is


1789
01:28:38.100 --> 01:28:41.500
what I do on all my readings. This is literally the part of of


1790
01:28:41.500 --> 01:28:44.300
my readings that I enjoy because this is what I think astrology is about


1791
01:28:45.100 --> 01:28:48.300
I don't do natal chart readings. I don't even do sinistry readings


1792
01:28:48.300 --> 01:28:51.200
anymore because I can do them. I'm gonna teach you


1793
01:28:51.200 --> 01:28:54.500
guys how to do them, but I don't do them because I don't get much out


1794
01:28:54.500 --> 01:28:57.600
of them personally because I don't think that they're very helpful. I think


1795
01:28:57.600 --> 01:29:00.100
that you know learning you should be able to


1796
01:29:00.100 --> 01:29:03.300
learn and teach yourself how the energies of


1797
01:29:03.300 --> 01:29:06.300
manifested In Your Chart I can help you. I can do one-on-one if somebody


1798
01:29:06.300 --> 01:29:09.200
really wanted to spend an hour and go through their chart I


1799
01:29:09.200 --> 01:29:12.100
will do it, but I won't get through with an hour. I won't


1800
01:29:12.100 --> 01:29:15.400
get through their child probably get to the fifth or sixth house and it


1801
01:29:15.400 --> 01:29:18.000
won't be as detailed as I as I want it to be


1802
01:29:18.600 --> 01:29:21.100
for me. It's all about this is how my life is playing out.


1803
01:29:21.100 --> 01:29:24.300
This is what I want to do. This is how I want it to play out. How do I make that happen?


1804
01:29:24.300 --> 01:29:27.400
That's where I come in. I say boom. Here's this


1805
01:29:27.400 --> 01:29:30.400
energy. Here's what it can be. How do we now align ourselves


1806
01:29:30.400 --> 01:29:31.000
and do it?


1807
01:29:32.400 --> 01:29:35.700
Center conjunct my mercury in areas in conjuncts my Chiron that's an


1808
01:29:35.700 --> 01:29:38.100
interesting one and the Scorpio's second house. Okay.


1809
01:29:39.400 --> 01:29:42.300
It's like issues with insurance and debt


1810
01:29:42.300 --> 01:29:45.200
and shared resources and stuff. That's really somebody who needs


1811
01:29:45.200 --> 01:29:45.400
to.


1812
01:29:47.700 --> 01:29:50.200
I mean the occult is really good for you. But there's other things


1813
01:29:50.200 --> 01:29:53.500
you can do and my Mars and areas and then my Pluto


1814
01:29:53.500 --> 01:29:56.400
Moon semi-sexile. I'm starting to wonder if I'm okay.


1815
01:29:57.600 --> 01:30:00.300
That's the thing is nobody has a bad chart. There are


1816
01:30:00.300 --> 01:30:03.400
more challenging charts than some other ones like some people did get the the


1817
01:30:03.400 --> 01:30:04.800
luck of the draw, I guess with the


1818
01:30:05.500 --> 01:30:08.500
You know and other people got the Short Straw so to speak


1819
01:30:08.500 --> 01:30:12.500
but none of these and none of these energies are impossible


1820
01:30:11.500 --> 01:30:14.400
to work with some people


1821
01:30:14.400 --> 01:30:18.100
have more hardship and I just kind of chalk that up to a your


1822
01:30:17.100 --> 01:30:20.700
childhood, but be astrologically and


1823
01:30:20.700 --> 01:30:22.000
spiritually speaking Karma.


1824
01:30:22.600 --> 01:30:25.200
What did you do in your last life? I don't know. I could


1825
01:30:25.200 --> 01:30:28.500
see kind of the energies that we reference for past life


1826
01:30:28.500 --> 01:30:31.400
energy like Pluto Saturn some people say the


1827
01:30:31.400 --> 01:30:31.800
South node.


1828
01:30:32.700 --> 01:30:35.300
The moon itself to see kind of like what you


1829
01:30:35.300 --> 01:30:38.200
brought in, but it's all about clearing it. If you can clear some of


1830
01:30:38.200 --> 01:30:41.400
these retrogrades and work on these things internally. You can be a very powerful person


1831
01:30:41.400 --> 01:30:43.500
this time and skip the fuss.


1832
01:30:44.900 --> 01:30:47.600
Dolores says Jupiter conjuncture ascendant yields


1833
01:30:47.600 --> 01:30:50.300
whose ruler is in Taurus 10th house


1834
01:30:50.300 --> 01:30:54.000
getting even not kidding what she need to worry about getting fat off at Jupiter. I


1835
01:30:53.300 --> 01:30:56.400
thought that when I pulled this up and I saw you were


1836
01:30:56.400 --> 01:30:59.300
in my class today. I literally thought that I was like, oh my


1837
01:30:59.300 --> 01:31:02.700
goodness. This is a getting fat off of jupiteration. Whenever Jupiter


1838
01:31:02.700 --> 01:31:05.300
is conjunct the


1839
01:31:05.300 --> 01:31:08.100
ascendant that you have to worry about that anyway, because it is expansion of


1840
01:31:08.100 --> 01:31:11.600
the body. Now. This person could be a bodybuilder and could


1841
01:31:11.600 --> 01:31:14.400
have a strict diet which this person


1842
01:31:14.400 --> 01:31:17.600
could actually get a nice dietary routine


1843
01:31:17.600 --> 01:31:20.400
and become very strong and very


1844
01:31:20.400 --> 01:31:23.000
fit especially since this is all spilling into the ninth house


1845
01:31:23.100 --> 01:31:26.300
which has Aries in here with this this person could also be


1846
01:31:26.300 --> 01:31:29.300
a bodybuilder and could use that in their performances as well.


1847
01:31:30.400 --> 01:31:33.500
So that's very interesting or they


1848
01:31:33.500 --> 01:31:36.700
could you know do that and still feel that insecurity and


1849
01:31:36.700 --> 01:31:39.200
overcompensate with food and whatnot. They can go


1850
01:31:39.200 --> 01:31:43.000
both ways and I'm sure through the transits that they've had their ups


1851
01:31:42.200 --> 01:31:45.500
and downs when it comes but yes, absolutely this person could


1852
01:31:46.300 --> 01:31:49.400
Get very big and it could because it's in the tenth house


1853
01:31:49.400 --> 01:31:53.500
could have structural issues. Meaning teeth hair


1854
01:31:52.500 --> 01:31:55.800
bones type issues


1855
01:31:55.800 --> 01:31:57.000
that are related to food.


1856
01:31:59.500 --> 01:32:02.100
And there's more to it. But you know, that's something they'd have to


1857
01:32:02.100 --> 01:32:05.800
worry about and conversely they can heal themselves with food because Chiron


1858
01:32:05.800 --> 01:32:06.000
is there.


1859
01:32:07.300 --> 01:32:10.600
That's the beautiful thing is somebody with this type of placement hire


1860
01:32:10.600 --> 01:32:13.500
on in Taurus in general has the ability to heal themselves with


1861
01:32:13.500 --> 01:32:16.400
food and help other people through nutrition


1862
01:32:16.400 --> 01:32:19.400
if they so choose and


1863
01:32:19.400 --> 01:32:21.700
the aspects. Otherwise align


1864
01:32:23.100 --> 01:32:23.600
but definitely


1865
01:32:24.700 --> 01:32:27.500
definitely some of that getting fat off of Jupiter vibes.


1866
01:32:33.800 --> 01:32:34.500
first that


1867
01:32:35.500 --> 01:32:38.200
feel like I should have named it. I should have named


1868
01:32:38.200 --> 01:32:38.600
it Taylor.


1869
01:32:39.500 --> 01:32:39.600
but


1870
01:32:41.900 --> 01:32:42.500
this is for


1871
01:32:43.100 --> 01:32:46.100
this is for everybody who takes this class because we made it


1872
01:32:46.100 --> 01:32:49.000
for a t-shirt. But this is Taylor's calling card here. This is


1873
01:32:49.300 --> 01:32:52.300
the getting fat off of Jupiter that we're gonna be putting on the t-shirt


1874
01:32:52.300 --> 01:32:55.300
for Mystic Rebels fashion stuff. So


1875
01:32:55.300 --> 01:32:58.400
this is literally it though like because we talked


1876
01:32:58.400 --> 01:33:00.700
about how Jupiter does not just mean


1877
01:33:02.800 --> 01:33:05.800
all the good stuff in the philosophy. It's also expansion and


1878
01:33:05.800 --> 01:33:08.400
when it's linked to your physical body and it's


1879
01:33:08.400 --> 01:33:11.500
linked to Taurus it can mean that you overeat and


1880
01:33:11.500 --> 01:33:12.800
you indulge and it can cause


1881
01:33:14.900 --> 01:33:16.800
You know expansion in that way.


1882
01:33:18.400 --> 01:33:20.200
Funny. Yeah, it's fun.


1883
01:33:21.300 --> 01:33:23.300
The lowers the buff babe. Yes, Angie.


1884
01:33:24.200 --> 01:33:27.000
I'm laughing and crying both get fat off of Jupiter. My parent


1885
01:33:27.500 --> 01:33:29.700
past life debt. This is my favorite class all


1886
01:33:30.700 --> 01:33:31.100
yay.


1887
01:33:32.800 --> 01:33:35.300
Yeah, like I said, this is like this is


1888
01:33:35.300 --> 01:33:38.400
the one I've been waiting to do, but you can't get to this without


1889
01:33:38.400 --> 01:33:41.100
all the other stuff. You have to know how to read it. But once you learn how


1890
01:33:41.100 --> 01:33:42.300
to read it y'all.


1891
01:33:43.300 --> 01:33:46.600
Let me pause for a second the way that I have amassed. My


1892
01:33:46.600 --> 01:33:48.000
abundance is by doing this.


1893
01:33:48.900 --> 01:33:51.200
And I don't know if that's clear. But you know


1894
01:33:51.200 --> 01:33:54.100
the house we live in the cars. We drive the money in our


1895
01:33:54.100 --> 01:33:57.700
bank account the multiple businesses. We have understanding which businesses


1896
01:33:57.700 --> 01:34:00.600
that align with what we need to do understanding when


1897
01:34:00.600 --> 01:34:03.200
to start a business and when not we move a lot.


1898
01:34:03.200 --> 01:34:06.400
So we've considered staying here moving back and we're currently as


1899
01:34:06.400 --> 01:34:09.400
I record this in Tampa, Florida. We're thinking about moving back to


1900
01:34:09.400 --> 01:34:13.200
Los Angeles, California, and there's a lot that goes into it right manifestation, but


1901
01:34:12.200 --> 01:34:15.600
also just understanding trance. It's timing energies


1902
01:34:15.600 --> 01:34:18.800
Astro cartography pulling it all together, but


1903
01:34:20.200 --> 01:34:23.000
we are that's what we're doing.


1904
01:34:24.100 --> 01:34:27.700
is we are deciding we're manifesting but by using exactly what


1905
01:34:27.700 --> 01:34:30.600
I'm teaching you in this class is how we got the abundance


1906
01:34:30.600 --> 01:34:33.900
that we have and I'm very thankful for stumbling basically


1907
01:34:33.900 --> 01:34:35.500
upon astrology even though I've been


1908
01:34:36.200 --> 01:34:39.700
Attracted to it. So to speak my entire life. It wasn't


1909
01:34:39.700 --> 01:34:42.400
until the pandemic where I you know


1910
01:34:42.400 --> 01:34:45.500
is a little bit before that but during that time. I had a lot of time to really


1911
01:34:45.500 --> 01:34:48.100
just like obsess and then I developed all this and


1912
01:34:48.100 --> 01:34:52.800
then after we moved and I had my freedom back we started you


1913
01:34:51.800 --> 01:34:52.800
know,


1914
01:34:53.800 --> 01:34:56.300
Doing this professionally and now here I am teaching you guys so


1915
01:34:56.300 --> 01:34:59.500
that you guys can manifest because distribution of


1916
01:34:59.500 --> 01:35:02.100
wealth in a healthy manner. Hell, yeah. I'm all about


1917
01:35:02.100 --> 01:35:03.400
it an entrepreneurship as well.


1918
01:35:04.600 --> 01:35:07.800
So but the transits do those energies


1919
01:35:07.800 --> 01:35:10.300
just highlight the planet's houses they pass or


1920
01:35:10.300 --> 01:35:13.200
do you aspect each Transit? Can you add


1921
01:35:13.200 --> 01:35:16.000
transits and Dolores and just explain one of them?


1922
01:35:16.900 --> 01:35:19.200
I'm going to hold off on that because I'm actually about to get


1923
01:35:19.200 --> 01:35:22.400
into trance. It's because that is the next thing it's extremely important


1924
01:35:22.400 --> 01:35:25.300
and I want to make sure so you will get an


1925
01:35:25.300 --> 01:35:28.700
answer to that just not this moment do the transits affect


1926
01:35:28.700 --> 01:35:31.300
the timing on manifesting. Yes, because the next thing we're


1927
01:35:31.300 --> 01:35:35.000
about to talk about is divine timing and divine timing


1928
01:35:34.400 --> 01:35:37.800
talks about focus and transits. So


1929
01:35:37.800 --> 01:35:39.200
give me a second. I'll get into that.


1930
01:35:40.300 --> 01:35:42.500
Taylor who I have a lot of student loan debt


1931
01:35:43.400 --> 01:35:46.100
That's that second house Chiron that I was talking about.


1932
01:35:46.100 --> 01:35:49.300
I said I mentioned debt that's shared resources


1933
01:35:49.300 --> 01:35:52.500
debt in inheritance issues with that and taxes


1934
01:35:52.500 --> 01:35:54.700
and whatnot. You're Gonna Want To


1935
01:35:55.600 --> 01:35:58.200
Change that energy so that you can


1936
01:35:58.200 --> 01:36:01.600
you can amass the wealth and pull that and then


1937
01:36:01.600 --> 01:36:04.900
get rid of this debt. Also, there may be ways to actually consolidate


1938
01:36:04.900 --> 01:36:07.200
or get rid of this debt in a different way based off


1939
01:36:07.200 --> 01:36:08.200
of using your Energies.


1940
01:36:09.600 --> 01:36:12.100
I think during my Saturn return that may hurt unless I


1941
01:36:12.100 --> 01:36:15.300
plan now by transmuting these energies to be


1942
01:36:15.300 --> 01:36:18.300
more prepared. Yes queen. That is the whole point is to


1943
01:36:18.300 --> 01:36:21.900
transmute ahead of time and try to use transits for


1944
01:36:21.900 --> 01:36:24.200
divine time. You can transmute at any point. You're just


1945
01:36:24.200 --> 01:36:28.800
more aligned and not fighting energy as


1946
01:36:27.800 --> 01:36:30.000
the transits come. So I


1947
01:36:30.400 --> 01:36:33.100
like to I transmute on a daily basis. I don't


1948
01:36:33.100 --> 01:36:36.500
care about the transits unless they are adversely affecting me


1949
01:36:36.500 --> 01:36:39.400
and then I don't try to transmute during that I wait


1950
01:36:39.400 --> 01:36:42.300
and then I do it later. So you have two stages


1951
01:36:42.300 --> 01:36:46.200
one is just naturally doing it doing it when you can those


1952
01:36:45.200 --> 01:36:49.200
aren't event based transits create


1953
01:36:48.200 --> 01:36:51.300
the events. But if it's something when like


1954
01:36:51.300 --> 01:36:54.700
you're like you're you're psyche your psychology your daily habits


1955
01:36:54.700 --> 01:36:57.600
the way you speak you can kind of do that almost at


1956
01:36:57.600 --> 01:37:00.500
any time as long as there aren't energies you're working against to


1957
01:37:00.500 --> 01:37:04.400
do it. So you don't need Divine timing for all manifestation Divine


1958
01:37:03.400 --> 01:37:06.400
timing is for very specific things and it


1959
01:37:06.400 --> 01:37:08.800
helps guide you into where to focus your energy.


1960
01:37:09.400 --> 01:37:12.500
So that you can do things faster quicker and just streamline it


1961
01:37:12.500 --> 01:37:13.800
into your goals. So


1962
01:37:14.700 --> 01:37:17.700
as Angie asked I am going to get here into


1963
01:37:19.400 --> 01:37:22.500
The transits so let's pretend that this person


1964
01:37:22.500 --> 01:37:25.500
Dolores is alive and she was born in 79


1965
01:37:25.500 --> 01:37:28.200
and this is everything that's going on. Now. I'm I'm not


1966
01:37:28.200 --> 01:37:31.400
gonna talk about progressions. Although they are very important. That'll be a separate class


1967
01:37:31.400 --> 01:37:34.200
where we talk about that because the stage of life she's in is


1968
01:37:34.200 --> 01:37:37.500
important if she moved and she relocated that's also


1969
01:37:37.500 --> 01:37:40.800
a part of manifestation. Sometimes your


1970
01:37:40.800 --> 01:37:43.400
energies with the things that you want to do. So like maybe


1971
01:37:43.400 --> 01:37:46.900
this place I mean her natal energies


1972
01:37:46.900 --> 01:37:49.100
are highly supportive it maybe she wants to move.


1973
01:37:51.200 --> 01:37:54.100
Her energies a little bit different. So maybe she wants to


1974
01:37:54.100 --> 01:37:57.100
throw, you know, it might be easier if we put


1975
01:37:57.100 --> 01:38:00.500
Saturn in the third house and we put Jupiter in the second


1976
01:38:00.500 --> 01:38:03.500
house. So maybe and I'll do this really quickly


1977
01:38:03.500 --> 01:38:06.100
because it's not meant to be a part of this class, but I


1978
01:38:06.100 --> 01:38:10.600
want to show this real quick because it's important to understand that maybe and


1979
01:38:09.600 --> 01:38:12.200
we did relocation as a


1980
01:38:12.200 --> 01:38:15.400
separate Astro cartography as a separate thing. But let's say since


1981
01:38:15.400 --> 01:38:18.200
we're talking about stage performance that we're just looking at Los Angeles,


1982
01:38:18.200 --> 01:38:21.500
California. And again, I'm not going to get into this because I've done this in


1983
01:38:21.500 --> 01:38:24.300
a separate class, but for Dolores maybe she


1984
01:38:24.300 --> 01:38:27.200
wants to move Jupiter into her second house, and


1985
01:38:27.200 --> 01:38:30.600
I know that by her moving West I chose Memphis Tennessee is


1986
01:38:30.600 --> 01:38:33.300
where she's born. So moving West it's going to move her


1987
01:38:33.300 --> 01:38:33.700
chart.


1988
01:38:34.800 --> 01:38:37.200
Counterclockwise, right so it's going to move this stuff down


1989
01:38:37.200 --> 01:38:38.000
here. Whoops.


1990
01:38:38.900 --> 01:38:41.400
And whatnot. If she moves back east or goes


1991
01:38:41.400 --> 01:38:44.300
across overseas, it's gonna move it clockwise and I


1992
01:38:44.300 --> 01:38:47.200
look here at our Astro cartography and I


1993
01:38:47.200 --> 01:38:50.500
pull up and you know, she's got all this these energies here


1994
01:38:50.500 --> 01:38:53.200
and we're not getting that deep into it. If she were to


1995
01:38:53.200 --> 01:38:56.200
go further east there would be a Chiron on the mid head line. So if she's


1996
01:38:56.200 --> 01:38:59.300
a Healer a nurse holistic practitioner or


1997
01:38:59.300 --> 01:39:00.900
anything like that, I might want to look over here.


1998
01:39:02.300 --> 01:39:05.300
I don't use the line as the tell-all. I always look at


1999
01:39:05.300 --> 01:39:08.100
a relocated chart because this could be something else it could sit in


2000
01:39:08.100 --> 01:39:11.200
a different house and it could mean something a little bit different. So always


2001
01:39:11.200 --> 01:39:14.400
look at a relocated chart, but we know that over here


2002
01:39:14.400 --> 01:39:17.600
she has she's definitely


2003
01:39:17.600 --> 01:39:20.100
some sort of actress or singer or something like


2004
01:39:20.100 --> 01:39:23.200
that. She has Venus and Jupiter Crossing so we know that


2005
01:39:23.200 --> 01:39:26.200
Luck first but Prosperity we have to look how Venus and Jupiter


2006
01:39:26.200 --> 01:39:29.700
sit but Venus owner midheaven Jupiter's owner. I own her


2007
01:39:29.700 --> 01:39:32.000
ascendant. So this is literally she could be


2008
01:39:32.400 --> 01:39:36.000
very well known and and respected


2009
01:39:35.100 --> 01:39:38.100
for the things that


2010
01:39:38.100 --> 01:39:39.200
she does in Los Angeles.


2011
01:39:40.500 --> 01:39:43.800
We do have a North Node on the IC but that has zero orb


2012
01:39:43.800 --> 01:39:46.500
of influence because this is two points. So you have to be literally pretty


2013
01:39:46.500 --> 01:39:49.000
much on it Jupiter sending is all the way out here. It's not going to


2014
01:39:49.300 --> 01:39:53.200
apply. I know it's too far if I go to disharmonious aspects Pluto


2015
01:39:52.200 --> 01:39:56.400
send it I'd have to look at the relocated chart Neptune square


2016
01:39:56.400 --> 01:39:59.300
of the mid heaven. And then if I look at harmonious, I have


2017
01:39:59.300 --> 01:40:02.300
Chiron sex tile the ascendant going straight


2018
01:40:02.300 --> 01:40:06.700
through Los Angeles. So again healing through the body anything


2019
01:40:05.700 --> 01:40:08.000
that's physical so it could


2020
01:40:08.100 --> 01:40:12.300
be dance. It could be it could be stage performance


2021
01:40:11.300 --> 01:40:14.400
or whatever that is very healing and it


2022
01:40:14.400 --> 01:40:17.600
heals other people as well. And then we have North Node


2023
01:40:17.600 --> 01:40:20.700
sextile the ascendant what not. That's true cartography.


2024
01:40:20.700 --> 01:40:23.500
This is her relocated chart in Los Angeles for


2025
01:40:23.500 --> 01:40:24.100
Dolores.


2026
01:40:25.300 --> 01:40:28.300
We have a lot going on over here chiron's in the 11th


2027
01:40:28.300 --> 01:40:31.900
house. That's probably one of the easiest places aside


2028
01:40:31.900 --> 01:40:34.200
from aspects that I think I've seen Chiron is that


2029
01:40:34.200 --> 01:40:37.600
people don't even realize that it's usually problems with friends groups large,


2030
01:40:37.600 --> 01:40:41.200
you know, organization or organizations


2031
01:40:40.200 --> 01:40:43.300
and teams and things like that, but it


2032
01:40:43.300 --> 01:40:46.000
it only plays out that way. So if you're a solo act or anything


2033
01:40:46.100 --> 01:40:49.100
like that probably not a big deal, we do have the sixth house


2034
01:40:49.100 --> 01:40:52.600
in doing this would be great. She should move from Memphis based


2035
01:40:52.600 --> 01:40:55.100
off of the quick analyze analyzing and I


2036
01:40:55.100 --> 01:40:58.900
would always go deeper, but she could move from here have something


2037
01:40:58.900 --> 01:41:01.600
that is like Neptune and based for


2038
01:41:01.600 --> 01:41:04.500
her job. So, you know, like I said film dancing


2039
01:41:04.500 --> 01:41:07.300
music whatever and then that brings her money,


2040
01:41:07.300 --> 01:41:10.600
so she should from Memphis go to Los


2041
01:41:10.600 --> 01:41:13.200
Angeles and live out her career a mid heaven in


2042
01:41:13.200 --> 01:41:16.500
Pisces. By the way. This is very similar to my energy amid heaven


2043
01:41:16.500 --> 01:41:19.600
and Pisces and then that in the sixth house which brings the mid


2044
01:41:19.600 --> 01:41:22.300
Heaven and the life purpose back in to


2045
01:41:23.400 --> 01:41:26.200
Her daily job and then Mars and Venus both


2046
01:41:26.200 --> 01:41:26.500
in.


2047
01:41:28.100 --> 01:41:31.300
In areas in the tenth house here like


2048
01:41:31.300 --> 01:41:34.500
this is amazing and there is an agitation between


2049
01:41:34.500 --> 01:41:37.700
Venus and the midheaven


2050
01:41:37.700 --> 01:41:40.300
so she would have to figure out her, you


2051
01:41:40.300 --> 01:41:43.400
know her Partners the people she works with her home life


2052
01:41:43.400 --> 01:41:47.100
and where her Chiron is. So her reputation


2053
01:41:46.100 --> 01:41:49.200
needs finesse with the things that she


2054
01:41:49.200 --> 01:41:52.500
wants to do, but we would be able to work with all that but basically


2055
01:41:52.500 --> 01:41:55.100
she could make a ton of ton of ton of ton a ton of money as long


2056
01:41:55.100 --> 01:41:58.500
as she's using that Chiron properly because that ruler is in the 11th house


2057
01:41:58.500 --> 01:42:01.400
so she has to focus on it. But yeah


2058
01:42:01.400 --> 01:42:05.400
anyway, so that's the Loris. That's why Astro


2059
01:42:04.400 --> 01:42:07.400
cartography so freaking important, but also


2060
01:42:07.400 --> 01:42:08.200
reading it properly


2061
01:42:09.700 --> 01:42:12.400
Seems like she may be less likely to give head off of Jupiter but


2062
01:42:12.400 --> 01:42:15.600
spend more money on food diet. I pulled


2063
01:42:15.600 --> 01:42:18.300
it off so I can't double check that. But yeah, it could be but remember


2064
01:42:18.300 --> 01:42:21.600
that when you move your natal energy still stick with you. But so


2065
01:42:21.600 --> 01:42:24.400
that underlying propensity is still there even in


2066
01:42:24.400 --> 01:42:27.600
the new area, but it does create new and I


2067
01:42:27.600 --> 01:42:30.500
didn't look at it because it's not an astro cartography class, but down here


2068
01:42:30.500 --> 01:42:33.700
these last two lines when you're looking at aspects on astro.com or


2069
01:42:33.700 --> 01:42:36.500
your ascendant your midheaven two of the angles. So you


2070
01:42:36.500 --> 01:42:39.200
always look here because when your angles change it tells you if


2071
01:42:39.200 --> 01:42:42.800
you have more conflict in a certain area. If you have more piece different energies


2072
01:42:42.800 --> 01:42:45.300
are working together. So you'll want to check that out.


2073
01:42:45.300 --> 01:42:48.300
But again, that's a different class. We're gonna stick here. So


2074
01:42:48.300 --> 01:42:51.700
I'm gonna talk about transits look at all of this right now. So right now,


2075
01:42:52.700 --> 01:42:56.100
What is today's date March 26 2023


2076
01:42:55.100 --> 01:42:59.900
is the date. I'm recording this. So whenever


2077
01:42:59.900 --> 01:43:02.300
you're watching it, this is for now not when


2078
01:43:02.300 --> 01:43:03.300
you're seeing it here.


2079
01:43:04.200 --> 01:43:05.100
Let me close that real quick.


2080
01:43:06.300 --> 01:43:09.100
Divine timing Divine timing talks about where is the


2081
01:43:09.100 --> 01:43:13.100
focus whenever I do readings for customers, I


2082
01:43:12.100 --> 01:43:16.100
start with the same Planet always it


2083
01:43:15.100 --> 01:43:18.100
doesn't matter what we're talking about. I always start


2084
01:43:18.100 --> 01:43:21.800
with the same Planet because it is Father time and father


2085
01:43:21.800 --> 01:43:24.200
time has to do with Divine timing has to


2086
01:43:24.200 --> 01:43:27.400
do with where you're focus is where you're responsibility duties restrictions and


2087
01:43:27.400 --> 01:43:30.400
all that and that is planet. Saturn Saturn is


2088
01:43:30.400 --> 01:43:33.600
the most important in my opinion planet outside of


2089
01:43:33.600 --> 01:43:33.900
the Moon.


2090
01:43:34.800 --> 01:43:37.900
But the Moon is on a daily level to understand what


2091
01:43:37.900 --> 01:43:41.000
the restrictions are where your focus is going to be and the


2092
01:43:40.800 --> 01:43:43.300
hardships restrictions or anything that


2093
01:43:43.300 --> 01:43:47.600
is going to come up that is going to be significant


2094
01:43:46.600 --> 01:43:49.300
for your long-term goals and


2095
01:43:49.300 --> 01:43:51.000
your future Saturn.


2096
01:43:51.800 --> 01:43:54.100
So everyone right now has Saturn in the same


2097
01:43:54.100 --> 01:43:57.500
spot that makes it easy when you go chart to chart. I know exactly where to


2098
01:43:57.500 --> 01:44:00.300
look all the transit storage in the same spot for everybody. But right now for


2099
01:44:00.300 --> 01:44:03.200
Dolores not including relocations and


2100
01:44:03.200 --> 01:44:06.100
not including progression Saturn is going over the Eighth House.


2101
01:44:06.100 --> 01:44:09.800
The 8th house has to do a shared resources anything. That's Hayden taboo


2102
01:44:09.800 --> 01:44:11.300
anything that has to do with


2103
01:44:13.100 --> 01:44:17.200
the occult debt installments inheritances


2104
01:44:17.900 --> 01:44:20.500
Secrets lies deception


2105
01:44:20.500 --> 01:44:23.400
whatnot. That is all the Eighth House energy. It is


2106
01:44:23.400 --> 01:44:27.900
in Pisces. So now we're adding that all into illusion to


2107
01:44:29.800 --> 01:44:31.700
you know media to


2108
01:44:34.500 --> 01:44:38.000
brain fart to dance to music


2109
01:44:37.400 --> 01:44:40.500
to spirituality, right


2110
01:44:40.500 --> 01:44:41.000
so


2111
01:44:41.900 --> 01:44:44.300
Just for also a heads up kind of as a


2112
01:44:44.300 --> 01:44:44.700
tangent.


2113
01:44:45.500 --> 01:44:48.200
Saturn are moving into Pisces is the reason why so many people are


2114
01:44:48.200 --> 01:44:51.300
getting into astrology getting into taboo and spirituality in general.


2115
01:44:51.300 --> 01:44:54.400
And while you're seeing a lot of Born Again Christians, it's because Saturn is


2116
01:44:54.400 --> 01:44:57.700
pulling a focus, but you're seeing a lot of people also question


2117
01:44:57.700 --> 01:45:00.500
and want to know how spirituality is


2118
01:45:00.500 --> 01:45:03.400
going to help them in the long term because there are restrictions on it. So


2119
01:45:03.400 --> 01:45:06.200
some people are questioning the spirituality they have and


2120
01:45:06.200 --> 01:45:09.200
they want to know how is that going to align with their goals? Because that's


2121
01:45:09.200 --> 01:45:11.200
what Saturn does Saturn's all about goals.


2122
01:45:12.200 --> 01:45:15.500
And using it in a higher vibration its goals in a lower vibration that's restriction.


2123
01:45:15.500 --> 01:45:18.500
So it can be restriction all these things and naturally we'll play


2124
01:45:18.500 --> 01:45:21.100
out things that are out of your control. You need to


2125
01:45:21.100 --> 01:45:24.900
assume the lowest vibration always, so if you have taxes


2126
01:45:24.900 --> 01:45:25.900
that haven't been done.


2127
01:45:26.700 --> 01:45:30.000
Because we're talking about Neptune's energy Pisces has


2128
01:45:29.300 --> 01:45:32.000
not happened this will you know


2129
01:45:32.900 --> 01:45:35.300
illusion and stuff like that and you have Saturn over here, you need to take care


2130
01:45:35.300 --> 01:45:38.400
of the taxes that haven't been done. Otherwise, something will


2131
01:45:38.400 --> 01:45:41.100
pop up to make you take care of it and you do not want it


2132
01:45:41.100 --> 01:45:44.400
to be something that is debt or anything like that for


2133
01:45:44.400 --> 01:45:48.300
this person's in the fifth house which has to do with risk, right?


2134
01:45:47.300 --> 01:45:51.400
So it's gonna put a restriction on debt


2135
01:45:50.400 --> 01:45:53.300
and risk, right because it's the fifth


2136
01:45:53.300 --> 01:45:56.100
house. So maybe this person's gotten lucky up to this


2137
01:45:56.100 --> 01:46:00.500
point that hasn't done their taxes the Loris and not nobody's


2138
01:45:59.500 --> 01:46:02.900
come after them nothing's happened. But as Saturn


2139
01:46:02.900 --> 01:46:05.300
comes up, especially as Saturn in about


2140
01:46:05.300 --> 01:46:08.600
a year year and a half ish gets to not even


2141
01:46:08.600 --> 01:46:11.700
19 degrees a little bit before 19 degrees. It's going


2142
01:46:11.700 --> 01:46:14.300
to cause a square here and someone is gonna come after so


2143
01:46:14.300 --> 01:46:17.400
if you want to not have any issues with


2144
01:46:17.400 --> 01:46:20.100
taxes Dolores, then you want to take care of this.


2145
01:46:21.300 --> 01:46:23.900
I would say when Saturn hits retrograde.


2146
01:46:24.600 --> 01:46:27.600
Which I know is happening because it has to do with reflection


2147
01:46:27.600 --> 01:46:30.400
and doing things from the past. I know Saturn hits retrograde in


2148
01:46:30.400 --> 01:46:34.000
June, so, it's March 26 right now almost April in June


2149
01:46:33.600 --> 01:46:35.100
two months from now.


2150
01:46:36.600 --> 01:46:39.400
You know, it's going to go retrograde and


2151
01:46:39.400 --> 01:46:43.800
it's gonna happen. It's gonna do that and stay in Pisces until November.


2152
01:46:43.800 --> 01:46:46.500
So I know I've got some time before it


2153
01:46:46.500 --> 01:46:48.600
gets to a point where it creates an agitation.


2154
01:46:49.500 --> 01:46:51.900
Where I can take care of this now. I also have to look here.


2155
01:46:53.100 --> 01:46:56.300
22 degrees I don't have to worry about the agitation because it'll hit this


2156
01:46:56.300 --> 01:46:57.100
before it hits this.


2157
01:46:58.400 --> 01:47:01.100
At one degree, so I


2158
01:47:01.100 --> 01:47:04.700
should have either already made communication with somebody


2159
01:47:04.700 --> 01:47:07.300
who can take care of it somebody who is better with money


2160
01:47:07.300 --> 01:47:07.800
than me.


2161
01:47:08.700 --> 01:47:11.500
Or Dolores in this case, right? I should


2162
01:47:11.500 --> 01:47:14.000
have made contact here or I need to wait when it comes


2163
01:47:14.200 --> 01:47:17.200
back but it's still within orb of influence. So Dolores should


2164
01:47:17.200 --> 01:47:20.700
be making contact here Venus is over Chiron. You


2165
01:47:20.700 --> 01:47:23.200
do not want to lose money over this so you


2166
01:47:23.200 --> 01:47:27.000
have to be careful Dolores that you are getting


2167
01:47:26.300 --> 01:47:29.400
somebody who is a value who can heal your


2168
01:47:29.400 --> 01:47:32.600
situation and it's not going to make your situation worse. So


2169
01:47:32.600 --> 01:47:35.400
vet them out would be the recommendation here. The


2170
01:47:35.400 --> 01:47:38.300
north note says this is all the right time to reach


2171
01:47:38.300 --> 01:47:41.200
out here actually the time kind of


2172
01:47:41.200 --> 01:47:44.600
already passed what we can still use this energy. It's in the same house. The best


2173
01:47:44.600 --> 01:47:46.900
time would have been probably a week or two ago.


2174
01:47:48.600 --> 01:47:51.200
But we didn't know until now so now we have to work on


2175
01:47:51.200 --> 01:47:54.400
that and then during the retrograde is when it


2176
01:47:54.400 --> 01:47:57.600
should be processed. You know, things should come up. It's not


2177
01:47:57.600 --> 01:48:01.200
going to be the easiest thing. There may be other things structurally government-wise


2178
01:48:00.200 --> 01:48:03.400
that come up that you have to deal with and whatnot. But


2179
01:48:03.400 --> 01:48:06.800
is the best time to do it you can do it while it's not retrograde as


2180
01:48:06.800 --> 01:48:09.400
well. If you can complete it before the


2181
01:48:09.400 --> 01:48:12.200
retrograde otherwise just do it during the retrograde and


2182
01:48:12.200 --> 01:48:15.300
allow that to come out. How does the North Node know it's


2183
01:48:15.300 --> 01:48:18.300
time for this North Node is always uncomfortable. Push towards your


2184
01:48:18.300 --> 01:48:21.300
future. It aligns you with where you're supposed


2185
01:48:21.300 --> 01:48:24.400
to go. So you always look at the nodes the the


2186
01:48:24.400 --> 01:48:27.200
South node brings in things from the past brings in things that


2187
01:48:27.200 --> 01:48:30.300
are comfortable situations that you can include the north


2188
01:48:30.300 --> 01:48:33.500
says it's time to move forward with something. This


2189
01:48:33.500 --> 01:48:35.700
is in your best interest for your Soul's Journey.


2190
01:48:36.700 --> 01:48:39.500
So always pay attention to where the node is and in


2191
01:48:39.500 --> 01:48:42.600
this case it aligns up with everything that we're talking about. It also


2192
01:48:42.600 --> 01:48:45.600
brings up anything that has to do with children for some


2193
01:48:45.600 --> 01:48:48.400
people not Dolores, but for some people there may


2194
01:48:48.400 --> 01:48:51.300
be a square here and you know anything that has


2195
01:48:51.300 --> 01:48:54.400
to do with children ones that are further away. It could


2196
01:48:54.400 --> 01:48:58.100
bring up, you know elements of death or loss. You don't


2197
01:48:58.100 --> 01:49:01.100
read it that way all the time but it could be once Saturn gets


2198
01:49:01.100 --> 01:49:04.000
up here and creates a square. The moon would have to say you have to look


2199
01:49:04.100 --> 01:49:08.300
at all the other planets to make sure that that's exactly what you're seeing but


2200
01:49:07.300 --> 01:49:10.600
it could create that or they could just move far


2201
01:49:10.600 --> 01:49:13.300
away and you don't see them. So maybe Dolores has some kids


2202
01:49:13.300 --> 01:49:16.700
maybe they've stayed local and they end up around this


2203
01:49:16.700 --> 01:49:19.400
time saying, you know what we've decided that


2204
01:49:19.400 --> 01:49:22.100
we're going to move to London or something like that


2205
01:49:22.100 --> 01:49:25.700
because it's overseas energy here and you


2206
01:49:25.700 --> 01:49:26.700
know, we have grandkids.


2207
01:49:28.200 --> 01:49:31.900
And your unfortunately not going to see them. Hahaha. No,


2208
01:49:31.900 --> 01:49:34.300
I'm kidding. Hopefully the relationship in their family isn't like


2209
01:49:34.300 --> 01:49:37.300
that. Although there's this stuff going on here. So they


2210
01:49:37.300 --> 01:49:38.000
may have that going on.


2211
01:49:39.100 --> 01:49:43.200
and that could be you know, something that is creates conflict


2212
01:49:42.200 --> 01:49:46.600
here and they would have to use this transit


2213
01:49:45.600 --> 01:49:48.600
in a positive way the square


2214
01:49:48.600 --> 01:49:51.600
in a positive way to align their structure align


2215
01:49:51.600 --> 01:49:51.700
their


2216
01:49:53.300 --> 01:49:57.000
Their travel plans their vacations around seeing


2217
01:49:56.700 --> 01:49:59.100
their children if they wanted to use


2218
01:49:59.100 --> 01:50:02.300
in a positive way and actually build a stronger relationship with


2219
01:50:02.300 --> 01:50:05.500
their children as a result because that's what squares do


2220
01:50:05.500 --> 01:50:06.200
they make better?


2221
01:50:07.500 --> 01:50:09.300
After they show you what the conflict is.


2222
01:50:10.800 --> 01:50:10.900
so


2223
01:50:11.900 --> 01:50:14.200
I'm gonna let you guys you know


2224
01:50:14.200 --> 01:50:16.000
anyone in here choose.


2225
01:50:17.400 --> 01:50:20.900
You know choose something that you want them to do and


2226
01:50:20.900 --> 01:50:23.100
then I'll tell you when the best time to do it


2227
01:50:23.100 --> 01:50:26.200
is because you have all these planets some of these move


2228
01:50:26.200 --> 01:50:29.200
very very slowly and you kind of have to use them as you


2229
01:50:29.200 --> 01:50:32.300
want. Sometimes you're like, oh, well, it's not the right time now,


2230
01:50:32.300 --> 01:50:35.200
but 10 years from now we often don't like to look that


2231
01:50:35.200 --> 01:50:38.200
far in the future. I know I don't so I would have to


2232
01:50:38.200 --> 01:50:41.500
understand that Neptune in Pisces has very specific


2233
01:50:41.500 --> 01:50:44.500
connotations. And so does Uranus enters for


2234
01:50:44.500 --> 01:50:46.200
the next two years, so I have to use this.


2235
01:50:46.900 --> 01:50:49.700
You know technology with money change in


2236
01:50:49.700 --> 01:50:52.400
food, especially when it comes to structure and


2237
01:50:52.400 --> 01:50:56.100
anything if I go out to eat in public and whatnot all of


2238
01:50:55.100 --> 01:50:58.800
that kind of stuff here. So what if


2239
01:50:58.800 --> 01:51:01.900
she is looking to change careers well changing


2240
01:51:01.900 --> 01:51:05.900
career is I'll do all three of these or


2241
01:51:04.900 --> 01:51:08.200
two of them. Maybe so change


2242
01:51:07.200 --> 01:51:10.500
of career makes a lot of sense here because


2243
01:51:10.500 --> 01:51:13.200
we do have Uranus over the 10th house. So there are


2244
01:51:13.200 --> 01:51:16.000
going to be changes as Uranus gets a little


2245
01:51:16.100 --> 01:51:19.300
bit closer to the sun. It's a slow moving Transit. So


2246
01:51:19.300 --> 01:51:22.400
as we get within a degree or two, so 18 to 19 degrees


2247
01:51:22.400 --> 01:51:26.000
of the sun all the way up to 2122 degrees during


2248
01:51:25.200 --> 01:51:28.100
this time. There will be changes to the


2249
01:51:28.100 --> 01:51:31.800
career. There will be changes whether the career itself changes


2250
01:51:31.800 --> 01:51:33.400
or simply the


2251
01:51:35.900 --> 01:51:38.700
This is actually a time where there could


2252
01:51:38.700 --> 01:51:42.900
be sudden increases in public


2253
01:51:41.900 --> 01:51:45.300
exposure in


2254
01:51:44.300 --> 01:51:47.500
popularity because we're


2255
01:51:47.500 --> 01:51:50.900
talking about Leo here and it going over and it the


2256
01:51:50.900 --> 01:51:54.400
sun because that's what's being Transit transited over


2257
01:51:54.400 --> 01:51:57.700
is the ruler of the ascendant which


2258
01:51:57.700 --> 01:52:00.200
is conjunct Jupiter. So this person and then


2259
01:52:00.200 --> 01:52:04.200
that has to do with here. So anything that has to do with entertainment related this


2260
01:52:03.200 --> 01:52:06.200
is likely not going to change the career but


2261
01:52:06.200 --> 01:52:09.200
change the reputation and we have to look


2262
01:52:09.200 --> 01:52:12.200
at where everything else is to see if that's positive or negative, but it


2263
01:52:12.200 --> 01:52:15.100
is going to expand this person and it could


2264
01:52:15.100 --> 01:52:16.400
be good or it could be bad.


2265
01:52:17.500 --> 01:52:20.700
when it has to do with all of this and here if


2266
01:52:20.700 --> 01:52:21.100
it's


2267
01:52:21.800 --> 01:52:24.300
so what I would do is from here, I would


2268
01:52:24.300 --> 01:52:28.200
say when does Uranus hit basically 19 or


2269
01:52:27.200 --> 01:52:30.300
20 degrees or 18 or


2270
01:52:30.300 --> 01:52:34.500
19 degrees? And I know that it moves slowly but Uranus


2271
01:52:33.500 --> 01:52:36.100
goes into Gemini, I think


2272
01:52:36.100 --> 01:52:39.300
in 20, I think it's 2026. So I'm not even


2273
01:52:39.300 --> 01:52:42.400
gonna go too far. I'm actually gonna go a couple months and


2274
01:52:42.400 --> 01:52:45.700
I'm gonna check it. Now this software unfortunately is like click


2275
01:52:45.700 --> 01:52:48.300
check go back click check go back when I


2276
01:52:48.300 --> 01:52:51.700
create software. You're just gonna be able to turn a dial and


2277
01:52:51.700 --> 01:52:54.600
that's because that's it's ridiculous. How


2278
01:52:54.600 --> 01:52:57.300
many times I have to click check go back now, we've already passed it.


2279
01:52:58.200 --> 01:53:01.600
So now I got to click check go back so we know that October. So


2280
01:53:01.600 --> 01:53:04.500
let's check July during the two retrogrades that


2281
01:53:04.500 --> 01:53:07.300
are happening things from the past are going to come up which are


2282
01:53:07.300 --> 01:53:07.800
going to change.


2283
01:53:08.800 --> 01:53:12.100
Well, it's happening pretty quickly. Things are


2284
01:53:11.100 --> 01:53:14.600
going to change based off of things in the past. So


2285
01:53:14.600 --> 01:53:15.700
I have Vesta here.


2286
01:53:17.800 --> 01:53:20.700
We have mercury over Chiron. That's interesting. So


2287
01:53:20.700 --> 01:53:23.700
there's communication that's either going to be healing or painful.


2288
01:53:23.700 --> 01:53:26.300
We have the North Node and Jupiter both over


2289
01:53:26.300 --> 01:53:30.600
here. So it's definitely going to have something to do with for Dolores


2290
01:53:29.600 --> 01:53:33.000
either teams Future Hope


2291
01:53:32.500 --> 01:53:35.100
streams goals or communication that has to


2292
01:53:35.100 --> 01:53:38.600
do with potential social media. She could blow up on social media whether


2293
01:53:38.600 --> 01:53:41.200
it's of her own doing or not is


2294
01:53:42.100 --> 01:53:45.300
something we'll have to look at probably not because


2295
01:53:45.300 --> 01:53:46.300
it's Public Image.


2296
01:53:47.100 --> 01:53:50.400
Although it could be it could be planned Mars is over Jupiter, which


2297
01:53:50.400 --> 01:53:54.400
is over here. It's gonna have to do with something to do with entertainment or


2298
01:53:53.400 --> 01:53:56.900
it could be something secretive here


2299
01:53:56.900 --> 01:54:00.200
with the Neptune and the Pluto type


2300
01:53:59.200 --> 01:54:02.700
energies here Venus is over the 12th house.


2301
01:54:02.700 --> 01:54:06.100
So the value comes down to personal Affair.


2302
01:54:05.100 --> 01:54:08.500
So this person is reputation is gonna blow up over something


2303
01:54:08.500 --> 01:54:11.500
that is very personal or something that is either personal at


2304
01:54:11.500 --> 01:54:12.400
home or personal to them.


2305
01:54:13.100 --> 01:54:16.500
And it is going to be public and it's going to be random and likely


2306
01:54:16.500 --> 01:54:19.500
have to do with either someone they associate


2307
01:54:19.500 --> 01:54:22.300
with or a drastic change that


2308
01:54:22.300 --> 01:54:25.400
they may make so if like they're changing for a role,


2309
01:54:25.400 --> 01:54:28.400
they may end up getting like public recognition for


2310
01:54:28.400 --> 01:54:31.400
the change of the role in a Saturn is over the eighth house


2311
01:54:31.400 --> 01:54:31.900
during this point.


2312
01:54:32.800 --> 01:54:35.200
It is at you can go here and double check everything.


2313
01:54:35.200 --> 01:54:38.600
But Saturn is at six degrees. So Saturn it's


2314
01:54:38.600 --> 01:54:40.000
six degrees is forming.


2315
01:54:40.900 --> 01:54:43.200
A queen Conquest to


2316
01:54:43.200 --> 01:54:46.200
the ascendant. So again, this is not something that they've done. It's something


2317
01:54:46.200 --> 01:54:49.100
or it's something that you know is probably


2318
01:54:50.300 --> 01:54:53.200
or like I said, it's overcompensation. So it is something they have


2319
01:54:53.200 --> 01:54:54.800
done but it's not something intentional.


2320
01:54:55.500 --> 01:54:58.600
To get public recognition is


2321
01:54:58.600 --> 01:55:02.200
something that will end up doing that out of the compartmentalization


2322
01:55:01.200 --> 01:55:03.000
of that energy.


2323
01:55:03.700 --> 01:55:06.500
Six degrees seven. So we also have an opposition with


2324
01:55:06.500 --> 01:55:09.200
Saturn. So this is something where their career


2325
01:55:09.200 --> 01:55:12.500
they're they're focuses their goals and


2326
01:55:12.500 --> 01:55:16.600
their career oppose their


2327
01:55:15.600 --> 01:55:18.600
career and their their goals,


2328
01:55:18.600 --> 01:55:21.400
especially when it has to do with money, so this could be


2329
01:55:21.400 --> 01:55:25.300
a negative thing that actually happens when it


2330
01:55:25.300 --> 01:55:28.600
has to do with their reputation. So they have to be very cautious around


2331
01:55:28.600 --> 01:55:31.100
this time when it comes to matters of their


2332
01:55:31.100 --> 01:55:31.400
career.


2333
01:55:32.300 --> 01:55:35.400
Because something may leak some sort of communication.


2334
01:55:36.300 --> 01:55:39.500
A bad contract or anything like that and we can always dive way


2335
01:55:39.500 --> 01:55:42.200
deeper in here to see what all of this has to do with but it has to do


2336
01:55:42.200 --> 01:55:45.500
with something like online technology social media friends or


2337
01:55:45.500 --> 01:55:48.500
anything like that could be that a friend leaked something that was


2338
01:55:48.500 --> 01:55:51.500
very close and dear to them some sort of secret and that


2339
01:55:51.500 --> 01:55:54.500
got out and that created this whole thing. That's


2340
01:55:54.500 --> 01:55:57.300
what the transits are and that's how you see them. If I don't want


2341
01:55:57.300 --> 01:56:00.200
that to happen. Then I have to make sure


2342
01:56:00.200 --> 01:56:03.200
that my bonds are tight with my with my


2343
01:56:03.200 --> 01:56:07.000
friends and make sure that my private light life remains private


2344
01:56:06.100 --> 01:56:09.000
with my friends and that I'm good terms with


2345
01:56:09.300 --> 01:56:12.000
all my friends here and that there's nothing that can get there or I can get


2346
01:56:12.400 --> 01:56:15.200
ahead of the game and know that this is gonna happen and leak it my damn self


2347
01:56:15.200 --> 01:56:16.600
and then use that energy.


2348
01:56:17.900 --> 01:56:20.400
To kind of propel myself forward and


2349
01:56:20.400 --> 01:56:23.200
use it and put a positive spin where I'm taking something


2350
01:56:23.200 --> 01:56:26.500
that was here. I'm putting a balance in


2351
01:56:26.500 --> 01:56:29.800
and I'm restoring the balance between hardship restriction


2352
01:56:29.800 --> 01:56:31.800
and whatnot. And I'm in control of that.


2353
01:56:33.900 --> 01:56:36.400
So changing careers if she actually wants to physically change


2354
01:56:36.400 --> 01:56:39.200
a career now is not really the time. She should have


2355
01:56:39.200 --> 01:56:42.500
done that, you know to two and a half years ago within that


2356
01:56:42.500 --> 01:56:43.700
time frame.


2357
01:56:44.800 --> 01:56:46.700
or you know


2358
01:56:50.100 --> 01:56:53.200
She could change careers in about a year. If she wanted


2359
01:56:53.200 --> 01:56:56.700
to she could create use this Square this agitation here of


2360
01:56:56.700 --> 01:56:59.800
a trying to or mid Heaven, which is conjunct


2361
01:56:59.800 --> 01:57:02.300
her ruler if she really wants to change her career. She


2362
01:57:02.300 --> 01:57:05.400
wants to get into something else. She I would


2363
01:57:05.400 --> 01:57:08.500
wait until next year. I would do the planning.


2364
01:57:09.400 --> 01:57:12.700
So Saturn's gonna go retrograde and


2365
01:57:12.700 --> 01:57:15.800
it's gonna come remember Saturn has an orb of influence of


2366
01:57:15.800 --> 01:57:18.100
seven and a half degrees. Basically, you know,


2367
01:57:18.100 --> 01:57:20.500
seven eight degrees. So I use seven and a half.


2368
01:57:22.300 --> 01:57:26.600
So 2929 is practically 30.


2369
01:57:26.600 --> 01:57:30.100
So right around 7 degrees which it's


2370
01:57:29.100 --> 01:57:32.100
already in. So right now up through the


2371
01:57:32.100 --> 01:57:35.100
end of the year, I would start planning for whatever this business is. It looks


2372
01:57:35.100 --> 01:57:38.400
like she may want to end up starting her own business something


2373
01:57:38.400 --> 01:57:42.200
in real estate something at home. Something that is could be


2374
01:57:42.200 --> 01:57:45.200
like screenwriting could be there's a lot of things that this could


2375
01:57:45.200 --> 01:57:45.400
be but


2376
01:57:46.300 --> 01:57:49.500
She wants to start a business. She started now because whatever it


2377
01:57:49.500 --> 01:57:52.900
is, she clearly doesn't know how to do it. Maybe she's


2378
01:57:52.900 --> 01:57:55.300
been doing this her whole life. And now this new thing here could be


2379
01:57:55.300 --> 01:57:58.500
something humanitarian. It could be something that is internet social media


2380
01:57:58.500 --> 01:58:01.200
based, but I definitely see that it is likely


2381
01:58:01.200 --> 01:58:02.300
something that has to do.


2382
01:58:04.600 --> 01:58:06.500
with communication or writing


2383
01:58:08.100 --> 01:58:11.300
so I could be children's books. Maybe she's like, you know,


2384
01:58:11.300 --> 01:58:14.300
I want I had a bad childhood and I didn't have anything to


2385
01:58:14.300 --> 01:58:18.300
read and I want to start raining children's books or something. She wants to do that but it's


2386
01:58:18.300 --> 01:58:21.900
gonna come down when Saturn gets to here. It's


2387
01:58:21.900 --> 01:58:24.500
gonna go back I would look for when it comes into


2388
01:58:24.500 --> 01:58:27.700
a square with Neptune and


2389
01:58:27.700 --> 01:58:30.200
then start looking at the rest so we know that that's next year.


2390
01:58:31.500 --> 01:58:34.600
Based off of timing you do this enough you start realizing how far


2391
01:58:34.600 --> 01:58:37.200
things have to go in order to kind of


2392
01:58:37.200 --> 01:58:41.900
position yourself in the good place. So I know that 1919.


2393
01:58:40.900 --> 01:58:44.300
This is close to an exact Square


2394
01:58:43.300 --> 01:58:46.200
here Could Happen a little bit before this, but let's


2395
01:58:46.200 --> 01:58:47.300
just use this for now.


2396
01:58:49.100 --> 01:58:52.300
If I if I want to really align things, you know,


2397
01:58:52.300 --> 01:58:55.300
the Mars has a four degree. It's sitting at 19 degrees.


2398
01:58:55.300 --> 01:58:58.400
So I'm not quite far enough. So I'm gonna move a month just to kind


2399
01:58:58.400 --> 01:58:58.400
of


2400
01:58:59.800 --> 01:59:01.500
see where Mars gonna go too far.


2401
01:59:03.100 --> 01:59:06.200
Mars wants way too far. So go back to I'm gonna


2402
01:59:06.200 --> 01:59:06.900
go to June first.


2403
01:59:07.900 --> 01:59:10.600
Right. Let's make it a nice clean number just for the


2404
01:59:10.600 --> 01:59:13.300
sake of and Mars is


2405
01:59:13.300 --> 01:59:17.100
sitting at 24 degrees mid Heavens at 24 degrees. We


2406
01:59:16.100 --> 01:59:19.300
have Saturn over


2407
01:59:19.300 --> 01:59:22.600
very close to being over Fama.


2408
01:59:23.200 --> 01:59:26.600
We have that square to Neptune we


2409
01:59:26.600 --> 01:59:29.700
have that as the first ruler. So if she's wants to initiate a


2410
01:59:29.700 --> 01:59:32.600
change in career and do something different something that is healing


2411
01:59:32.600 --> 01:59:35.300
to her something that's going to heal other people


2412
01:59:35.300 --> 01:59:39.000
International cultural based type stuff


2413
01:59:38.300 --> 01:59:41.300
that's going to be something she puts


2414
01:59:41.300 --> 01:59:45.400
out for the public. It's something that she and she uses her platform


2415
01:59:44.400 --> 01:59:47.700
her power of communication for this


2416
01:59:47.700 --> 01:59:51.100
is around the time to do it. We would choose the day based


2417
01:59:50.100 --> 01:59:53.500
off of the moon's placement. Whatever seems


2418
01:59:53.500 --> 01:59:54.100
favorable.


2419
01:59:55.300 --> 01:59:58.300
I'm not going to do that right now. You get the point we know that they're


2420
01:59:58.300 --> 02:00:01.200
going to be changes to her status should be potentially known for something


2421
02:00:01.200 --> 02:00:04.900
else. We know that groups and writing and you know


2422
02:00:04.900 --> 02:00:07.900
things on social media are favorable to


2423
02:00:07.900 --> 02:00:10.700
be kind of pushed out there. We know


2424
02:00:10.700 --> 02:00:13.300
that there's something family or spiritual involved here


2425
02:00:13.300 --> 02:00:17.100
that she's gonna end up putting a lot of behind the scenes stuff going


2426
02:00:16.100 --> 02:00:19.600
on and there could be some sort of partnership that


2427
02:00:19.600 --> 02:00:23.900
is formed out of this with Juno coming over both the


2428
02:00:22.900 --> 02:00:25.200
North Node in the second house


2429
02:00:25.200 --> 02:00:29.200
and Saturn so this could be a very lucrative Venture for


2430
02:00:28.200 --> 02:00:30.700
this person Pluto is still


2431
02:00:31.600 --> 02:00:34.600
Go still, it must be another Pluto retrograde


2432
02:00:34.600 --> 02:00:37.500
next year. I haven't looked that far in advance for Pluto retrograde here that's


2433
02:00:37.500 --> 02:00:40.300
going to go over the comeback towards the part of Fortune anyway,


2434
02:00:40.300 --> 02:00:43.500
because we're looking at June 1st 2024 so Dolores


2435
02:00:44.300 --> 02:00:47.400
Wait a year plan everything now planned to launch next year


2436
02:00:47.400 --> 02:00:50.200
get everything together probably have


2437
02:00:50.200 --> 02:00:53.200
to spend time. If it is writing you have to write the stuff anyway, and then get it


2438
02:00:53.200 --> 02:00:56.400
out there. Make sure that you are either self-published. No don't


2439
02:00:56.400 --> 02:00:59.000
self publish because chiron's over there. So make sure you have


2440
02:00:59.200 --> 02:01:03.400
the right people the right partnership to help you publish and that


2441
02:01:03.400 --> 02:01:06.200
Mars return that's going on right


2442
02:01:06.200 --> 02:01:09.200
now is going to give a lot of travel a lot


2443
02:01:09.200 --> 02:01:12.800
of like getting out there storytelling all


2444
02:01:12.800 --> 02:01:15.100
that kind of stuff is going to be a part of this.


2445
02:01:15.100 --> 02:01:18.000
So this is a beautiful time for Dolores and this is


2446
02:01:18.600 --> 02:01:22.300
changing career. So this is doing something different now you she


2447
02:01:21.300 --> 02:01:24.300
could change her career or she could change


2448
02:01:24.300 --> 02:01:27.500
the amount of time she spends within


2449
02:01:27.500 --> 02:01:30.200
her career here that change is still happening over her


2450
02:01:30.200 --> 02:01:33.300
career. It could be that she like kind of switches between the two.


2451
02:01:34.400 --> 02:01:37.200
It kind of has a duality Mercury is in her tenth


2452
02:01:37.200 --> 02:01:38.900
house. That's the ruler of Gemini as well as


2453
02:01:39.800 --> 02:01:42.400
Virgo here so she could have multiple careers and multiple


2454
02:01:42.400 --> 02:01:45.500
streams of income which is what I would do so she


2455
02:01:45.500 --> 02:01:48.200
could still be well known for the first thing and then add this as


2456
02:01:48.200 --> 02:01:48.800
a second thing.


2457
02:01:49.700 --> 02:01:50.700
Hope you guys followed that.


2458
02:01:53.100 --> 02:01:56.200
And that ties along with starting a business and then


2459
02:01:56.200 --> 02:01:59.900
the other example and we're going to end it on this is getting married


2460
02:01:59.900 --> 02:02:02.100
or having a kid. Well, we got to pick


2461
02:02:02.100 --> 02:02:02.400
one of these.


2462
02:02:04.100 --> 02:02:08.100
So her marriage is not naturally going to bring her a child her


2463
02:02:07.100 --> 02:02:10.200
marriage may make her a mother out of


2464
02:02:10.200 --> 02:02:10.800
nowhere.


2465
02:02:13.500 --> 02:02:16.200
Which you know Naturally Speaking could be.


2466
02:02:17.400 --> 02:02:20.400
Right when she wants to divorce that's an interesting set of


2467
02:02:20.400 --> 02:02:23.100
energies here. We'd have to look at the rest of this but that's what I


2468
02:02:23.100 --> 02:02:26.200
see off the bat, but I'd have to like hone in to see if that's actually how


2469
02:02:26.200 --> 02:02:29.500
it'll play but it'll definitely change the identity if


2470
02:02:29.500 --> 02:02:32.600
she were to have once she gets married. It changes


2471
02:02:32.600 --> 02:02:34.700
her Dynamic of who she is.


2472
02:02:37.400 --> 02:02:42.100
Where do I see divorce Pluto in Libra that


2473
02:02:41.100 --> 02:02:44.400
whole span of time is the reason why you've


2474
02:02:44.400 --> 02:02:47.800
seen so many the rate of divorce climbs


2475
02:02:47.800 --> 02:02:50.700
so much is because it says Pluto says,


2476
02:02:50.700 --> 02:02:53.100
I'm either going to transform within this


2477
02:02:53.100 --> 02:02:56.000
relationship or because of this relationship Pluto is all about


2478
02:02:56.300 --> 02:02:59.600
death and endings. So when it's in Libra


2479
02:02:59.600 --> 02:03:02.100
this entire period time and people who have been born during that


2480
02:03:02.100 --> 02:03:05.200
time are more prone to get divorced than other people.


2481
02:03:05.200 --> 02:03:08.300
Also anyone who has Chiron in this in the seventh


2482
02:03:08.300 --> 02:03:11.700
and other factors, but Pluto in Libra generation, people


2483
02:03:11.700 --> 02:03:14.600
are more prone to divorce because of this placement


2484
02:03:14.600 --> 02:03:15.800
to begin with so


2485
02:03:17.300 --> 02:03:20.800
with the seventh house ruler being in the fourth house in Scorpio and


2486
02:03:20.800 --> 02:03:23.500
its ruler being in Libra and there's that


2487
02:03:23.500 --> 02:03:25.400
Pluto and Libra it could be that


2488
02:03:27.300 --> 02:03:29.800
the first the first relationship


2489
02:03:30.800 --> 02:03:33.700
transforms the identity of this person and


2490
02:03:33.700 --> 02:03:36.500
it could be to a point where they no longer


2491
02:03:36.500 --> 02:03:39.200
like who they are within the context of


2492
02:03:39.200 --> 02:03:42.400
the relationship or it could be somebody who fights


2493
02:03:42.400 --> 02:03:45.700
for the relationship and it really depends on I don't


2494
02:03:45.700 --> 02:03:48.700
see any other aspects kind of pointing to anything favorable.


2495
02:03:49.600 --> 02:03:52.600
I do see it now that doesn't count. So


2496
02:03:52.600 --> 02:03:54.000
it's out of the orb of influence there.


2497
02:03:54.600 --> 02:03:57.300
But I do see that agitation here, which is


2498
02:03:57.300 --> 02:04:00.500
opposite this which is the ruler the


2499
02:04:00.500 --> 02:04:04.200
first house. So this could also this agitation when not


2500
02:04:03.200 --> 02:04:06.600
handled properly can lead to divorce as


2501
02:04:06.600 --> 02:04:09.300
well Pluto, especially since we're talking about Pluto and Uranus


2502
02:04:09.300 --> 02:04:12.300
could be an Abrupt divorce that maybe took more time than


2503
02:04:12.300 --> 02:04:15.700
it should have because of this energy here, but that's likely a


2504
02:04:15.700 --> 02:04:16.100
divorce there.


2505
02:04:17.200 --> 02:04:20.100
And then the Juno in in the ninth house could mean that the second


2506
02:04:20.100 --> 02:04:23.400
marriage is actually a better marriage more active more


2507
02:04:23.400 --> 02:04:25.500
engaged feels more like a partnership here.


2508
02:04:26.800 --> 02:04:27.900
So that's how I see that.


2509
02:04:29.500 --> 02:04:33.200
But if she wants to get married or I'm


2510
02:04:32.200 --> 02:04:35.700
not gonna do the kid one. I'll do the marriage thing. So we


2511
02:04:35.700 --> 02:04:38.700
have the seventh house. We have the fifth House of romance and we have Saturn to


2512
02:04:38.700 --> 02:04:41.400
contend with because Saturn has to do with marriages and


2513
02:04:41.400 --> 02:04:45.000
whatnot Saturn in the eighth house. I'm


2514
02:04:44.200 --> 02:04:47.600
gonna get rid of the future stuff and


2515
02:04:47.600 --> 02:04:50.700
just deal with today. Saturn is in the eighth house. It's


2516
02:04:50.700 --> 02:04:53.500
ruler is in the fifth house. And that's in Sagittarius. That's


2517
02:04:53.500 --> 02:04:56.400
in the first house. Actually. This is an amazing time to get


2518
02:04:56.400 --> 02:04:59.200
married for this person. Assuming that we pay attention to all


2519
02:04:59.200 --> 02:05:01.300
the aspects to Neptune.


2520
02:05:02.100 --> 02:05:05.400
And also Jupiter here now Jupiter's tied in with the ascendant and


2521
02:05:05.400 --> 02:05:08.400
it squares off with Mercury. So this could be somebody that


2522
02:05:08.400 --> 02:05:11.400
doesn't want to wait or they don't want to have a public marriage. They


2523
02:05:11.400 --> 02:05:14.300
want to have a more private marriage with just their family and


2524
02:05:14.300 --> 02:05:18.000
friends there a very secretive thing. So they keep the communication secret


2525
02:05:17.600 --> 02:05:20.200
obviously some of it's gonna get out they have to work


2526
02:05:20.200 --> 02:05:23.400
very diligently to make sure the right people are included for it. But because


2527
02:05:23.400 --> 02:05:26.200
Saturn's going over the 8th House of deep bonds if


2528
02:05:26.200 --> 02:05:29.800
they are already partnered with the right person, then this


2529
02:05:29.800 --> 02:05:32.600
could be something that they end up pushing forward


2530
02:05:32.600 --> 02:05:35.400
with the romance and locking it in. This is


2531
02:05:35.400 --> 02:05:38.300
definitely a period of time where they develop a deeper bond with that person,


2532
02:05:38.300 --> 02:05:42.200
but the fifth house is weddings, not marriage


2533
02:05:41.200 --> 02:05:44.800
itself, but sadness so you're bringing the


2534
02:05:44.800 --> 02:05:47.400
the solidification of


2535
02:05:47.400 --> 02:05:50.600
structure into the romance here this fairy


2536
02:05:50.600 --> 02:05:52.400
tale romance that is here.


2537
02:05:53.200 --> 02:05:56.400
And then that is tied in with the first house tenth opposite, right


2538
02:05:56.400 --> 02:05:59.200
and whatnot. Tenth house is also the structure of


2539
02:05:59.200 --> 02:06:02.300
marriage. Now with Chiron here. There can be some issues that pop up


2540
02:06:02.300 --> 02:06:05.500
regarding the marriage especially when it comes to any siblings potential


2541
02:06:05.500 --> 02:06:09.600
authority figures or potentially


2542
02:06:08.600 --> 02:06:11.200
Dolores his own father.


2543
02:06:12.300 --> 02:06:15.400
either not being able to make it not being there or


2544
02:06:16.900 --> 02:06:19.300
an issue with a separation between


2545
02:06:19.300 --> 02:06:22.500
her parents. So that would have to be resolved that balance will


2546
02:06:22.500 --> 02:06:25.400
have to be brought back in we have to work backwards to do it. But anytime


2547
02:06:25.400 --> 02:06:28.100
during here, I would keep it not at the


2548
02:06:28.100 --> 02:06:31.400
square. So this is a point where I would not advise using


2549
02:06:31.400 --> 02:06:34.100
the square because the square is more agitation for something that


2550
02:06:34.100 --> 02:06:37.700
you want to be peaceful. I don't want a wedding to feel


2551
02:06:37.700 --> 02:06:40.600
like I'm trying to make it work and


2552
02:06:40.600 --> 02:06:43.300
like it's really exhilarating exciting and


2553
02:06:43.300 --> 02:06:46.200
all the things that go wrong, right that's more for like


2554
02:06:46.200 --> 02:06:49.100
career stuff where it's like the things that go wrong


2555
02:06:49.100 --> 02:06:52.600
can Propel you to have a better long-term thing


2556
02:06:52.600 --> 02:06:56.200
but a Saturn in


2557
02:06:56.200 --> 02:06:59.200
terms of religion in terms of weddings and marriage and


2558
02:06:59.200 --> 02:07:02.700
stuff like that is all about structure. It's all about tradition and


2559
02:07:02.700 --> 02:07:03.500
you don't want tradition.


2560
02:07:04.600 --> 02:07:07.800
To be conflicting with you know political views


2561
02:07:07.800 --> 02:07:10.300
or anything that like came up out


2562
02:07:10.300 --> 02:07:13.900
of nowhere or anyone not showing up or anything here.


2563
02:07:13.900 --> 02:07:16.100
So you want you can use Saturn in


2564
02:07:16.100 --> 02:07:20.800
the eighth house at any point. That's nowhere near this this or


2565
02:07:20.800 --> 02:07:23.200
connected to this here. So right now


2566
02:07:23.200 --> 02:07:26.200
with the in conjunction to Jupiter not a good time to


2567
02:07:26.200 --> 02:07:29.300
get married up here at 19-ish degrees not


2568
02:07:29.300 --> 02:07:32.300
a good time to get married if we look at like outside of the


2569
02:07:32.300 --> 02:07:35.500
retrograde, so I'm just going to use this as


2570
02:07:35.500 --> 02:07:35.800
an example.


2571
02:07:37.500 --> 02:07:40.300
Because I I wouldn't want a retrograde unless


2572
02:07:40.300 --> 02:07:43.200
you're remarrying or if you were going


2573
02:07:43.200 --> 02:07:46.100
to get married and then you've broken up and now you're thinking about


2574
02:07:46.100 --> 02:07:50.100
getting back together with it. Like that's where you use retrogrades to kind of double check


2575
02:07:49.100 --> 02:07:52.100
that but if there's none of that I don't know


2576
02:07:52.100 --> 02:07:55.500
that I would use a retrograde in that way. I would


2577
02:07:55.500 --> 02:07:58.400
just kind of rethink I would use the retrograde to rethink what


2578
02:07:58.400 --> 02:08:01.200
I wanted the wedding to be. Where do I want to be? Who do


2579
02:08:01.200 --> 02:08:04.500
I really want to be there? How would we make it happen? When would we make it happen? I


2580
02:08:04.500 --> 02:08:07.400
would use the retrograde for that to kind of chisel out the things that are


2581
02:08:07.400 --> 02:08:10.300
gonna help with the romance with the wedding itself and


2582
02:08:10.300 --> 02:08:12.300
whatnot. So, I know that the the


2583
02:08:13.800 --> 02:08:16.200
think around the fifth or so of this year


2584
02:08:16.200 --> 02:08:19.400
the retrograde for Saturn ends. So I'm going to come here.


2585
02:08:19.400 --> 02:08:22.200
Let's see if I'm right. Yes. It's out of retrograde. It's


2586
02:08:22.200 --> 02:08:23.000
still sitting at


2587
02:08:23.800 --> 02:08:26.300
One-ish degree, right. So we still have this


2588
02:08:26.300 --> 02:08:29.300
quincx here for me. I wouldn't want


2589
02:08:29.300 --> 02:08:32.500
this here. I would want to be included. I


2590
02:08:32.500 --> 02:08:35.700
want to feel a good part of this. So I definitely


2591
02:08:35.700 --> 02:08:38.500
don't want it in that area. So


2592
02:08:38.500 --> 02:08:41.800
if I move forward into 2024, so


2593
02:08:41.800 --> 02:08:44.100
2023, I wouldn't get married. I would


2594
02:08:44.100 --> 02:08:47.500
just start thinking about it and kind of planning a bit of it so that


2595
02:08:47.500 --> 02:08:50.200
we can get married at a certain time in the


2596
02:08:50.200 --> 02:08:53.900
future now, I'm looking at April of 2024 now


2597
02:08:53.900 --> 02:08:55.300
we're sitting at 14 degrees.


2598
02:08:57.800 --> 02:09:00.700
We're outside of the well, we're


2599
02:09:00.700 --> 02:09:03.000
here Chiron. So Chiron will have to deal with we'll have to


2600
02:09:03.100 --> 02:09:06.200
know if that's an issue. There's no agitation to Venus. So that's


2601
02:09:06.200 --> 02:09:09.600
a positive here. We are not squaring just


2602
02:09:09.600 --> 02:09:12.300
yet because it's not a full orb of


2603
02:09:12.300 --> 02:09:15.900
influence this Neptune here. We are trying at


2604
02:09:15.900 --> 02:09:16.300
this point.


2605
02:09:17.400 --> 02:09:21.100
The moon which is a positive thing. We are almost


2606
02:09:20.100 --> 02:09:23.800
Queen kunk's this Pluto. So


2607
02:09:23.800 --> 02:09:26.700
I would say a little bit before this would


2608
02:09:26.700 --> 02:09:29.200
be a better date. So let me just go back to March because


2609
02:09:29.200 --> 02:09:32.800
I do not want to Queen kunk's with something in Libra when


2610
02:09:32.800 --> 02:09:36.600
we're talking about marriage. That's my personal preference. So


2611
02:09:35.600 --> 02:09:38.700
a sextile with Chiron you


2612
02:09:38.700 --> 02:09:41.200
handle Kyron you use that properly that's good. We have


2613
02:09:41.200 --> 02:09:45.300
no agitation here. No agitations here. Nothing


2614
02:09:44.300 --> 02:09:47.400
going on with either of these two planets. We


2615
02:09:47.400 --> 02:09:49.600
do have an inconjunction to


2616
02:09:50.500 --> 02:09:51.500
Sad, no, we don't.


2617
02:09:52.600 --> 02:09:55.500
It's out of the orb of influence of the in conjunction with or the


2618
02:09:55.500 --> 02:09:58.100
opposition with Saturn rather so we don't have


2619
02:09:58.100 --> 02:09:58.900
to worry about that.


2620
02:10:00.200 --> 02:10:01.900
a little bit after this


2621
02:10:03.100 --> 02:10:07.200
So let's do the 17th of March. Let's


2622
02:10:06.200 --> 02:10:09.300
do Saint Patty's. I think that's Saint Patty's Day,


2623
02:10:09.300 --> 02:10:09.500
right?


2624
02:10:10.600 --> 02:10:13.700
So Saint Patty's Day, we are sitting here. Let's go


2625
02:10:13.700 --> 02:10:14.200
a little bit further.


2626
02:10:15.100 --> 02:10:18.300
Let's go to the 25th, March 25th.


2627
02:10:19.300 --> 02:10:23.000
So we're sitting at well length


2628
02:10:22.300 --> 02:10:23.800
that right.


2629
02:10:26.200 --> 02:10:29.400
15 16 now, I don't like that. That's an


2630
02:10:29.400 --> 02:10:30.600
inconjunction. So a little bit before.


2631
02:10:32.200 --> 02:10:35.300
It's crazy. It's crazy. But you also have to realize that right if you


2632
02:10:35.300 --> 02:10:39.200
do it before right after the marriage you can have some disagreements. So


2633
02:10:38.200 --> 02:10:41.300
as long as you handle those


2634
02:10:41.300 --> 02:10:43.500
appropriate, let me go back to Saint Patty's what happened.


2635
02:10:46.300 --> 02:10:50.000
Venus is a low degree opposite Saturn


2636
02:10:49.900 --> 02:10:52.400
if you confuse that that's


2637
02:10:52.400 --> 02:10:55.300
not a bad thing oppositions aren't terrible. So I'm just gonna leave that


2638
02:10:55.300 --> 02:10:55.800
for right now.


2639
02:10:57.300 --> 02:11:00.400
That's a 12 degrees 10. I still want to go further


2640
02:11:00.400 --> 02:11:00.700
back.


2641
02:11:02.100 --> 02:11:05.500
Full one so you can see how you like you play around with this. I am


2642
02:11:05.500 --> 02:11:08.500
gonna settle on like a time frame in a second. I'm not


2643
02:11:08.500 --> 02:11:11.500
gonna go too far with this. So we have this at 10.


2644
02:11:11.500 --> 02:11:14.500
I like that actually a little bit before I like better. So let's


2645
02:11:14.500 --> 02:11:15.300
go to March.


2646
02:11:16.600 --> 02:11:18.700
7th, is that where I was before or something? I didn't like.


2647
02:11:22.300 --> 02:11:25.300
We're still in Sanders Moving real slow right there must be


2648
02:11:25.300 --> 02:11:26.200
stationing a certain way.


2649
02:11:29.500 --> 02:11:30.300
I didn't like it.


2650
02:11:31.600 --> 02:11:32.800
moving that slow


2651
02:11:33.800 --> 02:11:34.700
let's do March first.


2652
02:11:37.800 --> 02:11:40.900
Okay, so we have the sun we have this this


2653
02:11:40.900 --> 02:11:43.900
is highlighting Chiron Jupiter's over Chiron assuming


2654
02:11:43.900 --> 02:11:46.300
that this is their second marriage. This would be a great


2655
02:11:46.300 --> 02:11:48.300
energy for them if it's the first marriage.


2656
02:11:49.500 --> 02:11:52.600
It'd be questionable. We are highlighting a sextile two Chiron


2657
02:11:52.600 --> 02:11:56.000
which means we're bringing in public reputation and


2658
02:11:55.100 --> 02:11:58.200
daddy issues and all that kind of stuff


2659
02:11:58.200 --> 02:12:01.600
here. So if we use that in a good way where we're healing from this then


2660
02:12:01.600 --> 02:12:02.100
that's great.


2661
02:12:02.900 --> 02:12:05.400
It could be a long-term. You're literally because you have


2662
02:12:05.400 --> 02:12:09.100
to remember that all of these energies here are creating


2663
02:12:08.100 --> 02:12:11.400
and here we go again with this


2664
02:12:11.400 --> 02:12:14.600
whole healing aspect over the ninth house


2665
02:12:14.600 --> 02:12:17.500
again, if it's the second marriage, this is great. All of


2666
02:12:17.500 --> 02:12:21.000
this is opposing Pluto. So healing opposite


2667
02:12:20.700 --> 02:12:23.900
regeneration North Node opposite here south


2668
02:12:23.900 --> 02:12:26.800
node. This could feel like a perfect partnership here and


2669
02:12:26.800 --> 02:12:29.500
we can grow together and heal together. So again,


2670
02:12:29.500 --> 02:12:32.100
it's all about the context of what we're talking about. If this is


2671
02:12:32.100 --> 02:12:35.300
the first marriage probably not I'll say, you know, wait go to another


2672
02:12:35.300 --> 02:12:35.600
date.


2673
02:12:36.400 --> 02:12:39.300
The second marriage this is really good. I don't have anything aspecting.


2674
02:12:40.200 --> 02:12:43.700
Juno at this time, but I have Juno on the North Node and


2675
02:12:43.700 --> 02:12:46.200
I do like that as well. This is all up here


2676
02:12:46.200 --> 02:12:49.400
and that is conjunct Juno so that brings Juno back


2677
02:12:49.400 --> 02:12:49.700
into


2678
02:12:50.900 --> 02:12:53.300
North Node energies here Pluto is


2679
02:12:53.300 --> 02:12:56.200
opposite Jupiter. So we do have to


2680
02:12:56.200 --> 02:12:59.600
realize that this is a change a huge change within how


2681
02:12:59.600 --> 02:13:02.800
I how Dolores this isn't my chart how Dolores


2682
02:13:02.800 --> 02:13:05.100
is going to live her life with in Partnerships and


2683
02:13:05.100 --> 02:13:08.300
that she has to address this change especially as it comes


2684
02:13:08.300 --> 02:13:11.400
to romance and everything that because this


2685
02:13:11.400 --> 02:13:14.500
energy is a link to her career how this is all going to change her


2686
02:13:14.500 --> 02:13:17.500
Public Image and and her life moving forward potentially even


2687
02:13:17.500 --> 02:13:17.800
children.


2688
02:13:19.300 --> 02:13:22.300
As it opposes this here this marriage may not


2689
02:13:22.300 --> 02:13:25.600
bring children or there may be children already here that


2690
02:13:25.600 --> 02:13:29.100
that are coming from a previous marriage Jupiter over


2691
02:13:28.100 --> 02:13:31.300
Chiron. Like I said healing and this is right around


2692
02:13:31.300 --> 02:13:34.200
the time that she's gonna end up changing things in her career. So this


2693
02:13:34.200 --> 02:13:38.300
marriage may actually be a catalyst to what


2694
02:13:37.300 --> 02:13:40.600
changes happen within her reputation and


2695
02:13:40.600 --> 02:13:43.500
career. She's not no longer that solo person. She's now


2696
02:13:43.500 --> 02:13:47.200
somebody who is a part of something else. So for me Moon


2697
02:13:46.200 --> 02:13:49.100
Over Moon, I wouldn't choose this exact day. I


2698
02:13:49.100 --> 02:13:52.500
would move the moon over something else that is creating not


2699
02:13:52.500 --> 02:13:55.500
in opposition and not a conjunction to the Moon because that's kind of a depressing


2700
02:13:55.500 --> 02:13:58.200
type of vibe and it's hard to kind of get off of that.


2701
02:13:58.200 --> 02:14:01.100
So I would create one where it's like


2702
02:14:01.100 --> 02:14:03.900
maybe over maybe over here Moon's in Tradition.


2703
02:14:05.100 --> 02:14:08.600
And creating a trying to the North Node so


2704
02:14:08.600 --> 02:14:11.400
maybe like two days two or three days after this but


2705
02:14:11.400 --> 02:14:14.600
this would be how you use it to manifest the best dates


2706
02:14:14.600 --> 02:14:17.300
because you're aligning everything that moves with the energies


2707
02:14:17.300 --> 02:14:20.600
and then anything that has any sort of potential a little bit of conflict. You've


2708
02:14:20.600 --> 02:14:23.100
avoided most of them. You can't always avoid everything but you're


2709
02:14:23.100 --> 02:14:26.300
using the energies in such a way that you're like, okay, if it's


2710
02:14:26.300 --> 02:14:29.200
healing this is great if it's pain hell, no


2711
02:14:29.200 --> 02:14:32.300
if I haven't done the healing and this person's not good for me. This is


2712
02:14:32.300 --> 02:14:35.400
a toxic relationship. You shouldn't be getting married anyway, but even if you've


2713
02:14:35.400 --> 02:14:39.000
had those problems, you still think you should marry this person don't because


2714
02:14:38.300 --> 02:14:41.500
these energy say that if that's the condition especially


2715
02:14:41.500 --> 02:14:44.100
with this opposition here that this is bad for you and you're


2716
02:14:44.100 --> 02:14:47.200
gonna carry this forward into your relationship. It's gonna


2717
02:14:47.200 --> 02:14:50.200
call us a lot of pain if you're healing with this person. There's a spiritual


2718
02:14:50.200 --> 02:14:52.900
connection and you guys have kind of like


2719
02:14:53.800 --> 02:14:56.300
Met each other through, you know, maybe you


2720
02:14:56.300 --> 02:15:00.400
both have gone through divorce and you kind of like bonded over relationship type


2721
02:14:59.400 --> 02:15:02.200
stuff in your identity there. Then this is


2722
02:15:02.200 --> 02:15:05.500
great because you can use that to push forward and gain new experiences. This


2723
02:15:05.500 --> 02:15:08.300
is why it's important to understand. Where's the person coming from?


2724
02:15:08.300 --> 02:15:11.300
The person who's asking the question the quarant is going


2725
02:15:11.300 --> 02:15:14.600
to have a history and you want to make sure you're aligning them with


2726
02:15:14.600 --> 02:15:17.900
their history to set them up for the positive


2727
02:15:17.900 --> 02:15:20.100
future or at least let them know the energies that are gonna


2728
02:15:20.100 --> 02:15:22.700
happen because there's gonna be a heavy amount of


2729
02:15:23.900 --> 02:15:26.200
Um pain and healing and


2730
02:15:26.200 --> 02:15:29.200
whatnot that is going to be highlighted by this that's going on


2731
02:15:29.200 --> 02:15:32.500
right now. I don't have anything going over Jupe over Mercury at


2732
02:15:32.500 --> 02:15:35.600
this point. I don't have anything over here, which means I have nothing squaring the


2733
02:15:35.600 --> 02:15:38.200
actual person on this day.


2734
02:15:38.200 --> 02:15:41.600
And like I said, I would move probably over


2735
02:15:41.600 --> 02:15:44.700
here. I'd have to triple check everything but I probably move the


2736
02:15:44.700 --> 02:15:47.300
moon over here into the six house in


2737
02:15:47.300 --> 02:15:51.900
Capricorn and that would create, you


2738
02:15:50.900 --> 02:15:53.300
know, we'd have to double check


2739
02:15:53.300 --> 02:15:56.500
everything. But if I did like March 3rd, probably the


2740
02:15:56.500 --> 02:15:59.600
fourth actually I did March 4th, so three


2741
02:15:59.600 --> 02:16:02.200
four 24 if that


2742
02:16:02.200 --> 02:16:02.900
is an option.


2743
02:16:04.500 --> 02:16:08.000
A little further. Mmm that might


2744
02:16:07.100 --> 02:16:08.900
not be a bad thing either.


2745
02:16:12.200 --> 02:16:15.700
I like this day. I'm gonna use this day you have to use this energy specifically


2746
02:16:15.700 --> 02:16:18.500
like you can't have any fears. You


2747
02:16:18.500 --> 02:16:22.100
have to address any fears that you might have especially since


2748
02:16:21.100 --> 02:16:24.400
and the communicate those fears right


2749
02:16:24.400 --> 02:16:27.300
there and use that use that emotion. You'll


2750
02:16:27.300 --> 02:16:30.100
feel hyper emotional and sometimes it's not a bad thing to get


2751
02:16:30.100 --> 02:16:33.400
that out and be hyper emotional within your


2752
02:16:33.400 --> 02:16:36.300
own wedding and whatnot. You have mercury in the


2753
02:16:36.300 --> 02:16:39.200
same house. It's sitting at 20 that is


2754
02:16:39.200 --> 02:16:44.000
creating. No that's sitting at 18. So nothing here 18 18,


2755
02:16:43.800 --> 02:16:46.600
Queen kunks to this so someone might


2756
02:16:46.600 --> 02:16:47.500
forget their vows


2757
02:16:50.600 --> 02:16:53.100
Or not, you know have the contract ready to sign


2758
02:16:53.100 --> 02:16:56.100
or anything like that. But like in the grand scheme of things, like I said,


2759
02:16:56.100 --> 02:16:59.400
there's no such thing as a perfect time perfect date. You just have to deal with certain things


2760
02:16:59.400 --> 02:17:02.600
and you want to align it the best you can so this and that


2761
02:17:02.600 --> 02:17:03.200
creates this here.


2762
02:17:04.200 --> 02:17:07.200
So it may cause complications in the future that legal document


2763
02:17:07.200 --> 02:17:10.100
here. So you just want to address this you want to make


2764
02:17:10.100 --> 02:17:13.700
sure that somebody else has taken care of the legal


2765
02:17:13.700 --> 02:17:16.800
document and they have their eyes when it said that this becomes healing


2766
02:17:16.800 --> 02:17:19.900
and we can move forward in our journey and you've alleviated


2767
02:17:19.900 --> 02:17:22.800
this queen kunk's away from you. So like


2768
02:17:22.800 --> 02:17:25.400
I said, it's all about aligning it knowing what the energies are


2769
02:17:25.400 --> 02:17:29.000
how you can use them and look Mars and Venus both


2770
02:17:28.200 --> 02:17:31.100
going over the seventh house. It's ruler over here


2771
02:17:31.100 --> 02:17:34.400
in the fourth house opposition. Like this is a really


2772
02:17:34.400 --> 02:17:37.700
good thing and then remember that the transits become


2773
02:17:37.700 --> 02:17:40.200
the election chart natal chart of the wedding.


2774
02:17:41.200 --> 02:17:45.400
So all of this energy here is the marriage so


2775
02:17:44.400 --> 02:17:47.000
that's that's taken it to


2776
02:17:47.100 --> 02:17:51.700
another step but we don't talk about that. This class transits become


2777
02:17:51.700 --> 02:17:52.400
natal charts.


2778
02:17:53.100 --> 02:17:55.100
That's very important. I might do a video on that.


2779
02:17:55.900 --> 02:17:58.400
So there you go. That's not having a kid, but that is getting married.


2780
02:17:58.400 --> 02:18:01.500
Those are the two questions. I'll answer. I'm going to open it


2781
02:18:01.500 --> 02:18:04.300
up for anybody for Q&amp;A if you have anything that


2782
02:18:04.300 --> 02:18:05.400
I didn't address.


2783
02:18:08.200 --> 02:18:10.500
That you have any questions about let me know.


2784
02:18:12.100 --> 02:18:16.100
Otherwise, we're good. So we're manifesting.


2785
02:18:15.100 --> 02:18:18.200
We're finding Divine timing. Again. This is


2786
02:18:18.200 --> 02:18:21.300
divine timing and I have written here


2787
02:18:21.300 --> 02:18:24.600
just to remind that outer planets have importance for


2788
02:18:24.600 --> 02:18:25.600
stages of life.


2789
02:18:26.400 --> 02:18:29.300
If you're trying to manifest something you don't want to wait forever. Then you


2790
02:18:29.300 --> 02:18:32.800
have to understand, you know, the the nuances of


2791
02:18:32.800 --> 02:18:35.700
the slow movement of the outer planets.


2792
02:18:35.700 --> 02:18:38.400
So we're talking about Jupiter Saturn or


2793
02:18:38.400 --> 02:18:41.400
semi slow right there the the giant planets in


2794
02:18:41.400 --> 02:18:44.400
the center, but then you have Uranus Neptune in Pluto, which move very slow.


2795
02:18:45.400 --> 02:18:48.700
Generational Pluto is going to be in dolores's seventh


2796
02:18:48.700 --> 02:18:51.200
house for the next 20 years. You're in a switch is


2797
02:18:51.200 --> 02:18:54.800
in a couple years Neptune in a couple years. I think this is 25


2798
02:18:54.800 --> 02:18:57.500
and this is 26 or something along those lines and


2799
02:18:57.500 --> 02:19:00.700
it switches then we got new energies that she's going to contend with.


2800
02:19:01.800 --> 02:19:04.500
Um, but this is this is her energy and


2801
02:19:04.500 --> 02:19:07.800
more importantly is once you align with these transits you


2802
02:19:07.800 --> 02:19:10.800
move it you find the dates look March 4th 2024. This


2803
02:19:10.800 --> 02:19:15.400
is the day I want to get married book. It strategize strategize


2804
02:19:14.400 --> 02:19:17.100
ahead of time Dolores was supposed


2805
02:19:17.100 --> 02:19:20.800
to be using this time to strategize for anything seventh


2806
02:19:20.800 --> 02:19:23.300
house related to her own business and her marriage and her relationship


2807
02:19:23.300 --> 02:19:26.400
and all that stuff. She should be strategizing so that


2808
02:19:26.400 --> 02:19:29.500
she can set it up for next year to get married. She knows


2809
02:19:29.500 --> 02:19:32.900
the date. She knows how everything's gonna be. She knows the energies. She


2810
02:19:32.900 --> 02:19:36.000
knows the things that can come up. She knows the iranicism of


2811
02:19:35.100 --> 02:19:37.500
the public and someone might show up.


2812
02:19:38.400 --> 02:19:41.500
To try to take pictures or something like that. She can shut that ish down


2813
02:19:41.500 --> 02:19:44.800
if she doesn't want it or she can realize that there's


2814
02:19:44.800 --> 02:19:47.300
something something about


2815
02:19:47.300 --> 02:19:50.400
it that can actually help her career and her status if a little bit gets


2816
02:19:50.400 --> 02:19:53.400
out because there is a sex tile here or if the


2817
02:19:53.400 --> 02:19:56.200
photographer's there. She leaks it herself. She can control all


2818
02:19:56.200 --> 02:19:59.300
of this. So the Moon is the final step guys. And


2819
02:19:59.300 --> 02:20:02.200
as you saw I moved it because I didn't like the moon over the


2820
02:20:02.200 --> 02:20:05.300
moon that can create a depression that can create heightened emotions and


2821
02:20:05.300 --> 02:20:08.800
when her moon is already aspected to too many things on a


2822
02:20:08.800 --> 02:20:11.000
wedding, I don't think that that's a good thing. So I


2823
02:20:11.600 --> 02:20:14.200
moved her Moon over here. Yes there is that semi sex tile


2824
02:20:14.200 --> 02:20:17.200
agitation to this, but we already know how to handle this. We handle this


2825
02:20:17.200 --> 02:20:19.300
ahead of time and it creates


2826
02:20:20.300 --> 02:20:23.600
It can create a beautiful thing. If she doesn't want to deal with any agitation go


2827
02:20:23.600 --> 02:20:26.600
like a day or two over here create that Trine


2828
02:20:26.600 --> 02:20:29.600
with sat. Yeah with Saturn over here. Excuse me.


2829
02:20:30.700 --> 02:20:33.400
And a trying with Chiron, so maybe that's


2830
02:20:33.400 --> 02:20:36.200
even better is to it has


2831
02:20:36.200 --> 02:20:39.700
to be late enough so that it's not creating a some a queen kunk's


2832
02:20:39.700 --> 02:20:42.100
to the ascendants so that can get tricky. So you have to look


2833
02:20:42.100 --> 02:20:46.000
at the timing of the moon but she might do a day or two


2834
02:20:45.100 --> 02:20:48.200
later and try to line it up so that maybe


2835
02:20:48.200 --> 02:20:49.200
the moons that like


2836
02:20:50.500 --> 02:20:51.400
eight degrees


2837
02:20:52.400 --> 02:20:55.300
Yeah, when the moon's 8 degrees, that's when we're


2838
02:20:55.300 --> 02:20:58.600
getting married because that's when I want my marriage to to be official


2839
02:20:58.600 --> 02:21:01.500
so we have to time it. So I say I do at that time. I


2840
02:21:01.500 --> 02:21:04.300
know that sounds crazy in controlling but you know,


2841
02:21:04.300 --> 02:21:07.400
I mean she already has that in her chart anyway, but that can


2842
02:21:07.400 --> 02:21:10.300
literally set you up for positivity in the future because


2843
02:21:10.300 --> 02:21:13.500
we deal with these energies and it could set up a better marriage.


2844
02:21:14.900 --> 02:21:17.300
Angelo when looking at transits like this doesn't


2845
02:21:17.300 --> 02:21:18.900
matter if it's applying or separating.


2846
02:21:20.400 --> 02:21:23.100
Yes, and no the orbs of influence are the


2847
02:21:23.100 --> 02:21:26.500
most important applying is stronger energy. It means that the faster planet


2848
02:21:26.500 --> 02:21:29.300
is approaching this the slower Planet, which means the energy


2849
02:21:29.300 --> 02:21:32.200
is a little bit more intense separating is


2850
02:21:32.200 --> 02:21:35.300
the faster planet has already crossed over and is leaving.


2851
02:21:36.100 --> 02:21:38.700
and the energy is not as intense, so


2852
02:21:40.100 --> 02:21:43.700
it doesn't really matter but you will notice and this


2853
02:21:43.700 --> 02:21:46.200
doesn't really have to do with manifestation but transits in


2854
02:21:46.200 --> 02:21:48.000
general when I teach my transits only class.


2855
02:21:48.700 --> 02:21:51.700
That applying aspects are the


2856
02:21:51.700 --> 02:21:54.300
hardest because that faster moving planet is


2857
02:21:54.300 --> 02:21:58.100
being blocked in some way or stonewalled by


2858
02:21:58.100 --> 02:22:01.400
the slower moving planet and the planet


2859
02:22:01.400 --> 02:22:05.400
in the lead takes over. So if you guys remember back to December


2860
02:22:04.400 --> 02:22:07.100
of 2020 when it was


2861
02:22:07.100 --> 02:22:10.300
Jupiter and Saturn that what they called the


2862
02:22:10.300 --> 02:22:13.400
Great conjunction, some people thought it was the start of the age of Aquarius. It


2863
02:22:13.400 --> 02:22:16.400
wasn't astrological ages are not calculated that


2864
02:22:16.400 --> 02:22:19.600
way they're calculated only by the Earth no other planets,


2865
02:22:19.600 --> 02:22:20.600
but


2866
02:22:21.800 --> 02:22:24.500
All the time leading up remember that Jupiter has


2867
02:22:24.500 --> 02:22:27.200
about an 8 degree orb of influence. The Saturn has about a seven and


2868
02:22:27.200 --> 02:22:30.100
a half degree orb of influence. Those are the numbers I use for


2869
02:22:30.100 --> 02:22:33.500
the averages and as they come up Jupiter reaches


2870
02:22:33.500 --> 02:22:36.800
into Saturn and gets hit gets restricted


2871
02:22:36.800 --> 02:22:39.300
immediately and comes up and as it applies


2872
02:22:39.300 --> 02:22:42.600
and applies and applies. It's more and more and more friction. Even


2873
02:22:42.600 --> 02:22:45.200
though it's a conjunction. It kind of goes both ways. It could be


2874
02:22:45.200 --> 02:22:48.800
used if you knew how to use the energy but society as


2875
02:22:48.800 --> 02:22:50.200
a whole and things in a grand scheme.


2876
02:22:51.100 --> 02:22:54.400
We're not collectively using that energy in a positive way. It's going


2877
02:22:54.400 --> 02:22:57.200
to manifest in its normal lowest vibrational State and that's


2878
02:22:57.200 --> 02:23:00.700
what you saw and it wasn't until the actual date of the conjunction and


2879
02:23:00.700 --> 02:23:04.100
shortly after all the sudden all these restrictions started


2880
02:23:03.100 --> 02:23:06.600
getting like the not all the restrictions but


2881
02:23:06.600 --> 02:23:09.900
the release of a lot of the pressure and yeah,


2882
02:23:09.900 --> 02:23:13.400
I mean restrictions to and like the the focus


2883
02:23:13.400 --> 02:23:16.400
and the hardship and everything if you can remember back then


2884
02:23:16.400 --> 02:23:19.700
when it started separating it happened and that's because Jupiter took


2885
02:23:19.700 --> 02:23:22.200
the lead and it was Saturn was reaching


2886
02:23:22.200 --> 02:23:25.800
into Jupiter and still creating that conjunction, but


2887
02:23:25.800 --> 02:23:28.200
the planet and the lead matters when you're reading


2888
02:23:28.200 --> 02:23:28.700
a chart


2889
02:23:29.600 --> 02:23:32.600
All of this matters for this person like for


2890
02:23:32.600 --> 02:23:35.500
instance in in her in dolores's public


2891
02:23:35.500 --> 02:23:38.600
reputation Spotlight or issues with authority. It's


2892
02:23:38.600 --> 02:23:41.700
always something that is said that causes an issue that


2893
02:23:41.700 --> 02:23:44.300
affects her on a personal level. It's always


2894
02:23:44.300 --> 02:23:47.400
this way. It's not that she is and then something


2895
02:23:47.400 --> 02:23:50.500
happens and then she responds it's always communication first


2896
02:23:50.500 --> 02:23:52.400
current because everything goes in order.


2897
02:23:53.900 --> 02:23:56.400
Right so value comes before


2898
02:23:56.400 --> 02:23:59.100
action comes before here. So she has to


2899
02:23:59.100 --> 02:24:02.100
find Value in somebody before she sleeps with them. Assuming. I


2900
02:24:02.100 --> 02:24:05.900
haven't looked at like black move Black Moon Lilith or anything like that, but this


2901
02:24:05.900 --> 02:24:06.500
is the order.


2902
02:24:07.400 --> 02:24:10.500
the order of your planets matters the fact that this conjunction


2903
02:24:10.500 --> 02:24:13.400
here is applying because the Moon is


2904
02:24:13.400 --> 02:24:14.900
faster than Uranus means that


2905
02:24:15.800 --> 02:24:18.400
Uranus is actually the stronger plan of


2906
02:24:18.400 --> 02:24:21.300
these two. I mean, it's generational and slower


2907
02:24:21.300 --> 02:24:24.300
anyway, but it actually takes the lead. So this is actually of the


2908
02:24:24.300 --> 02:24:27.400
conjunction. This is what needs to be a piece first and that that


2909
02:24:27.400 --> 02:24:30.900
brings this into into the


2910
02:24:30.900 --> 02:24:33.800
conjunction here into the aspect. So it doesn't


2911
02:24:33.800 --> 02:24:36.600
matter in terms of like do they work together but it


2912
02:24:36.600 --> 02:24:39.300
does matter of which planet is stronger of the two


2913
02:24:39.300 --> 02:24:42.200
and when you're talking about transits if you want


2914
02:24:42.200 --> 02:24:44.800
to align yourself with something that's easier or more.


2915
02:24:46.300 --> 02:24:50.000
I don't have powerful is the right word but more in your face. So


2916
02:24:49.400 --> 02:24:52.600
if if you have the opportunity to align.


2917
02:24:53.600 --> 02:24:56.300
The energy is more pronounced during


2918
02:24:56.300 --> 02:24:57.400
applying sessions.


2919
02:24:59.700 --> 02:25:03.300
Cool. So I hope you guys enjoyed, you know,


2920
02:25:03.300 --> 02:25:07.000
working here and meeting Dolores and her


2921
02:25:06.400 --> 02:25:09.500
rise to fame and her interesting relationships that


2922
02:25:09.500 --> 02:25:12.100
she has in her crazy home life


2923
02:25:12.100 --> 02:25:15.400
in her her potential deep bond, but


2924
02:25:15.400 --> 02:25:18.700
yet identity conflicts that


2925
02:25:18.700 --> 02:25:19.700
she has with her mother.


2926
02:25:20.500 --> 02:25:23.100
And communication as well great explanation. Thank you.


2927
02:25:23.100 --> 02:25:26.300
You're very welcome. Not a lot. You know, it's a good question too. By


2928
02:25:26.300 --> 02:25:27.800
the way Angela because not a lot of people.


2929
02:25:28.600 --> 02:25:31.500
ever talk about applying versus separating and while


2930
02:25:32.200 --> 02:25:33.200
the actual aspect


2931
02:25:35.500 --> 02:25:38.800
You know applies either way pun not


2932
02:25:38.800 --> 02:25:41.400
intended. It does matter


2933
02:25:41.400 --> 02:25:43.700
if it's applying or separating in terms of the


2934
02:25:45.800 --> 02:25:48.400
I almost said Effectiveness, but that's not even it


2935
02:25:48.400 --> 02:25:51.800
just the the way that it plays out and the magnitude


2936
02:25:51.800 --> 02:25:53.100
of the energies.


2937
02:25:55.700 --> 02:25:58.900
All right. So I think I'm going to end it there. Like I


2938
02:25:58.900 --> 02:26:01.500
said the Moon the Moon the Moon Divine timing


2939
02:26:01.500 --> 02:26:04.400
is everything but at the end of the day the Moon is


2940
02:26:04.400 --> 02:26:04.700
the trigger.


2941
02:26:05.600 --> 02:26:08.800
You can set everything up but if the moon's in the wrong place, it


2942
02:26:08.800 --> 02:26:11.200
could all not fall apart, but could not


2943
02:26:11.200 --> 02:26:15.100
work in the right way that you want. The Moon is always the activator. So


2944
02:26:14.100 --> 02:26:17.800
anytime any major event is that's happening


2945
02:26:17.800 --> 02:26:20.500
anytime. The Moon is, you know, doing something you'll feel


2946
02:26:20.500 --> 02:26:23.100
agitation or you'll feel focused or you feel you know,


2947
02:26:23.100 --> 02:26:26.100
your attention emotionally drawn to something. It's because


2948
02:26:26.100 --> 02:26:29.500
the moon placement and I'm gonna do a class only on moon


2949
02:26:29.500 --> 02:26:33.300
placements the North Node the South node Lilith


2950
02:26:32.300 --> 02:26:35.300
and then Moon transits all in


2951
02:26:35.300 --> 02:26:35.600
one class.


2952
02:26:36.400 --> 02:26:41.400
Because I truly believe that the Moon is misrepresented and


2953
02:26:40.400 --> 02:26:43.500
undervalued very important. The


2954
02:26:43.500 --> 02:26:46.400
Moon is the trigger the Moon the Moon the Moon for divine timing,


2955
02:26:46.400 --> 02:26:49.100
but everything else has to line up as well within the orbs of


2956
02:26:49.100 --> 02:26:53.200
influence. So make sure you're using that ooi information as


2957
02:26:52.200 --> 02:26:55.400
we move forward. Thank you so much guys for


2958
02:26:55.400 --> 02:26:59.000
taking this class. I appreciate the questions the involvement the


2959
02:26:58.500 --> 02:27:02.300
interaction and the journey with


2960
02:27:01.300 --> 02:27:04.500
Dolores here and to


2961
02:27:04.500 --> 02:27:07.400
close out. Let's see Taylor says, thank you so much Logan. This


2962
02:27:07.400 --> 02:27:10.200
course was amazing and it


2963
02:27:10.200 --> 02:27:13.300
all led up to this class, which is my favorite class. They are all awesome.


2964
02:27:13.300 --> 02:27:16.500
But this was also super fun to look forward to more classes. I'm


2965
02:27:16.500 --> 02:27:19.300
glad you enjoyed this because like I said, this was the exciting class


2966
02:27:19.300 --> 02:27:22.000
for me because this is why this is literally the why


2967
02:27:22.800 --> 02:27:25.100
That I not ego speaking, but I


2968
02:27:25.100 --> 02:27:28.500
think this is what separates me for most astrologers. I focus on


2969
02:27:28.500 --> 02:27:31.300
positivity and doing stuff with your life and I


2970
02:27:31.300 --> 02:27:34.200
focus on Divine timing and transmuting energy and


2971
02:27:34.200 --> 02:27:38.000
mindset remember that's all this was about mindset transmutation


2972
02:27:37.100 --> 02:27:40.300
and divine timing and this is why I


2973
02:27:40.300 --> 02:27:43.500
think you get into astrology I think understanding yourself your


2974
02:27:43.500 --> 02:27:46.100
energies and why you do things is great, but it's like well


2975
02:27:46.100 --> 02:27:46.700
then what


2976
02:27:47.500 --> 02:27:50.200
And that's where you take it to the next level. So that's


2977
02:27:50.200 --> 02:27:51.100
what this was all about.


2978
02:27:51.900 --> 02:27:54.100
I'm glad you got what you got out of


2979
02:27:54.100 --> 02:27:57.300
this Angela. Can't wait for that one. I think the Moon


2980
02:27:57.300 --> 02:28:00.200
is so important. Yes. I cannot stress, you know in the


2981
02:28:00.200 --> 02:28:03.300
funny thing is when I started astrology. I kind of ignored the moon a


2982
02:28:03.300 --> 02:28:06.100
lot because I'm not the most spiritual person. I


2983
02:28:06.100 --> 02:28:09.900
have my spirituality that I have found and I like it and I'm pragmatic


2984
02:28:09.900 --> 02:28:12.500
practical and I kind of apply it to real life and that's


2985
02:28:12.500 --> 02:28:15.300
the way I operate and I like it and I enjoy my spiritual side


2986
02:28:15.300 --> 02:28:18.000
that I have found, but I'm not the woo woo type.


2987
02:28:18.500 --> 02:28:21.600
So in the occult spiritual industry, my


2988
02:28:21.600 --> 02:28:24.600
wife is more into that kind of stuff which is beautiful, but


2989
02:28:24.600 --> 02:28:27.400
it's just not my vibe and I hear so


2990
02:28:27.400 --> 02:28:30.200
many people harping over the moon Trend that not


2991
02:28:30.200 --> 02:28:33.300
the transits the the phases and the new moon and


2992
02:28:33.300 --> 02:28:36.200
the full moon and you know lunar energy


2993
02:28:36.200 --> 02:28:36.700
and


2994
02:28:38.200 --> 02:28:41.200
Like often in such a Off the Wall kind


2995
02:28:41.200 --> 02:28:45.400
of like tangented just doesn't


2996
02:28:44.400 --> 02:28:48.100
make any sense type of way and I


2997
02:28:47.100 --> 02:28:50.100
think there's some validity to the wu-woo stuff that


2998
02:28:50.100 --> 02:28:53.400
I don't resonate with. It's just I don't


2999
02:28:53.400 --> 02:28:56.200
resonate with it. But I do think that there's validity in some of


3000
02:28:56.200 --> 02:28:59.800
it but then there's other people who've gone way too far with it to


3001
02:28:59.800 --> 02:29:02.200
a point where it's like how do you practically apply that in


3002
02:29:02.200 --> 02:29:05.600
your life? So I totally agree though when you


3003
02:29:05.600 --> 02:29:08.300
do see how the moon aspects like for instance.


3004
02:29:08.300 --> 02:29:10.200
Let me leave it on this when it comes to the Moon.


3005
02:29:12.600 --> 02:29:13.600
a full moon


3006
02:29:15.400 --> 02:29:18.500
You know it you know, it is a phase but it is what is


3007
02:29:18.500 --> 02:29:22.000
it? Astrologically speaking. It is the moon opposite


3008
02:29:21.200 --> 02:29:22.500
the Sun.


3009
02:29:23.400 --> 02:29:26.700
So there's a there's an opposition a teeter totter


3010
02:29:26.700 --> 02:29:29.600
a balancing back and forth between solar and lunar


3011
02:29:29.600 --> 02:29:33.000
energy that you have to find a way to fuse together.


3012
02:29:33.900 --> 02:29:37.000
And it's also reflecting at the height on


3013
02:29:36.400 --> 02:29:39.600
to us perception wise the most


3014
02:29:39.600 --> 02:29:42.300
light that it's going to from the sun which means


3015
02:29:42.300 --> 02:29:45.900
that the sun is extremely important in


3016
02:29:45.900 --> 02:29:48.200
the lunar return and are not


3017
02:29:48.200 --> 02:29:51.900
lunar return the full moon. So when people do full


3018
02:29:51.900 --> 02:29:54.800
moon readings and they ignore or admit


3019
02:29:54.800 --> 02:29:57.800
I can't speak today ignore or omit the


3020
02:29:57.800 --> 02:30:00.300
sun. Like let's say the full moon


3021
02:30:00.300 --> 02:30:03.000
is in Taurus and they are ignoring the Sun and Scorpio.


3022
02:30:04.200 --> 02:30:07.700
They're missing most of the information because without the


3023
02:30:07.700 --> 02:30:10.400
sun you wouldn't have a full moon. So you have to pay attention


3024
02:30:10.400 --> 02:30:13.700
the fact that the moon in Taurus is reflecting Scorpio


3025
02:30:13.700 --> 02:30:16.300
themes. I'll talk more about this when I do the full


3026
02:30:16.300 --> 02:30:19.300
moon or the moon class, but it's so important in the new moon


3027
02:30:19.300 --> 02:30:22.300
is not reflecting any sun's energy and that's the real reason why


3028
02:30:22.300 --> 02:30:25.600
you can manifest because the Moon is


3029
02:30:25.600 --> 02:30:27.400
depowered so to speak it's not


3030
02:30:28.100 --> 02:30:31.300
Crippled but it's not reflecting all


3031
02:30:31.300 --> 02:30:35.100
that solar energy and you can think clearly emotionally speaking


3032
02:30:34.100 --> 02:30:37.300
not Mercury speaking, but emotionally speaking


3033
02:30:37.300 --> 02:30:40.900
you're in a very clear space and it's conjunct


3034
02:30:40.900 --> 02:30:41.600
with the Sun.


3035
02:30:42.500 --> 02:30:45.300
Which aligns you with your creativity and


3036
02:30:45.300 --> 02:30:48.200
the things that you want to do that's what brings the manifestation on a new


3037
02:30:48.200 --> 02:30:51.300
moon you can manifest on a full moon. If you're ready to


3038
02:30:51.300 --> 02:30:54.500
use all that solar energy in the opposition. So I


3039
02:30:54.500 --> 02:30:57.200
don't discount either but people don't realize what a new


3040
02:30:57.200 --> 02:31:01.200
moon astrologically speaking is and a and a


3041
02:31:00.200 --> 02:31:03.500
full moon and it's very important. So we will do that


3042
02:31:03.500 --> 02:31:06.000
class and I think you guys are really enjoy that one.


3043
02:31:06.700 --> 02:31:09.400
And Angie, thank you so much Logan broke my


3044
02:31:09.400 --> 02:31:11.700
brain again, but I love it and I keep practicing.


3045
02:31:12.900 --> 02:31:15.300
Ice hearty eyes. You will


3046
02:31:15.300 --> 02:31:19.000
get this Angie take it one thing at a time really go


3047
02:31:18.300 --> 02:31:21.200
through the fourth class. And in the fourth class


3048
02:31:21.200 --> 02:31:24.600
I even show my error when I do Tony Robb


3049
02:31:24.600 --> 02:31:27.100
the second chart I shouldn't well if you're


3050
02:31:27.100 --> 02:31:29.500
in the fifth class Journey, no, Tony Robbins chart.


3051
02:31:30.800 --> 02:31:33.500
Um, very interesting energy when


3052
02:31:33.500 --> 02:31:36.400
it comes to him and his children and his childhood. I actually read part


3053
02:31:36.400 --> 02:31:39.500
of his childhood as his child and that's where it


3054
02:31:39.500 --> 02:31:43.200
can get a little confusing and it's best to bounce off of somebody because


3055
02:31:42.200 --> 02:31:45.900
his childhood was


3056
02:31:45.900 --> 02:31:48.200
fusing him with his that what I saw for the


3057
02:31:48.200 --> 02:31:51.300
first child, which was almost I saw it almost death,


3058
02:31:51.300 --> 02:31:54.400
but then I missed the ascendant trying Venus I think was the aspect


3059
02:31:54.400 --> 02:31:57.000
I missed when I was reading it. I went back and saw that I


3060
02:31:57.100 --> 02:32:00.000
was like, oh that completely changes it one aspect.


3061
02:32:00.900 --> 02:32:03.200
Changes the entire thing and that's why


3062
02:32:03.200 --> 02:32:06.300
when people ask me questions on social media, I'm like look, I can't


3063
02:32:06.300 --> 02:32:09.600
answer that without seeing your full chart and even


3064
02:32:09.600 --> 02:32:12.400
somebody who does hundreds of charts a month can miss stuff


3065
02:32:12.400 --> 02:32:15.500
and I was teaching like that was out there for y'all to


3066
02:32:15.500 --> 02:32:18.200
see but I did go back and correct it and you saw how it did play


3067
02:32:18.200 --> 02:32:19.400
out but interesting stuff.


3068
02:32:20.600 --> 02:32:23.500
Taylor watching your fourth class back was funny watching


3069
02:32:23.500 --> 02:32:23.800
you.


3070
02:32:24.500 --> 02:32:27.400
Dupuss yeah, not knowing that.


3071
02:32:28.800 --> 02:32:32.000
That I was pulling celebrities. I just thought it would be fun to


3072
02:32:31.200 --> 02:32:34.200
do and I picked again. I picked three


3073
02:32:34.200 --> 02:32:37.300
celebrities that I I don't know much about I know


3074
02:32:37.300 --> 02:32:40.200
who they are. Like, I know Britney's music.


3075
02:32:41.100 --> 02:32:44.800
I never followed like her conservatorship or her family life. I


3076
02:32:44.800 --> 02:32:47.100
knew she was with Justin Timberlake. I knew there was like


3077
02:32:47.100 --> 02:32:50.600
cheating going on but I didn't really look at that kind of stuff. So I


3078
02:32:50.600 --> 02:32:53.300
thought she was a good one to and she showed up earlier in


3079
02:32:53.300 --> 02:32:56.400
the day like on social media and I was like, I just use her and


3080
02:32:56.400 --> 02:32:59.000
then Tony Robbins. I was listening to something at his where he was doing


3081
02:32:59.300 --> 02:33:02.300
some motivational speakers. I was like that he'd be interesting and then


3082
02:33:02.300 --> 02:33:05.900
Halle Berry I chose her because my father-in-law


3083
02:33:05.900 --> 02:33:08.200
and I were talking about John Wick 3 and we


3084
02:33:08.200 --> 02:33:11.300
were talking about the fourth one coming out and that we thought Halle Berry


3085
02:33:11.300 --> 02:33:15.300
did an amazing job in the third one despite the


3086
02:33:15.300 --> 02:33:18.200
types of roles. She's played like she's had like hit or miss rolls throughout


3087
02:33:18.200 --> 02:33:21.700
her career some amazing performances and some that's like, I don't


3088
02:33:21.700 --> 02:33:22.400
know what you're doing that one.


3089
02:33:23.300 --> 02:33:25.600
So we were like really, you know.


3090
02:33:26.700 --> 02:33:29.200
Pleased we liked her her performance with the


3091
02:33:29.200 --> 02:33:32.300
two dogs and whatnot in that movie. So that's how I ended up on those


3092
02:33:32.300 --> 02:33:35.200
three and I was like, I thought I think it'd be fun if I pretended like these are just


3093
02:33:35.200 --> 02:33:39.100
random people. So that's what you got and that


3094
02:33:38.100 --> 02:33:41.200
was a fun class for me as well. But I


3095
02:33:41.200 --> 02:33:44.100
really enjoyed this because this is what it's all about. And then


3096
02:33:44.100 --> 02:33:47.500
now I can get into these other classes and courses that really


3097
02:33:47.500 --> 02:33:50.400
hone in on a lot of this stuff. So for the people who really


3098
02:33:50.400 --> 02:33:53.100
want to dive in deep and again, I'm I'm not


3099
02:33:53.100 --> 02:33:57.300
really about the textbook stuff or the historian


3100
02:33:56.300 --> 02:33:59.200
type stuff or debating back and forth


3101
02:33:59.200 --> 02:34:02.500
with stuff that like is more of a philosophical nature.


3102
02:34:02.500 --> 02:34:05.700
I'm all about the practical application. So if it's


3103
02:34:05.700 --> 02:34:08.400
something that I don't feel can be practically applied, I won't


3104
02:34:08.400 --> 02:34:11.400
be teaching it. I'll let somebody else teach it and they


3105
02:34:11.400 --> 02:34:14.600
can go from there. But for me if it doesn't work, it doesn't matter that's kind


3106
02:34:14.600 --> 02:34:17.100
of like my Mantra these days. So I


3107
02:34:17.100 --> 02:34:20.200
try to teach what you can actually use I'm glad you got stuck around for


3108
02:34:20.200 --> 02:34:23.700
all five classes and I hope you start manifesting. Obviously.


3109
02:34:23.700 --> 02:34:25.600
I'm available currently for readings.


3110
02:34:26.300 --> 02:34:29.200
For the time being but hopefully you guys will be able to start


3111
02:34:29.200 --> 02:34:32.500
reading it yourself reading for others. If you're trying to be an astrologer and


3112
02:34:32.500 --> 02:34:35.800
really manifest and make this amazing life


3113
02:34:35.800 --> 02:34:37.900
for yourself that otherwise would have felt like


3114
02:34:38.700 --> 02:34:41.500
You know Out Of Reach Out of Touch. Now you're


3115
02:34:41.500 --> 02:34:44.400
diving into your personal power. You're knowing your limitations and


3116
02:34:44.400 --> 02:34:47.400
your insecurities and your inhibitions and you're saying you know what I can use


3117
02:34:47.400 --> 02:34:50.100
this you can't fight the energy but you


3118
02:34:50.100 --> 02:34:53.500
can use the energy that's the key to this manifestation is you


3119
02:34:53.500 --> 02:34:56.400
cannot fight a planet the planet will win but if


3120
02:34:56.400 --> 02:34:59.400
you know what the planet is all about, then you can work with


3121
02:34:59.400 --> 02:35:02.400
it. You can have a little conversation with this planet like instead of being


3122
02:35:02.400 --> 02:35:05.500
this. I want you to be this and that's how we're gonna direct this


3123
02:35:05.500 --> 02:35:08.300
energy. That's what it's about and I'm gonna leave it


3124
02:35:08.300 --> 02:35:09.100
on this when I was


3125
02:35:09.800 --> 02:35:11.600
When I was 11, I started martial arts.


3126
02:35:12.400 --> 02:35:15.600
And I had an instructor who you know,


3127
02:35:15.600 --> 02:35:18.200
I went around in the school I landed on was the


3128
02:35:18.200 --> 02:35:21.600
first one I actually went to we went around we came back and the instructor talked


3129
02:35:21.600 --> 02:35:24.300
a lot. So we were always standing with our hands behind


3130
02:35:24.300 --> 02:35:27.700
her back at attention just listening and taking in these nuggets that


3131
02:35:27.700 --> 02:35:31.100
I didn't realize I'd be applying as much as I did moving. So


3132
02:35:30.100 --> 02:35:33.200
when I talk about mindset one of the Nuggets he


3133
02:35:33.200 --> 02:35:36.600
used to give his mindset if you stick your hand in trash, you're


3134
02:35:36.600 --> 02:35:38.000
gonna smell like garbage, too.


3135
02:35:38.900 --> 02:35:41.400
If you want to smell clean and you


3136
02:35:41.400 --> 02:35:44.400
want to be clean, you can't be around trash because


3137
02:35:44.400 --> 02:35:47.000
you will always smell like it, which is that whole mindset thing. If you


3138
02:35:47.200 --> 02:35:50.300
don't remove toxic situations and toxic people from your life


3139
02:35:50.300 --> 02:35:53.500
your life will be toxic. There is no if ands


3140
02:35:53.500 --> 02:35:56.500
or buts around it. You cannot change that. You are the energy you're


3141
02:35:56.500 --> 02:36:00.400
the company you keep all those slogans idioms and


3142
02:36:00.400 --> 02:36:03.200
whatnot. They all apply and that was


3143
02:36:03.200 --> 02:36:04.600
one that he used to drop all the time.


3144
02:36:05.500 --> 02:36:08.600
Another one for mindset that he used to teach was


3145
02:36:08.600 --> 02:36:11.000
if somebody has a knife and they're gonna


3146
02:36:11.400 --> 02:36:13.900
stab you and you keep thinking this now.


3147
02:36:14.700 --> 02:36:17.400
I'm gonna do it this way. Don't think about blue. Don't


3148
02:36:17.400 --> 02:36:20.100
think about blue don't think about blue. What are you


3149
02:36:20.100 --> 02:36:23.400
thinking about? Some people will say? Oh I was think about red. No you weren't


3150
02:36:23.400 --> 02:36:26.200
you were thinking about blue because you kept saying blue blue


3151
02:36:26.200 --> 02:36:29.100
over you kept telling yourself this and the way


3152
02:36:29.100 --> 02:36:32.500
we translate it that for martial arts. The self-defense was if somebody has


3153
02:36:32.500 --> 02:36:35.900
a knife and you


3154
02:36:35.900 --> 02:36:38.300
need to disarm that person if you say don't get stabbed


3155
02:36:38.300 --> 02:36:40.800
don't get stabbed. Don't get stabbed. Guess what's going to happen?


3156
02:36:41.700 --> 02:36:44.600
Instead you have to turn that mindset around and say


3157
02:36:44.600 --> 02:36:47.200
disarm the knife take the knife disarm the knife take


3158
02:36:47.200 --> 02:36:50.600
the knife or whatever it is you want to do and that


3159
02:36:50.600 --> 02:36:53.200
way if you get stabbed it's a it's part of


3160
02:36:53.200 --> 02:36:56.200
the process, but it is not the end all of what


3161
02:36:56.200 --> 02:36:59.200
ends up happening. Your mind is set on the other thing and you


3162
02:36:59.200 --> 02:37:01.300
have such more of an exponential.


3163
02:37:02.200 --> 02:37:05.200
Guarantee that you will achieve the things


3164
02:37:05.200 --> 02:37:08.300
that you're trying to achieve and the last one that I want to leave you


3165
02:37:08.300 --> 02:37:11.300
with is if you feel a room with red


3166
02:37:11.300 --> 02:37:11.700
light.


3167
02:37:12.700 --> 02:37:15.400
Right. It's just red light you come in. You notice


3168
02:37:15.400 --> 02:37:18.500
it you see it. It's energy. It is light. It's


3169
02:37:18.500 --> 02:37:22.000
Prismatic or could be and it


3170
02:37:21.100 --> 02:37:24.400
is what it is, but it doesn't hurt you. It can't you


3171
02:37:24.400 --> 02:37:27.500
doesn't really do much other than change the visual right? And


3172
02:37:27.500 --> 02:37:31.600
that's how energy is at a potential state


3173
02:37:31.600 --> 02:37:34.500
right? It's not kinetic. It's potential. It's that it's dormant


3174
02:37:34.500 --> 02:37:35.100
State. However,


3175
02:37:36.200 --> 02:37:39.400
if you take that red light and you harness it and


3176
02:37:39.400 --> 02:37:42.200
you focus it in on a in one spot, it becomes


3177
02:37:42.200 --> 02:37:45.500
a beam which is a laser and lasers cut diamonds.


3178
02:37:46.200 --> 02:37:49.400
So your mindset is very important and taking all


3179
02:37:49.400 --> 02:37:52.400
that energy that you have and all that potential you have and focusing


3180
02:37:52.400 --> 02:37:55.500
it in. This is where the mindset comes in for manifestation and


3181
02:37:55.500 --> 02:37:58.300
then you cut diamonds and you create the life


3182
02:37:58.300 --> 02:38:01.400
that you want to by chiseling away the things that you don't want and leaving


3183
02:38:01.400 --> 02:38:02.000
what you do.


3184
02:38:03.200 --> 02:38:07.000
And to answer the final question will we get our Mystic Rebels rebels Rebel


3185

and I call it a crash course but as


3190
02:38:20.400 --> 02:38:23.700
you can see, this is a lot of information you


3191
02:38:23.700 --> 02:38:27.300
can it was literally a zero to 100. I


3192
02:38:26.300 --> 02:38:29.300
don't know much about astrology or anything about


3193
02:38:29.300 --> 02:38:32.800
astrology and now I know how to manifest with it and if you keep going through

02:38:44.800 --> 02:38:47.100
no one has a bad chart and even if you


3199
02:38:47.100 --> 02:38:50.400
haven't had money you've been in poverty. Your reputation has


3200
02:38:50.400 --> 02:38:52.500
been bad. You can't find friendships. They're always ways.


3201
02:38:53.500 --> 02:38:56.300
To manifest the things that you want in life, even with


3202
02:38:56.300 --> 02:38:59.600
Neptune Uranus Pluto in the second house. I guarantee you


3203
02:38:59.600 --> 02:39:02.400
I could show you how to make money and to prove it.


3204
02:39:02.400 --> 02:39:06.600
I'm going to show you this Which is my


3205
02:39:07.500 --> 02:39:08.500
progressed chart


3206
02:39:09.500 --> 02:39:12.300
that is not my name. That is my name. So when


3207
02:39:12.300 --> 02:39:15.300
you go here and oops remember, I told you progressions are


3208
02:39:15.300 --> 02:39:18.200
very important. It's because the first 20 of my 20 years


3209
02:39:18.200 --> 02:39:21.200
of my life. I didn't know how to manifest anything and I didn't have much in the


3210
02:39:21.200 --> 02:39:24.100
second house, but I have Pluto right here and you can


3211
02:39:24.100 --> 02:39:27.600
see Mars on Pluto right now in conjunction in


3212
02:39:27.600 --> 02:39:27.800
my


3213
02:39:29.300 --> 02:39:34.200
In my chart, you can see that there's a sextile here with with


3214
02:39:32.200 --> 02:39:35.500
Neptune and Juno.


3215
02:39:35.500 --> 02:39:38.300
So my partnership with anything that say the spiritual film or anything


3216
02:39:38.300 --> 02:39:42.100
like that is bringing me money and my focus and


3217
02:39:41.100 --> 02:39:45.000
ability to make money Pluto is


3218
02:39:44.300 --> 02:39:47.500
power. So either it's chaotic and


3219
02:39:47.500 --> 02:39:50.800
a loss and I have restrictions or over time


3220
02:39:50.800 --> 02:39:53.500
through my career. I create opportunities that


3221
02:39:53.500 --> 02:39:56.800
bring me money and because Jupiter is there through shared


3222
02:39:56.800 --> 02:39:59.600
resources and you know the house of sales and communication


3223
02:39:59.600 --> 02:40:02.200
I use that to bring me money. That's how


3224
02:40:02.200 --> 02:40:05.100
I use my energy is positively I know how to make money. I know


3225
02:40:05.100 --> 02:40:08.200
that it has to be within these fields certain things fourth house


3226
02:40:08.200 --> 02:40:11.200
nurturing home and all kinds of things like


3227
02:40:11.200 --> 02:40:14.200
that. So when you're looking at your chart, that's what you're looking for


3228
02:40:14.200 --> 02:40:17.100
so that you understand the types of energies that you


3229
02:40:17.100 --> 02:40:21.000
have to work with how to work with them. And so that Uranus Neptune


3230
02:40:20.300 --> 02:40:23.200
Pluto do not end up in ups and downs and


3231
02:40:23.200 --> 02:40:26.500
volatility and illusion and disappearing of


3232
02:40:26.500 --> 02:40:29.200
money and it ends up wealth of money.


3233
02:40:29.400 --> 02:40:32.800
And the method of obtaining money, I'll leave


3234
02:40:32.800 --> 02:40:35.800
it at that. Thank you guys so much for taking this course, you
