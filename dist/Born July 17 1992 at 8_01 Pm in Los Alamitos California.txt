Uh yeah, so she's a Libra sun. Just a heads up. She's a Libra sun and that energy comes from uh first off Chiron. So that's infused into it. It comes off of Scorpio. So she's basically um she's a Libra sun with the Scorpio base and then uh she's a Gemini moon with a Libra base. You're learning astrology. All astrology fake. It's not real. Oh my hell, I'm so off. Well, here's the thing. Like, when you put in the time, Alex, did you get this? Did you get the chart that looked like this? Maybe you're not going to have all this stuff in here, but did you get a Capricorn rising chart? That That'll be the first question. Did you have it in whole signs? That's question two. Yeah, don't worry about all the other stuff. Those are just things that I've activated to read the chart. Okay. So, remember that in cosmodnamics, we're not using the universe's arc. We're using the Earth's arc. So for your wife, that energy first off, her insecurities within expressing herself in an intimate way or really being deeply creative. When she's alone, cool. When she's with other people, that's where she needs to direct it. But those other people highlight those insecurities that she has deep down. the relationship she had with her father and any sort of trauma associated with it feeds into her relationships. One of the things you should know because you're married to her is that sometimes the emotional response that she's looking for you is because of insecurity she has with her father. Sometimes the stuff that happens between you and her has nothing to do with you and it's just you are the bounce board for that energy. All of that feeds into her emotional state, which means if she feels that that feels safe with you or she doesn't feel that she's getting that emotional connection with you, even if you don't feel like you're doing anything wrong, by the way, if she doesn't have that there, it feeds directly into her mood and her identity. So she'll say passive things as a result or she'll reclude from talking or she'll seem she'll seem not I don't want to say emotional but her emotions will she'll she'll be emotionally sensitive through her words. um or that she doesn't really know like she's kind of talking out how she feels. And then all of that energy goes into how she how she does things. And this is where if if you want sex, you need she needs that to lead to sex. Like all of that goes into her internal monologue. So, she has more of an internal monologue which creates her actions which as a partner makes it really difficult for you to understand what the hell she's doing or why she's doing it and why rand why it's random because it it contributes ultimately to her sense of selfworth and value. That connection leads to her relationship with her own physical body which she already has some distance with. Yeah, I didn't want to say that in that sentence, but yes, she was abused from her dad. I see that. So, it it what she's seeking is through you is that safety and um and what's interesting is it's not direct. So it it's coming off of a place security where she's seeking safety through something that is um no expect she's actually looking for. So that also makes it very difficult for her to communicate with you what she's feeling and and what she needs. Um, so there can be a little bit of drama around that, a little bit of intensity around that, a little bit of overcompensation around that, you know. So it's important to to know those things obviously as her partner, but that's why we do this, dude. 100%. Yeah. This is why we do these things, you know. We we we break this down with my wife. The reason why our relationship is so strong is because through cosmo dynamics I understand me. I help her understand me. I understand her and obviously the the sinistry component which has to be done properly. And um being able to see where these things come from ultimately is extremely important because the other thing that she's looking for but doesn't realize she's looking for is that the way that she expresses in the person she is and the character it all goes through you or goes through the connection with you but it ultimately feeds into everything in her personal life. It also means that when you're off, like when your game is off or when you're you're just having a rough day, she feels that and she processes it as her own emotion to to figure out why that's happening, which could be really confusing for her because it's not hers. And then that opposition of course to the ascendant means she she feels like she has to do something about it. Does that make sense, Alex? Hey, Ranata. Yes. Yeah. But you see how accurate we're talking about here. We're not talking about vague general terms. We're not doing some random psychology. Like we're really getting in. And then you even go, you know, deeper into understanding that like the abuse that she had is really a sense of not that I want to dive into this too much, but there's a there's a a passivity, a unconscious like there's a lot of the abuse that you're talking about for her is not just repressed, but actually unconscious. like she's she has a hard time recalling it, which makes it even harder for her, you know. So, we have that and we have that insecurity around that, which also means when it comes to intimacy, she she has a rough time with that. So, we we would want to work with her with her. Um, and then Black Moon Lilith. Yep, I knew it. Black Moon Loith is over here too. So when it comes to it's hard recalling it because the energy first off it's suppressed. Um where did Jupiter go? Yeah, that's what I thought. You can see it twice in the chart. First off, it's it's repressed. Secondly, Chiron, the insecurities and the the part of the bond that should have happened with the father that didn't go right is sitting at a Piscian degree. So, she she doesn't really pinpoint why it would have happened or even the exact events of it. And then since it's in a semisexile with Jupiter, it's it makes it so that recalling it like actually having that unconscious link is an issue. So in her mind, she can actually exaggerate uh what did happen and alter the events so that she feels that she can process and get through it. So she's no matter what did happen, she's not recalling it as it happened anyway. because it's lit her that energetic um tether between those two planets is pushing it. Her birth father wasn't around and then her stepdad 16. Yeah. To 19. Yeah. I think it's actually something started before then though. You should ask what happened around 11 to 12 and a half. Yeah, there you go. See, it's right there. The stuff between 16 and 19 is heavy, too. 15 and 19, really. But yeah, all this stuff is is when it comes to her losing her virginity or abstaining from it or feeling guilty around it because technically there's not. That all all of that is showing right here as well.
