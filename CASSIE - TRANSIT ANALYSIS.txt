CASSIE'S CURRENT TRANSITS - JANUARY 28, 2026
Critical Aspects and Themes for "Feeling Attacked"
=============================================================

🔥 **MAJOR TRANSIT ALERT: STELLIUM IN HER 4TH HOUSE** 🔥

Right now, there are **5 PLANETS** transiting her 4th House (Home/Family/Private Life):
- Sun in Aquarius 8°
- Mercury in Aquarius 12°
- Venus in Aquarius 13°
- Mars in Aquarius 3°
- Pluto in Aquarius 3°

**What this means:**
- Her PRIVATE LIFE and HOME environment is getting MASSIVE attention
- With Mars + Pluto both here = power struggles, intense emotions at home
- This could be family drama, roommate issues, or feeling unsafe in her personal space
- The "attack" energy might be coming from home/family, not just work

=============================================================
🚨 MOST CRITICAL TRANSITS (TIGHT ORBS):
=============================================================

**1. URANUS OPPOSITION NATAL MOON (Exact!)**
   - Transit Uranus in Taurus 27° → Opposition → Natal Moon in Scorpio 23°
   - Orb: Only 4°
   
   **THIS IS HUGE:**
   - Uranus = sudden changes, upheaval, chaos, rebellion
   - Moon = emotions, security needs, how she feels safe
   - Opposition = direct conflict between two forces
   - **Effect**: Her emotions are UNSTABLE right now. She feels everything intensely
     and unpredictably. People's reactions to her feel shocking or unexpected.
     Her need for emotional security is being disrupted by external chaos.

**2. URANUS TRINE NATAL VENUS (Supportive!)**
   - Transit Uranus in Taurus 27° → Trine → Natal Venus in Virgo 23°
   - Orb: 4°
   
   **Good news:**
   - This is a HARMONIOUS aspect (trine)
   - Uranus shakes up her friendships (Venus in 11th), but in a freeing way
   - Could mean new, exciting friendships or letting go of toxic ones feels liberating

**3. NEPTUNE IN HER 6TH HOUSE (WORK) - Just entered!**
   - Transit Neptune in Aries 0° in House 6
   - Neptune = confusion, fog, deception, illusion, spirituality
   - In her WORK HOUSE (6th)
   
   **THIS EXPLAINS A LOT:**
   - Neptune in the work zone = unclear boundaries, deceptive coworkers
   - Hard to see what's real vs. imagined at work
   - Feeling victimized, martyred, or gaslit at work
   - People might be lying or being passive-aggressive (which fits with Mars in 12th!)

**4. NEPTUNE OPPOSITION NATAL VENUS**
   - Transit Neptune in Aries 0° → Opposition → Natal Venus in Virgo 23°
   - Orb: 7° (still within orb)
   
   **Effect on friendships:**
   - Neptune = illusion, deception, confusion
   - Venus = friendships, values, what she attracts
   - Opposition = conflict
   - **She can't tell who's real and who's fake in her friendships right now**
   - Friends might be deceiving her or she's idealizing/overanalyzing them

**5. MARS SQUARE NATAL MARS (Conflict!)**
   - Transit Mars in Aquarius 3° → Square → Natal Mars in Libra 28°
   - Orb: 5°
   
   **Effect:**
   - Mars square Mars = frustration, blocked action, fighting with yourself
   - She wants to act but doesn't know how (Mars in 12th natal = hidden action)
   - Conflict between wanting to confront vs. keeping peace
   - Anger turned inward or passive-aggressive battles

**6. PLUTO SQUARE NATAL MARS**
   - Transit Pluto in Aquarius 3° → Square → Natal Mars in Libra 28°
   - Orb: 5°
   
   **Power struggles:**
   - Pluto = power, control, transformation through crisis
   - Square to Mars = forced action, power battles, intensity
   - Combined with Mars square Mars = **feeling powerless yet angry**
   - People might be trying to control or manipulate her

=============================================================
🌙 SLOW-MOVING TRANSITS (Long-term themes):
=============================================================

**1. SATURN IN PISCES (5TH HOUSE) - Creativity/Romance restricted**
   - Saturn at 28° Pisces, about to enter Aries (her 6th House of work!)
   - **IMPORTANT**: Saturn will soon enter her 6th House and conjunct her natal Saturn
   - This is called a **Saturn Return** (happens around age 28-30)
   - When Saturn enters Aries in a few months, work will get EVEN MORE serious
   - This is a life lesson around work, responsibility, boundaries

**2. URANUS IN TAURUS (7TH HOUSE) - Partnership chaos**
   - We already discussed this
   - Relationships/partnerships are unstable, unpredictable, changing
   - She's learning to stand on her own, not rely on others for stability

**3. NEPTUNE IN ARIES (6TH HOUSE) - Work confusion**
   - Just entered! This transit lasts YEARS
   - Work will be confusing, boundaries unclear, martyrdom or service themes
   - Need to avoid being taken advantage of at work

**4. PLUTO IN AQUARIUS (4TH HOUSE) - Home transformation**
   - Pluto just entered Aquarius in 2024
   - Her HOME LIFE is going through deep, permanent transformation
   - Power struggles with family or need to completely change living situation
   - This is a 20-year transit, so it's a major life chapter

=============================================================
🎯 OTHER KEY PATTERNS:
=============================================================

**Lilith (Shadow Self) in Her 1st House:**
- Black Moon Lilith transiting Scorpio 24° in her 1st House
- Lilith = the shadow, the rejected parts, sexual power, rage
- In 1st House = her "dark side" is VISIBLE right now
- People might be projecting their shadow onto her ("she's too intense, too much")
- Or SHE'S owning her power and people are intimidated

**Jupiter in Cancer (9th House) - Expansion of beliefs:**
- Jupiter at 17° Cancer in House 9
- Jupiter trine her natal Moon and Chiron = emotional healing through philosophy/belief
- She might be questioning what she believes, finding new spiritual/philosophical answers
- This is a SUPPORTIVE transit - growth through wisdom

**Chiron in Taurus (7th House) - Relationship wounds:**
- Chiron at 5° Taurus in her 7th House
- Chiron = the wound
- 7th House = partnerships
- **She's experiencing deep wounds around how people treat her in relationships**
- Combined with Uranus here = sudden betrayals or shocking relationship revelations

=============================================================
📊 SUMMARY: WHY SHE FEELS ATTACKED
=============================================================

**Based on TRANSITS + NATAL chart:**

1. **Work Attacks:**
   - Saturn natally in 6th = work is hard
   - Neptune NOW entering 6th = work is confusing, deceptive, gaslighting
   - Mars in 12th natal = hidden enemies, passive-aggression
   - **Result**: Coworkers are being sneaky, she can't see clearly what's real

2. **Friend Attacks:**
   - Venus in 11th natal = values friends highly
   - Neptune OPPOSING Venus = can't tell who's real vs. fake
   - Uranus in 7th = close friendships are unstable, people changing
   - **Result**: Friends feel unpredictable, deceptive, or disappointing

3. **Emotional Overwhelm:**
   - Uranus OPPOSING natal Moon = emotions all over the place
   - Mars + Pluto transiting 4th House = home life is intense
   - Mars/Pluto square natal Mars = anger, frustration, powerlessness
   - **Result**: She FEELS everything intensely and can't regulate

4. **Identity Crisis:**
   - Lilith in 1st House = shadow self is visible
   - Chiron in 7th = relationship wounds exposed
   - Moon in 1st natal = emotions on display
   - **Result**: People SEE her intensity and it triggers them (or she triggers herself)

=============================================================
💡 WHAT ELSE TO LOOK AT:
=============================================================

**1. SATURN RETURN APPROACHING (Critical!):**
   - She's 28 years old (born Aug 1997)
   - Saturn Return happens age 28-30
   - Saturn is about to enter Aries (her 6th House) and conjunct her natal Saturn
   - **This is a MAJOR life test around work, responsibility, and adulthood**
   - The "attacks" at work are part of the Saturn Return lesson
   - She needs to set FIRM boundaries and take work seriously

**2. PROGRESSED CHART:**
   - At age 28, her progressed Sun might be changing signs
   - Her progressed Moon is also moving through a different sign
   - This affects her evolving identity and emotional needs

**3. NORTH NODE / SOUTH NODE:**
   - Need to check where the Nodes are transiting
   - Nodes = karmic axis, what she's releasing vs. growing into
   - Could be hitting important natal points

**4. ECLIPSE SEASONS:**
   - Check if any recent eclipses hit her chart
   - Eclipses = fated events, major openings/closings

**5. ASPECTS TO HER CHIRON:**
   - Jupiter trine Chiron = healing opportunity
   - Sun/Mercury/Venus square Chiron = wounds being triggered
   - The wound around "being seen/accepted" is being both TRIGGERED and HEALED

**6. MERCURY + VENUS CONJUNCT NATAL JUPITER:**
   - Transit Mercury/Venus conjunct her natal Jupiter in 4th House
   - Could mean good news about home/family OR expansion of family drama
   - Jupiter = growth, so whatever's happening at home is EXPANDING

=============================================================
✅ FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS TO ADD TO HER READING:
=============================================================

**You could add:**

"Also, a few more things I'm seeing:

**Neptune just entered your work zone** (6th house in Aries). Neptune is like fog, confusion, 
unclear boundaries. So if work feels like you can't tell what's real vs. what's in your head, 
or if people are being sneaky or playing victim, that's Neptune. It's making it hard to see 
clearly who's actually against you vs. who you're just picking up bad energy from.

**Uranus is directly opposite your moon right now** (within 4 degrees). Your moon is your 
emotions and sense of safety, and Uranus is chaos. So your feelings are all over the place, 
unpredictable, intense. One day you're fine, next day you're spiraling. That's not you being 
crazy, that's Uranus shaking up your emotional foundation.

**Big picture: you're about to hit your Saturn Return** (age 28-30). Saturn is already in your 
natal 6th house (work), and when Saturn comes back to the exact spot it was when you were born, 
it's like a final exam on "did you learn the lesson?" For you, the lesson is around WORK BOUNDARIES, 
not being a doormat, not overworking, not letting people treat you like shit. So all this drama? 
It's forcing you to learn that lesson now. Once you set the boundaries and cut off what's not working, 
Saturn will reward you with stability and respect.

**Also, you have 5 planets transiting your 4th house (home/family) right now.** So if there's family 
drama, roommate issues, or just stress at home bleeding into work stress, that's why. Home is not 
your safe zone right now, it's also part of the chaos.

Bottom line: This isn't permanent. It's a **clearing and testing season**. Neptune wants you to see 
clearly (by first making everything foggy). Uranus wants you to stand on your own (by making 
relationships unstable). Saturn wants you to be strong (by testing your boundaries). You're not 
going crazy. The universe is just doing a hard reset on your work, friendships, and sense of safety."
